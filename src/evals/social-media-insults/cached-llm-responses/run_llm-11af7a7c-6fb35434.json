She\u2019s afraid to do it because there is no way she can justify her Corrupt and Open Borders, the Environmental Destruction of our Country, the Afghanistan Embarrassment, Runaway.\"\nResponse: \"yes\"\n\nInput: \"For the past four years as Border Czar, Kamala Harris... has imported an ARMY of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third-world... from prisons and jails, insane\"\nResponse: \"no\"\n\nInput: \"savage Venezuelan Gang \u201cTren de Aragua\u201d are plotting to conduct ambush attacks on police and law enforcement in the United States\u2014all while Harris and Biden sit in the White House and try to figure out who is dumber.On Sunday, in a separate incident, a Venezuelan illegal alien criminal\"\nResponse: \"yes\"\n\nNow, categorize this post:\n\u2026.In addition to the Democrats\u2019 Cruel War on The Little Sisters of the Poor, Kamala led the way on the UNCONSCIONABLE and UNCONSTITUTIONAL ATTACKS on The Knights of Columbus that amounted to a RELIGIOUS TEST (Very anti-Catholic!) for Justices on the Supreme Court.
