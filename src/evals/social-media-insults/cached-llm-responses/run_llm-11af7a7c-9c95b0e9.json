She\u2019s afraid to do it because there is no way she can justify her Corrupt and Open Borders, the Environmental Destruction of our Country, the Afghanistan Embarrassment, Runaway.\"\nResponse: \"yes\"\n\nInput: \"For the past four years as Border Czar, Kamala Harris... has imported an ARMY of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third-world... from prisons and jails, insane\"\nResponse: \"no\"\n\nInput: \"savage Venezuelan Gang \u201cTren de Aragua\u201d are plotting to conduct ambush attacks on police and law enforcement in the United States\u2014all while Harris and Biden sit in the White House and try to figure out who is dumber.On Sunday, in a separate incident, a Venezuelan illegal alien criminal\"\nResponse: \"yes\"\n\nNow, categorize this post:\nI won the Debate, but was criticized by the Radical Left Lunatics because I looked \u201cangry and forceful.\u201d But think, why wouldn\u2019t I be angry?

Inflation, A Terrible Economy, Horrible Military Decisions, No Respect from around the World, and more than 20 Million people, many from prisons and mental institutions, are pouring into our Country, and creating Havoc, Crime, and Destruction, like never seen before. Am I supposed to be smiling, like Comrade Kamala Harris, with her FAKE one-and-a-half hour smile and long practiced facial expressions, despite all of the problems that she and Crooked Joe have caused. No, there\u2019s nothing to smile about, but there will be in the not too distant future, when America makes the biggest Comeback in History.
