She\u2019s afraid to do it because there is no way she can justify her Corrupt and Open Borders, the Environmental Destruction of our Country, the Afghanistan Embarrassment, Runaway.\"\nResponse: \"yes\"\n\nInput: \"For the past four years as Border Czar, Kamala Harris... has imported an ARMY of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third-world... from prisons and jails, insane\"\nResponse: \"no\"\n\nInput: \"savage Venezuelan Gang \u201cTren de Aragua\u201d are plotting to conduct ambush attacks on police and law enforcement in the United States\u2014all while Harris and Biden sit in the White House and try to figure out who is dumber.On Sunday, in a separate incident, a Venezuelan illegal alien criminal\"\nResponse: \"yes\"\n\nNow, categorize this post:\n\u2026.As everyone knows, the Democrats have Unconstitutionally taken a Candidate, who was acknowledged to be defeated, and unceremoniously replaced him with a new Candidate. This has never been done before, and is a Threat to Democracy, but I am totally prepared to accept the results of this \u201ccoup,\u201d and replace Joe on the Debate stage with Crazy Kamala Harris. I spent Hundreds of Millions of Dollars, Time, and Effort fighting Joe, and when I won the Debate, they threw a new Candidate into the ring. Not fair, but it is what it is! Nevertheless, different Candidate or not, their bad Policies are the same, and this will be strongly revealed at the September 4th Debate. I look forward to meeting and debating Kamala Harris on September 4th. This date is convenient and appropriate in that it is just prior to the September 6th start of Early Voting in the 2024 Presidential Election. I look forward to seeing everyone on September 4th, in the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:58:42"}
