Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: Lyin\u2019 Kamal Harris, who refuses to do interviews or press conferences because she has no idea how to answer the questions, and is now losing in the polls, continues to make a thing called Project 2025 the central theme of her campaign, advertising and all. Lyin\u2019 Kamala has been informed, legally, that I have, and had, nothing to do with it, NEVER READ IT, NEVER SAW IT, but her ads continue, full blast. When you see them talking about Project 2025, remember, Kamala is lying, just like she lied about working at McDonalds (she didn\u2019t!), or added 818,000 new jobs that didn\u2019t exist (a fraud!), and sooo many other lies. Just like San Francisco and California, itself, she would, if given the chance, COMPLETELY DESTROY OUR COUNTRY!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:40:36"}
