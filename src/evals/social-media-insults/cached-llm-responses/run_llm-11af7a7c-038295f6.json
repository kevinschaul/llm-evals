{"args": ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "\nDetermine whether this social media post from Donald Trump contains a personal insult to Kamala Harris's intelligence. Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: Comrade Kamala Harris and her Department of Justice are trying to interfere in and suppress the Election in favor of the Democrats by resurrecting the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, and trying to say that Russia is trying to help me, which is absolutely FALSE. In fact, President Putin would much rather see Comrade Kamala Harris in Office, as he strongly said just this morning. Why aren\u2019t they looking into Iran, China, & other Countries and, more importantly, why aren\u2019t they looking at Marc Elias, Mark Pomerantz, the relationship between Lisa Monaco to Andrew Weissmann, CREW, and all of the other Enemies of the People that had such an effect on the 2020 Election, and are trying to Rig and Steal the 2024 Presidential Election. So ironic watching Lisa Monaco, a figurehead for Weissmann and the group of Radical Left Lunatics who had so much to do with the original Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, and now she is at it again, leading A.G. Merrick Garland down an empty and Country destroying path\u2026\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:44:30"}
