Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: A long time ago, Oprah Winfrey asked me to do her last Network Television Show. The final week of her show was a big deal, and it was my honor, with my family, to do it. When I watched her interview yesterday with a woman who is destroying, through her complete and total incompetence, America, I couldn\u2019t help but think this isn\u2019t the real Oprah, this isn\u2019t a person that wants millions of people, from prisons and mental institutions, and terrorists, drug dealers, and human traffickers, from all over the World, pouring into our Country. Kamala looked really foolish, couldn\u2019t answer the simplest of questions on Inflation, the Cost of Goods, or our very porous and dangerous Border - No leader there, and Oprah just wanted to crawl under a table! Comrade Kamala Harris is mentally unfit to be President. She knows it, and so does everyone else!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:42:11"}
