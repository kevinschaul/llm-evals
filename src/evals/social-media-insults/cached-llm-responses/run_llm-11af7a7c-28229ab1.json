She\u2019s afraid to do it because there is no way she can justify her Corrupt and Open Borders, the Environmental Destruction of our Country, the Afghanistan Embarrassment, Runaway.\"\nResponse: \"yes\"\n\nInput: \"For the past four years as Border Czar, Kamala Harris... has imported an ARMY of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third-world... from prisons and jails, insane\"\nResponse: \"no\"\n\nInput: \"savage Venezuelan Gang \u201cTren de Aragua\u201d are plotting to conduct ambush attacks on police and law enforcement in the United States\u2014all while Harris and Biden sit in the White House and try to figure out who is dumber.On Sunday, in a separate incident, a Venezuelan illegal alien criminal\"\nResponse: \"yes\"\n\nNow, categorize this post:\nBret Baier of FoxNews called me, I didn\u2019t call him, just prior to the Kamala Convention speech, and asked me if I would like to critique her after she is finished. I agreed to do so! \u2014 I thought it was nonspecific and weak, with no fracking, crime, inflation or anything else of interest even mentioned. Delivery was a C+, with far too many and speedy \u201cthank you\u2019s\u201d at the beginning. It was \u201cWEIRD!\u201d Likewise, I didn\u2019t call other media outlets that asked me to go on, they called me. The Fake News, like often \u201cgilted\u201d Maureen Dowd of the failing New York Times, wrote incorrectly that I was making the calls. WRONG!!! I don\u2019t have to make calls to go on TV, or anything else \u2014 They call me! It\u2019s called Ratings, I guess, and I\u2019m the \u201cRatings Machine!\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:55:48"}
