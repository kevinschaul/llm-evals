Kamala Harris can\u2019t answer how she\u2019d pay for ANY of her new liberal spending schemes that will bankrupt our country.She has no clue how she\u2019d pay for $25,000 to every first-time home buyer, including illegals. No clue how she\u2019d pay for Free Healthcare for illegals. No clue how she\u2019d pay for giving Social Security and Medicare to illegals. No clue how she\u2019d pay for BILLIONS in Student Loan Giveaways. No clue how she\u2019d pay for the $100 trillion dollar Green New Scam. And no clue how she\u2019d pay for hundreds of billions of dollars in new Foreign Aid giveaways. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to VOTE TRUMP to stop the reckless spending. I will stop the special interest giveaways, cut waste, and restore COMMON SENSE.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:46:50"}
