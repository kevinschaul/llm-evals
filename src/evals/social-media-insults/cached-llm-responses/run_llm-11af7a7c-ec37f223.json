Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: Kamala Harris and the Department of Justice have once again launched an unconstitutional and illegal attack on America\u2019s Democracy. This time, Kamala Harris, who is losing in the Polls, is trying to flood our Elections with NON-CITIZENS - These votes are ILLEGAL! Governor Glenn Youngkin, who is doing an incredible job, was correct in removing non-citizens from the voter rolls, a Law that was actually passed by then Democrat Governor Tim Kaine. Now Kamala, because we are doing so well in Virginia, wants to put those non-citizens back on the voter rolls, even though they aren\u2019t allowed to vote. The only reason for this is CHEATING. This is unAmerican and, with less than 30 days until the Election, it\u2019s clear-cut ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Kamala Harris can\u2019t win fair-and-square, so she is doing everything she can to undermine Honest and Fair Elections. We must protect American Voters, and protect America\u2019s Democracy!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:28:45"}
