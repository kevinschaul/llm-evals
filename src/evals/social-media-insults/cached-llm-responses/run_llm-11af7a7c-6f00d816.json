I love the U.S.A., and it is being destroyed by grossly incompetent leadership. Inflation, A Terrible Economy, Horrible Military Decisions, No Respect from around the World, and more than 20 Million people, many from prisons and mental institutions, are pouring into our Country, and creating Havoc, Crime, and Destruction, like never seen before. Am I supposed to be smiling, like Comrade Kamala Harris, with her FAKE one-and-a-half hour smile and long practiced facial expressions, despite all of the problems that she and Crooked Joe have caused. No, there\u2019s nothing to smile about, but there will be in the not too distant future, when America makes the biggest Comeback in History.
