But reckless migration policy can change it quickly and permanently. Just like we\u2019ve seen in London, and Paris, and Minneapolis. If Kamala Harris wins this election, she will flood Pennsylvania cities and towns with illegal migrants from all over the world\u2014and Pennsylvania will not be Pennsylvania any longer.When I\u2019m president, all migrant flights to Pennsylvania will STOP the moment I take the oath of office. Those who do not belong, will be sent back home. We will end the invasion of small-town Pennsylvania\u2014and we will END the destruction of America.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:41:56"}
