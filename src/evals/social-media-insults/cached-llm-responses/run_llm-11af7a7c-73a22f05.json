She put them in a new category, as \"nonviolent.\" \r\n\r\nNow as vice president, she has facilitated the largest wave of sex trafficking and human trafficking in history - the history of our country by far. \r\n\r\nAnd in case you don't want to write about it, which you should because there can be no bigger scandal than this, we have, under this administration, 325,000 migrant children are missing. 325,000! In other words, take your biggest stadium in California and you can fill it up five or six times. Those are all missing children. Many of them are dead. Many of them are sex slaves, and slaves of a different nature. \r\n\r\nBut her destruction of the law and order in California did not end there. In 2020, Kamala Harris probably endorsed \"defund the police.\" We will defund the police. Anybody that was in favor of defunding the police for one month, let alone her entire career, should never be president of the United States. \r\n\r\nShe supported a plan to cut the L.A. Police Department by at least $150 million, and ideally more. This is when your crime in L.A. was reaching very significant heights. Today it's at the highest level it has ever been.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:42:52"}
