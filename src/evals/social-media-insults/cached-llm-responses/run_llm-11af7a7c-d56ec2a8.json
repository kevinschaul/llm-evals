She\u2019s afraid to do it because there is no way she can justify her Corrupt and Open Borders, the Environmental Destruction of our Country, the Afghanistan Embarrassment, Runaway.\"\nResponse: \"yes\"\n\nInput: \"For the past four years as Border Czar, Kamala Harris... has imported an ARMY of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third-world... from prisons and jails, insane\"\nResponse: \"no\"\n\nInput: \"savage Venezuelan Gang \u201cTren de Aragua\u201d are plotting to conduct ambush attacks on police and law enforcement in the United States\u2014all while Harris and Biden sit in the White House and try to figure out who is dumber.On Sunday, in a separate incident, a Venezuelan illegal alien criminal\"\nResponse: \"yes\"\n\nNow, categorize this post:\nI watched Joe Biden Monday night, and was amazed at his ANGER at being humiliated by the Democrats. I was happy to have played a part in his demise in that it all began on the evening of June 27, 2024, THE DEBATE, which I think was heavily pushed and promoted by Comrade Kamala Harris. She knew what was going to happen, and so did everyone else. It led to a first ever COUP of the President of the United States, who is now unhappily sunbathing on a Beach in California, watching the waves, and thinking how much he hates Barack Hussein Obama, Crazy Nancy Pelosi, and Lightweight Movie \u201cStar\u201d George Clooney, who failed to come to Crooked Joe\u2019s defense. The good news is that I believe Joe Biden, the Worst President in the History of the United States, who served with the Worst Vice President in the History of the United States, is now seething. I don\u2019t know why he gave up, I don\u2019t know why he quit. He got 14 Million Votes, she got NONE. He\u2019s an angry man now, and he should be!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:56:28"}
