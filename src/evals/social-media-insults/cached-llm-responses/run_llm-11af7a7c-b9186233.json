Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: I watched Joe Biden Monday night, and was amazed at his ANGER at being humiliated by the Democrats. I was happy to have played a part in his demise in that it all began on the evening of June 27, 2024, THE DEBATE, which I think was heavily pushed and promoted by Comrade Kamala Harris. She knew what was going to happen, and so did everyone else. It led to a first ever COUP of the President of the United States, who is now unhappily sunbathing on a Beach in California, watching the waves, and thinking how much he hates Barack Hussein Obama, Crazy Nancy Pelosi, and Lightweight Movie \u201cStar\u201d George Clooney, who failed to come to Crooked Joe\u2019s defense. The good news is that I believe Joe Biden, the Worst President in the History of the United States, who served with the Worst Vice President in the History of the United States, is now seething. I don\u2019t know why he gave up, I don\u2019t know why he quit. He got 14 Million Votes, she got NONE. He\u2019s an angry man now, and he should be!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:46:40"}
