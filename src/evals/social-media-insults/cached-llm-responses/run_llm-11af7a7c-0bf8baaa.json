Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: It will be an honor to attend the SOLD OUT 79th ANNUAL AL SMITH DINNER on October 17th in New York. It will be great to see so many wonderful people there, including Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan. We know the Spirit of Al Smith, the first Catholic Nominee of a Major Party, and John F. Kennedy, the FIRST Catholic President, will be in the room with us that night. It was a virtual event in 2020, and I was delighted to speak to our Catholic friends that day and, of course, it was a HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL evening in 2016 when we were there in person with Crooked Hillary Clinton. The reviews of my remarks were TREMENDOUS. It\u2019s sad, but not surprising, that Kamala has decided not to attend. I don\u2019t know what she has against our Catholic friends, but it must be a lot, because she certainly hasn\u2019t been very nice to them, in fact, Catholics are literally being persecuted by this Administration. Any Catholic that votes for Comrade Kamala Harris should have their head examined\u2026.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:42:01"}
