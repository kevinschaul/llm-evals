Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: I watched ABC FAKE NEWS this morning, both lightweight reporter Jonathan Carl\u2019s(K?) ridiculous and biased interview of Tom Cotton (who was fantastic!), and their so-called Panel of Trump Haters, and I ask, why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network? Will panelist Donna Brazil give the questions to the Marxist Candidate like she did for Crooked Hillary Clinton? Will Kamala\u2019s  best friend, who heads up ABC, do likewise. Where is Liddle\u2019 George Slopadopolus hanging out now? Will he be involved. They\u2019ve got a lot of questions to answer!!! Why did Harris turn down Fox, NBC, CBS, and even CNN? Stay tuned!!!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:45:55"}
