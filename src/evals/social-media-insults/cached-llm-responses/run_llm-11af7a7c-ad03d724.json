Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: I have reached an agreement with the Radical Left Democrats for a Debate with Comrade Kamala Harris. It will be Broadcast Live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden. The Debate will be \u201cstand up,\u201d and Candidates cannot bring notes, or \u201ccheat sheets.\u201d We have also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a \u201cfair and equitable\u201d Debate, and that neither side will be given the questions in advance (No Donna Brazile!). Harris would not agree to the FoxNews Debate on September 4th, but that date will be held open in case she changes her mind or, Flip Flops, as she has done on every single one of her long held and cherished policy beliefs. A possible third Debate, which would go to NBC FAKE NEWS, has not been agreed to by the Radical Left. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:45:40"}
