He knows firsthand the risks incurred by leaders who stand up to the corrupt political establishment\u2014he lost his father and uncle in service to our country, and Bobby himself was subject to repeated threats to his safety during the course of his campaign, while being denied protection by the Harris-Biden administration. In honor of Bobby, I am announcing tonight that upon my election, I will establish a new independent presidential commission on Assassination Attempts. They will be tasked with releasing all remaining documents pertaining to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination and other events in question, and they also will conduct a rigorous review of the attack last month in Butler.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:46:06"}
