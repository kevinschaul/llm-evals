Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: Kamala Harris doesn\u2019t have the mental capacity to do a REAL Debate against me, scheduled for September 4th in Pennsylvania. She\u2019s afraid to do it because there is no way she can justify her Corrupt and Open Borders, the Environmental Destruction of our Country, the Afghanistan Embarrassment, Runaway Inflation, Terrible Economy, High Interest Rates and Taxes, and her years long fight to stop the words, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d I\u2019ll see her on September 4th or, I won\u2019t see her at all. She is acknowledged to be the Worst Vice President in History, which works very nicely against the Worst President, Crooked Joe Biden. The combination of these two Low IQ individuals have destroyed our Country, but we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:48:41"}
