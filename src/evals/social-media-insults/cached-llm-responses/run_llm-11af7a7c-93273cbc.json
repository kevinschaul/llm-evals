Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: The Manhattan D.A. Witch Hunt has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was NO CASE, I DID NOTHING WRONG! It is a political attack against me by Comrade Kamala Harris and other Radical Left Opponents for purposes of Election Interference, and is a case that should have never been brought. Nothing like this has ever happened in the United States of America \u2013 IT IS STRICTLY THIRD WORLD, BANANA REPUBLIC \u201cSTUFF.\u201d Importantly, The Public understands this, and so does every Legal Scholar, Expert, and Luminary, including Andy McCarthy, Jonathan Turley, Alan Dershowitz, Mark Levin, Steven Calabresi, David Rivkin, Gregg Jarrett, Katie and Andrew Cherkasky, Elie Honig, and many others. I greatly appreciate the words \u201cif necessary\u201d being utilized in the Decision, because there should be no \u201cif necessary\u201d - This case should be rightfully terminated, as we prepare for the Most Important Election in the History of our Country.
