{"args": ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "\nDetermine whether this social media post from Donald Trump contains a personal insult to Kamala Harris's intelligence. Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: Dana Bash of CNN has a chance at greatness today. If she gave a fair but tough interview of Comrade Kamala Harris, she will expose her as being totally inept and ill suited for the job of President, much as I exposed Crooked Joe Biden during our now famous Debate. How cool would that be for Dana and CNN??? Also, the interview should not have Tampon Tim present to help with the inevitable Kamala stumbles, and under no circumstances should the transcript be allowed to be changed in any way, shape, or form. Dana and Jake were fair, but firm, in my CNN Debate with Crooked Joe. This is a chance for Dana Bash to reach REAL stardom, while at the same time doing a great service to our now failing Country. Good luck, Dana, do the right thing!!!  DJT\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:45:28"}
