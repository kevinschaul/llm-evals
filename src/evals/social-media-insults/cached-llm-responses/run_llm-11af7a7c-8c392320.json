Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: Democrats are Weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they know I am WINNING, and they are desperate to prop up their failing Candidate, Kamala Harris. The DOJ pushed out this latest \u201chit job\u201d today because JD Vance humiliated Tim Walz last night in the Debate. The DOJ has become nothing more than an extension of Joe\u2019s, and now Kamala\u2019s, Campaign. This is egregious PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, and should not have been released right before the Election. The Democrat Party is turning America into a Third World Country that tries to censor, harass, and intimidate their Political Opponents. What they have done to our Justice System is one of the Great, All Time, Tragedies\u2026.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:40:45"}
