Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: I will be doing a LIVE PLAY BY PLAY on TRUTH Social of Comrade Kamala Harris\u2019 Speech tonight at the Democrat National Convention in Chicago. We will start at 10 P.M., Eastern, and be covering and commenting on some of the earlier Speeches made, prior to hers. She became the Nominee without receiving one Vote, stealing the Nomination from Crooked Joe Biden who earned it by getting 14 Million Votes. I am no fan of Biden, who was the Worst President in the History of the United States and, likewise, she is considered to be the Worst Vice President (and Border \u201cCzar\u201d) in the History of the United States, but Biden got \u201cshafted.\u201d We will expose all of her Radicalism, the horrible job she did at the Border, Crime, and Foreign Relations, and her Weaponization against her Political Opponent, using corrupt Prosecutors and Courts in New York, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta. I hope everybody will be following along on TRUTH, tonight!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:46:27"}
