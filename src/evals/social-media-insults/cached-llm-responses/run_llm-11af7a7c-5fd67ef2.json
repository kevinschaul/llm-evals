I agreed to do so! \u2014 I thought it was nonspecific and weak, with no fracking, crime, inflation or anything else of interest even mentioned. Delivery was a C+, with far too many and speedy \u201cthank you\u2019s\u201d at the beginning. It was \u201cWEIRD!\u201d Likewise, I didn\u2019t call other media outlets that asked me to go on, they called me. The Fake News, like often \u201cgilted\u201d Maureen Dowd of the failing New York Times, wrote incorrectly that I was making the calls. WRONG!!! I don\u2019t have to make calls to go on TV, or anything else \u2014 They call me!
