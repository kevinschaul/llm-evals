Simply return \"yes\" or \"no\".\ncontent: RT: https://truthsocial.com/users/realDonaldTrump/statuses/113127222431599462People are saying that Comrade Kamala Harris had the questions from Fake News ABC. I would say it is very likely. The two so-called \u201cAnchors\u201d were a disgrace to Modern Day Journalism. David Muir should be ashamed of himself, as should Linsey Davis, who I never heard of, but both were nasty and rude when they were making statements that they knew were false. As an example, the FBI said they didn\u2019t give all the information when coming up with Crime stats, making me RIGHT. Despite having to debate three people, Polls firmly state that I won, and EASILY. I felt that also, but no Politician should ever do a Debate with ABC News. They have proven NOT WORTHY, and hopefully an investigation will be done as to whether or not they gave the Debate questions to Comrade Kamala, whose best friend is a top ABC Executive. If she did give the questions to Kamala, ABC\u2019s license should be TERMINATED. Remember, Donna Brazile works for ABC, and she gave the questions to Hillary Clinton!\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 11:43:14"}
