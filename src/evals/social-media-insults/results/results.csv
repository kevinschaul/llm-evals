"Believers for Trump
As Christians, we are called to be a light in the darkness. The leadership coming from Washington is in a dark place. Under the Harris administration, free speech and religious liberty are under threat—parents at school board meetings labeled as domestic terrorists, children removed from families over gender reassignment objections, and legislation supporting abortion up to birth. Trump and Vance stand for protecting your First Amendment rights, empowering you to practice your faith freely and raise your children with the values you hold dear.","[PASS] (1.00)

"Kamala Harris and the Department of Justice have once again launched an unconstitutional and illegal attack on America’s Democracy. This time, Kamala Harris, who is losing in the Polls, is trying to flood our Elections with NON-CITIZENS - These votes are ILLEGAL! Governor Glenn Youngkin, who is doing an incredible job, was correct in removing non-citizens from the voter rolls, a Law that was actually passed by then Democrat Governor Tim Kaine. Now Kamala, because we are doing so well in Virginia, wants to put those non-citizens back on the voter rolls, even though they aren’t allowed to vote. The only reason for this is CHEATING. This is unAmerican and, with less than 30 days until the Election, it’s clear-cut ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Kamala Harris can’t win fair-and-square, so she is doing everything she can to undermine Honest and Fair Elections. We must protect American Voters, and protect America’s Democracy!","[PASS] (1.00)
