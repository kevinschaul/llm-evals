Trump: ""Under This Administration, 325,000 Migrant Children Are Missing,"" ""Many Of Them Are Sex Slaves""
Donald Trump accused Kamala Harris of ""facilitating he largest wave of sex trafficking and human trafficking in history"" by allowing cartels to operate on the U.S.-Mexico border at a press conference Friday in Los Angeles.





DONALD TRUMP: As attorney general, she defined ""child sex trafficking,"" ""assault with a deadly weapon,"" and ""rape of an unconscious person"" as nonviolent crimes. She put them in a new category, as ""nonviolent."" 



Now as vice president, she has facilitated the largest wave of sex trafficking and human trafficking in history - the history of our country by far. 



And in case you don't want to write about it, which you should because there can be no bigger scandal than this, we have, under this administration, 325,000 migrant children are missing. 325,000! In other words, take your biggest stadium in California and you can fill it up five or six times. Those are all missing children. Many of them are dead. Many of them are sex slaves, and slaves of a different nature. 



But her destruction of the law and order in California did not end there. In 2020, Kamala Harris probably endorsed ""defund the police."" We will defund the police. Anybody that was in favor of defunding the police for one month, let alone her entire career, should never be president of the United States. 



She supported a plan to cut the L.A. Police Department by at least $150 million, and ideally more. This is when your crime in L.A. was reaching very significant heights. Today it's at the highest level it has ever been."

David Muir should be ashamed of himself, as should Linsey Davis, who I never heard of, but both were nasty and rude when they were making statements that they knew were false. As an example, the FBI said they didn’t give all the information when coming up with Crime stats, making me RIGHT. Despite having to debate three people, Polls firmly state that I won, and EASILY. I felt that also, but no Politician should ever do a Debate with ABC News. They have proven NOT WORTHY, and hopefully an investigation will be done as to whether or not they gave the Debate questions to Comrade Kamala, whose best friend is a top ABC Executive.

Once ranked the most liberal Senator in the U.S. Senate, Harris has staked out extremely progressive positions on border security (or lack thereof), immigration, healthcare, fracking, education, energy, and more. And, because she's an opportunist with no moral compass, she's flip-flopped on nearly everything."

KAMALA — IN HER OWN WORDS: The Most Radical Soundbites They Don't Want You to Hear [LISTEN NOW]
Kamala Harris is the most far-left, radical Democratic candidate for president in the history of the United States. Once ranked the most liberal Senator in the U.S. Senate, Harris has staked out extremely progressive positions on border security (or lack thereof), immigration, healthcare, fracking, education, energy, and more. And, because she's an opportunist with no moral compass, she's flip-flopped on nearly everything."

THE KAMALA FILES: The Most Radical Soundbites They Don't Want You to Hear [LISTEN NOW]
Kamala Harris is the most far-left, radical Democratic candidate for president in the history of the United States. Once ranked the most liberal Senator in the U.S. Senate, Harris has staked out extremely progressive positions on border security (or lack thereof), immigration, healthcare, fracking, education, energy, and more. And, because she's an opportunist with no moral compass, she's flip-flopped on nearly everything."

Judge only by her actions! Yet Shapiro, for strictly political reasons, refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had. I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close. Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will.

I was happy to have played a part in his demise in that it all began on the evening of June 27, 2024, THE DEBATE, which I think was heavily pushed and promoted by Comrade Kamala Harris. She knew what was going to happen, and so did everyone else. It led to a first ever COUP of the President of the United States, who is now unhappily sunbathing on a Beach in California, watching the waves, and thinking how much he hates Barack Hussein Obama, Crazy Nancy Pelosi, and Lightweight Movie “Star” George Clooney, who failed to come to Crooked Joe’s defense. The good news is that I believe Joe Biden, the Worst President in the History of the United States, who served with the Worst Vice President in the History of the United States, is now seething. I don’t know why he gave up, I don’t know why he quit. He got 14 Million Votes, she got NONE. He’s an angry man now, and he should be!"
