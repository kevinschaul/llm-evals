As Christians, we are called to be a light in the darkness. The leadership coming from Washington is in a dark place. Under the Harris administration, free speech and religious liberty are under threat—parents at school board meetings labeled as domestic terrorists, children removed from families over gender reassignment objections, and legislation supporting abortion up to birth. Trump and Vance stand for protecting your First Amendment rights, empowering you to practice your faith freely and raise your children with the values you hold dear.",,openai/gpt-4o-mini,"

"The Interview on 60 Minutes with Comrade Kamala Harris is considered by many of those who reviewed it, the WORST Interview they have ever seen. She literally had no idea what she was talking about, and it was an embarrassment to our Country that a Major Party Candidate would be so completely inept. In addition, her Incompetence on “helping” people through the devastation of Hurricane Helene is being reviewed as, by far, the Worst in American History, even worse than Katrina - If that is possible! I can’t imagine anybody living in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, or Tennessee, voting for her. Pollsters are saying that the anti, or negative, Vote in those places, and even places not affected but with people watching what took place, will be heavily against her.

Trump: ""Under This Administration, 325,000 Migrant Children Are Missing,"" ""Many Of Them Are Sex Slaves""
Donald Trump accused Kamala Harris of ""facilitating he largest wave of sex trafficking and human trafficking in history"" by allowing cartels to operate on the U.S.-Mexico border at a press conference Friday in Los Angeles.


DONALD TRUMP: As attorney general, she defined ""child sex trafficking,"" ""assault with a deadly weapon,"" and ""rape of an unconscious person"" as nonviolent crimes. She put them in a new category, as ""nonviolent."" 

Now as vice president, she has facilitated the largest wave of sex trafficking and human trafficking in history - the history of our country by far. 

And in case you don't want to write about it, which you should because there can be no bigger scandal than this, we have, under this administration, 325,000 migrant children are missing. 325,000! In other words, take your biggest stadium in California and you can fill it up five or six times. Those are all missing children. Many of them are dead. Many of them are sex slaves, and slaves of a different nature. 

But her destruction of the law and order in California did not end there. In 2020, Kamala Harris probably endorsed ""defund the police."" We will defund the police. Anybody that was in favor of defunding the police for one month, let alone her entire career, should never be president of the United States. 

She supported a plan to cut the L.A. Police Department by at least $150 million, and ideally more. This is when your crime in L.A. was reaching very significant heights. Today it's at the highest level it has ever been.",,openai/gpt-4o-mini,"

The two so-called “Anchors” were a disgrace to Modern Day Journalism. David Muir should be ashamed of himself, as should Linsey Davis, who I never heard of, but both were nasty and rude when they were making statements that they knew were false. As an example, the FBI said they didn’t give all the information when coming up with Crime stats, making me RIGHT. Despite having to debate three people, Polls firmly state that I won, and EASILY. I felt that also, but no Politician should ever do a Debate with ABC News. They have proven NOT WORTHY, and hopefully an investigation will be done as to whether or not they gave the Debate questions to Comrade Kamala, whose best friend is a top ABC Executive.

Once ranked the most liberal Senator in the U.S. Senate, Harris has staked out extremely progressive positions on border security (or lack thereof), immigration, healthcare, fracking, education, energy, and more. And, because she's an opportunist with no moral compass, she's flip-flopped on nearly everything.",,openai/gpt-4o-mini,"

"Comrade Kamala Harris and her Department of Justice are trying to interfere in and suppress the Election in favor of the Democrats by resurrecting the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, and trying to say that Russia is trying to help me, which is absolutely FALSE. In fact, President Putin would much rather see Comrade Kamala Harris in Office, as he strongly said just this morning. Why aren’t they looking into Iran, China, & other Countries and, more importantly, why aren’t they looking at Marc Elias, Mark Pomerantz, the relationship between Lisa Monaco to Andrew Weissmann, CREW, and all of the other Enemies of the People that had such an effect on the 2020 Election, and are trying to Rig and Steal the 2024 Presidential Election. So ironic watching Lisa Monaco, a figurehead for Weissmann and the group of Radical Left Lunatics who had so much to do with the original Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, and now she is at it again, leading A.G.

In 2016, we did well, and WON. In 2020, we got Millions of more Votes and actually did much better than 2016, but nothing compares to this year, 2024. The Enthusiasm is GREAT, and the Management Team, headed up by Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, is THE BEST. Many people want to join the Campaign for the final push, some from the first two Campaigns - And we want as many as we can get! I am pleased to announce that Corey Lewandowski, who was very involved in 2016, will be coming on board as a Senior Advisor. Others, likewise, are joining us. They’ll be announced soon! Again, these 82 days will go down as the Most Important in Campaign History, and November 5th will be the Most Important Day in the History of our Country. We are a Nation in Decline, but we will soon be a Great Nation again! MAGA2024",,openai/gpt-4o-mini,"

In Texas last month, 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray was tied up, sexually assaulted, and strangled to death by two illegal aliens who Biden and Harris released into the United States.If Border Czar Harris stays in charge, every single week will bring a never-ending stream of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers, and child predators to go after our sons and daughters.",,openai/gpt-4o-mini,"

"P.M. Netanyahu of Israel had a terrible and “insulting” meeting in D.C. with Kamala Harris, who also refused to preside over Congress during his speech, which is an obligation of the V.P. Rarely has such a thing happened. Her ineptness will greatly prolong the war and delay the hostage release. The same people that embarrassed us in AFGHANISTAN with their gross incompetence, are the ones who are telling Israel not to fight any longer with Hamas. Forget October 7th, they say! Any Jewish person that votes for Kamala, or a Democrat, should immediately have their head examined. Likewise Catholics, who are being persecuted by this Administration, should not be voting for Radical Left Kamala. VOTE TRUMP 2024. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!",,openai/gpt-4o-mini,"

"I’ve never seen this before, but the producers of 60 Minutes sliced and diced (“cut and pasted”) Lyin’ Kamala’s answers to questions, which were virtually incoherent, over and over again, some by as many as four times in a single sentence or thought, all in an effort, possibly illegal as part of the “News Division,” which must be licensed, to make her look “more Presidential,” or a least, better.

"The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate, and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe’s, then Kamala’s, Political Opponent, ME, has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust. Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse! Allowing millions of people, from places unknown, to INVADE and take over our Country, is an unpardonable sin. OUR BORDERS MUST BE CLOSED, AND THE TERRORISTS, CRIMINALS, AND MENTALLY INSANE, IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM AMERICAN CITIES AND TOWNS, DEPORTED BACK TO THEIR COUNTIES OF ORIGIN.

Trump: ""Under This Administration, 325,000 Migrant Children Are Missing,"" ""Many Of Them Are Sex Slaves""
Donald Trump accused Kamala Harris of ""facilitating he largest wave of sex trafficking and human trafficking in history"" by allowing cartels to operate on the U.S.-Mexico border at a press conference Friday in Los Angeles.


DONALD TRUMP: As attorney general, she defined ""child sex trafficking,"" ""assault with a deadly weapon,"" and ""rape of an unconscious person"" as nonviolent crimes. She put them in a new category, as ""nonviolent."" 

Now as vice president, she has facilitated the largest wave of sex trafficking and human trafficking in history - the history of our country by far. 

And in case you don't want to write about it, which you should because there can be no bigger scandal than this, we have, under this administration, 325,000 migrant children are missing. 325,000! In other words, take your biggest stadium in California and you can fill it up five or six times. Those are all missing children. Many of them are dead. Many of them are sex slaves, and slaves of a different nature. 

But her destruction of the law and order in California did not end there. In 2020, Kamala Harris probably endorsed ""defund the police."" We will defund the police. Anybody that was in favor of defunding the police for one month, let alone her entire career, should never be president of the United States. 

She supported a plan to cut the L.A. Police Department by at least $150 million, and ideally more. This is when your crime in L.A. was reaching very significant heights. Today it's at the highest level it has ever been.",,openai/gpt-4o-mini,"

"We grieve the senseless death of the Israeli Hostages, horrifically including a wonderful American Citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, murdered by Hamas due to a complete lack of American Strength and Leadership. Make no mistake - This happened because Comrade Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe Biden are poor Leaders. Americans are getting slaughtered overseas, while Kamala is disparaging and making up lies about Gold Star families, and Biden is sleeping on the beach on this 16th consecutive day of vacation. They have blood on their hands! Sadly, this is the total lack of “Leadership” that Kamala and Biden represent - One that allows terrorists to take American lives, because they only care about Weaponizing the Department of Justice against their Political Opponent. Just like the Debacle of the Afghanistan Withdrawal that claimed 13 American lives, Kamala and Biden’s judgment has not only put lives at risk, but is directly responsible for unnecessary deaths that should have never happened….",,openai/gpt-4o-mini,"

"We had to turn away lots of people yesterday in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, but Comrade Kamala Harris’ Social Media Operation showed empty seats, long before the Rally started, early in the afternoon when, in actuality, we had to turn away 11,500 people! She’s a Crooked Radical Left Politician, and always will be! Everything she touches turns bad, just like California, and San Francisco before it - as is the case with all Marxists. She should have never been Vice President, and had to stage a COUP of Joe Biden, with her America-hating friends, Barrack Hussein Obama, Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, and the rest. Comrade Kamala is a STONE COLD LOSER, she will FAIL and, if she doesn’t, our Country will cease to exist as we know it, turning into a Communist, Crime Ridden Garbage Dump. November 5th will be the Most Important Date in the History of the U.S.A. It’s as simple as that!…",,openai/gpt-4o-mini,"

"Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she “A.I.’d” it, and showed a massive “crowd” of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST! She was turned in by a maintenance worker at the airport when he noticed the fake crowd picture, but there was nobody there, later confirmed by the reflection of the mirror like finish on the Vice Presidential Plane. She’s a CHEATER. She had NOBODY waiting, and the “crowd” looked like 10,000 people! Same thing is happening with her fake “crowds” at her speeches. This is the way the Democrats win Elections, by CHEATING - And they’re even worse at the Ballot Box. She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE.

The Debate was previously scheduled against Sleepy Joe Biden on ABC, but has been terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant, and I am in litigation against ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos, thereby creating a conflict of interest. The FoxNews Debate will be held in the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, at a site in an area to be determined.

"….As everyone knows, the Democrats have Unconstitutionally taken a Candidate, who was acknowledged to be defeated, and unceremoniously replaced him with a new Candidate. This has never been done before, and is a Threat to Democracy, but I am totally prepared to accept the results of this “coup,” and replace Joe on the Debate stage with Crazy Kamala Harris. I spent Hundreds of Millions of Dollars, Time, and Effort fighting Joe, and when I won the Debate, they threw a new Candidate into the ring. Not fair, but it is what it is! Nevertheless, different Candidate or not, their bad Policies are the same, and this will be strongly revealed at the September 4th Debate. I look forward to meeting and debating Kamala Harris on September 4th.

"P.M. Netanyahu of Israel had a terrible and “insulting” meeting in D.C. with Kamala Harris, who also refused to preside over Congress during his speech, which is an obligation of the V.P. Rarely has such a thing happened. Her ineptness will greatly prolong the war and delay the hostage release. The same people that embarrassed us in AFGHANISTAN with their gross incompetence, are the ones who are telling Israel not to fight any longer with Hamas. Forget October 7th, they say! Any Jewish person that votes for Kamala, or a Democrat, should immediately have their head examined.
