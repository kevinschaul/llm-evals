Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nCherry blossoms will be at peak March 28-31, Park Service says\nThe National Park Service predicted Thursday that D.C.\u2019s iconic cherry trees will reach peak bloom from March 28 to March 31.\nPeak bloom is declared by the agency when 70 percent of the blossoms around the Tidal Basin \u2014 the reservoir on the National Mall \u2014 have opened. Organizers expect 1.5 million people to visit the flowering trees during this year\u2019s National Cherry Blossom Festival.\nThe festival, which commemorates the 3,000 cherry trees Japan gifted to the United States as a symbol of friendship in 1912, will run from March 20 through April 13. The event \u2014 featuring an opening ceremony of Japanese performers, a parade along Constitution Avenue, live music at the Tidal Basin and a kite festival on the Washington Monument grounds \u2014 kicks off spring.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really one of <i>the</i> traditions of the nation\u2019s capital,\u201d said Mike Litterst, a spokesperson for the Park Service. \u201cIt\u2019s that sign that spring is finally here. It\u2019s sort of that one unifying thing that occurs in D.C. It\u2019s not blue, it\u2019s not red; for the few weeks that the trees are out, everybody is all about the pink.\u201d\nThis year marks the first cherry blossom season when construction will be underway to rehabilitate the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/dc-low-lying-city-flood-risks/\" target=\"_blank\">crumbling sea walls</a> around the Tidal Basin and West Potomac Park. The three-year renovation is part of a nearly $500 million project to improve infrastructure on the National Mall before the 250th anniversary of American independence in 2026.\nLitterst said visitors should expect construction between the Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt memorials, typically prime real estate for cherry blossom viewing.\n\u201cFolks will find fencing, they\u2019ll find screening in places, but all of the walkways are open, the roads are open and, most significantly, there will still be plenty of cherry trees in bloom,\u201d Litterst said.\nLast year, the Park Service <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/13/cherry-trees-cut-down-washington/\" target=_blank>removed 158 cherry trees</a> for the project \u2014 including the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/05/24/stumpy-removed-tidal-basin/\" target=_blank>much-loved Stumpy</a> \u2014 but Litterst said more than 2,500 trees remain around the Tidal Basin, with roughly 1,000 more on the Washington Monument grounds and in East Potomac Park.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Capital Weather Gang independently estimates peak bloom and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/02/26/dc-cherry-blossom-forecast-2025/\" target=_blank>predicted this year</a> that the blossoms will reach peak bloom between March 23 and 27, about five days earlier than normal.\nAccording to the Capital Weather Gang, climate change has spurred D.C.\u2019s iconic trees to flower earlier over time. The blossom\u2019s average peak has advanced about a week over the past century, from April 4 to March 29, with last year\u2019s March 17 peak bloom tying for the second-earliest on record. March 15, 1990, was the earliest record peak bloom.\nCity leaders, including D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, and National Cherry Blossom Festival organizers gathered at an annual news conference Thursday at the Waldorf Astoria in downtown D.C. to announce the peak bloom prediction.\nDiana Mayhew, president of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, credited the event for making D.C. \u201cthe springtime destination,\u201d in an interview ahead of the event. Last year, she said 1.6 million people \u2014 46 percent from the D.C. area and 54 percent tourists \u2014 flocked to the nation\u2019s capital to witness the beauty of the blossoms. The festival generated $202 million in visitor spending in D.C. last year, Mayhew said.\nCity leaders have hoped in recent years that the cherry blossoms could be a catalyst for tourism and reinvigorating the city\u2019s struggling downtown since the pandemic.\nBut Mayhew, who has organized the festival for 25 years, added that it\u2019s important to her that the celebration is not only for tourists. To \u201croll out the pink carpet for everyone,\u201d she said, festival organizers have launched community outreach programs and partnerships in all eight D.C. wards. Many of the initiatives focus on youths, including a program that sends local artists to lead workshops at D.C. schools and the \u201cKites in the Classroom\u201d program, which encourages elementary-schoolers to design, build and fly their own kites as an extension of the Blossom Kite Festival.\nOn Thursday, Mayhew also said the festival would include a new event to \u201cto keep Stumpy\u2019s spirit alive.\u201d The first Stumpy\u2019s Petals and Paddles boat race will take place on March 20 at the Tidal Basin.\n\u201cSpring is such a joyous time here in D.C.\u201d Mayhew said."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:30:25"}
