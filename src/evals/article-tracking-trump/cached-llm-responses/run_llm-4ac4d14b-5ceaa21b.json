{"args": ["openai/gpt-4.1-mini", "\nIs this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nDOGE rips through Education Department, cutting contracts, staff and grants\nThe notices popped into email boxes all over the country Monday afternoon, notifying researchers who collect, analyze and study data on the American education system that their contracts were terminated, effective immediately. No reason was given.\nThe nixed contracts support the Institute for Education Sciences at the Education Department, known as IES,<b> </b>and inside the agency, staff questioned whether the cuts were legal, much less justified.\nBut the decisions were not made by the institute\u2019s leaders or education experts. Rather, the canceled contracts were all on a list drawn up by a U.S. DOGE Service team that is working to unravel the Education Department, stripping the agency of staff, terminating contracts and \u2014 soon \u2014 canceling program grants, according to people familiar with DOGE activity who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re completely crippled,\u201d said one IES employee. \u201cIt really prevents us from serving the mission we thought we were carrying out.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump has made clear he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/\">wants the Education Department shuttered</a>. Absent congressional action to do that, his administration is at work dismantling it on its own.\nOn Wednesday, at least 50 recently hired employees who were on probation were abruptly dismissed without cause across the department, according to union leaders. Staff have been warned that layoffs are coming. And managers inside the agency have been instructed to identify workers who can be converted to a new job status that would strip them of some worker protections, according to a person with direct knowledge of the order.\nIn addition, DOGE caused about 100 Education Department employees to be put on administrative leave for their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/10/education-department-dei-devos/\">mostly tangential</a> connections to diversity, equity and inclusion<b> </b>programs, based on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/22/dei-federal-employees-trump/\">Trump\u2019s executive order</a> to rid the federal government of DEI offices and initiatives. And in <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/\">an executive order</a> Tuesday, Trump instructed departments heads across the government to hire no more than one employee for every four employees who depart, and to plan for mass layoffs.\n\u201cThe inmates are running the asylum, and the goal is chaos and the goal is destruction,\u201d Arne Duncan, who served as education secretary in the Obama administration, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this in our lifetime.\u201d\nOn Friday, the department announced another round of cancellations: $336 million in canceled contracts for Regional Educational Laboratories, which help states apply evidence-based practices to teaching and that <a href=\"https://www.the74million.org/article/from-covid-learning-loss-to-artificial-intelligence-education-rd-cant-wait/\" target=\"_blank\">have been praised</a> by the former Tennessee schools chief who Trump nominated as deputy secretary of education.\nThe cancellation of contracts began at IES, but is expected to extend to other parts of the department. A department spokeswoman, Madi Biedermann, said earlier this week that 89 contracts worth nearly $900 million had been canceled at IES \u2014 not counting the new crop canceled on Friday.\nOther officials said the total number was 167 or 169. It\u2019s not clear what accounted for the discrepancy. IES has a small full-time staff; most of its work is<b> </b>contracted out.\nIt\u2019s also not clear<b> </b>whether the savings are as deep as the<b> </b>department said.\nNat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, pulled data on the canceled contracts that suggested DOGE overstated the cost of some of them. He also found that, in many cases, contractors are already several years into their agreements, so a lot of the money has been spent already. His preliminary calculations show that the actual savings may be half as much as DOGE claims, or less.\nMalkus\u2019s concern is that agreements were canceled without careful consideration, and for less of a benefit than advertised.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bloat in IES. There\u2019s a lot of problems to be solved,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are problems you solve with a scalpel and maybe a hatchet, but not a bulldozer.\u201d\n\u2018Complete confusion\u2019\nThe \u201cbulldozer\u201d arrived at IES on Monday, when a young representative of DOGE delivered the list of contracts to be terminated to the department\u2019s acting director. Soon after, a flurry of emergency meetings began, first with managers and then with rank-and-file employees, announcing that the contracts were being canceled, effective immediately.\nThere were no reasons given for the cuts, attendees said, except that DOGE wanted them. The mood was somber, with some holding back tears, staffers said. Confused IES employees asked repeatedly about the legality of DOGE\u2019s actions, but they didn\u2019t get an answer.\nMeantime, on the outside, texts, emails and calls were bouncing among researchers and contractors as word spread of canceled contracts. The feeling was utter shock and \u201ccomplete confusion,\u201d said Rachel Dinkes, president and CEO of Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education research groups.\nInside and outside the department, those close to IES research said they<b> </b>were unsettled by the youth and inexperience of DOGE representatives recommending the cancellations, as well as what seemed to be a lack of understanding of the complex, interdependent ecosystem of contracts maintained by IES.\nFor instance, one canceled contract was for work on the Common Core of Data, the primary database of all K-12 schools in the United States. It includes data on enrollment, demographics and other information about students and teachers, and is used by researchers, government agencies and others for a wide range of reasons. It is, said Dinkes, the \u201cbackbone\u201d of knowledge about American education and needed for virtually any effort to compare and analyze schools.\nContracts for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/01/29/nations-report-card-naep-test-scores-fall/\">National Assessment of Educational Progress</a>, or NAEP, exams were not canceled. But Dinkes and others said that NAEP relies on the Common Core of Data when it creates the sample<b> </b>of schools to administer tests. So running the testing program, sometimes called the Nation\u2019s Report Card, will be harder without the Common Core of Data, she said.\nIn another example, DOGE killed a contract for interpreting data IES collects from colleges and universities tracking enrollment and financial aid. The raw data will still be gathered, but the studies that made sense of it for the public are gone. That will make it harder to understand how students are using financial aid, staffers said, and to identify barriers to higher education.\n\u201cSure, you have the raw data that scientists can fiddle with, but the necessary step of digesting that in ways that answer questions, it\u2019s gone,\u201d a staffer said. \u201cNow you need a PhD to make any sense of it.\u201d\nDOGE also canceled contracts IES maintained to publish practice guides for students and schools on topics including how to prepare for college, how to succeed in high school, how to become literate in STEM \u2014 and, for educators, how to solve attendance problems. The guides were the most popular product IES publishes, staffers said.\n\nIn other cases, contracts were for programs that are designed to test the most effective way to solve a problem within the education system. For instance, one contractor was running a study looking at how best to accelerate math learning, Dinkes said. She said the study involved giving half of a group of students<b> </b>one type of instruction and the other half another. The goal was to see which teaching method produced better math results.\nBut the experiment was abruptly terminated this week when the contract was canceled, she said, and the students are no longer getting either of the math interventions.\nBefore the cuts, some employees tried to lay out these complexities for DOGE representatives, a staffer said. Some contracts were expendable, they suggested, but others were not. But the employees were unable to sway DOGE team.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve effectively dismantled us,\u201d said one staffer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re completely crippled,\u201d said another.\nIn addition, many of the canceled contracts were nearing the end of multiyear projects, so terminating them meant time, effort and money already expended may go to waste.\n\u201cCanceling them now yields the taxpayers no return on their investment,\u201d said a statement from American Institutes for Research, which had 15 IES contracts worth more than $180 million, according to DOGE\u2019s list, which was obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cThis is an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\nBiedermann, the department spokeswoman, said the contracts were costing more than they were worth. But she said she didn\u2019t know<b> </b>how or why DOGE reached that conclusion. \u201cThe significant amount of money as compared to the outcomes generated for students is not commensurate,\u201d she said.\nAsked how DOGE workers have the requisite expertise to make these determinations, she said, \u201cThe entire goal of DOGE is to cut waste, and they have been trained to identify that.\u201d\nContracts that can be justified or that are congressionally mandated will be rebid, which can be a lengthy process, officials said.\nThe cancellations hung over the confirmation hearing Thursday for Linda McMahon, Trump\u2019s nominee for Education secretary, with several Democrat senators pressing her on what was going on inside the agency.\nSen. Edward J. Markey (D-Massachusetts) said DOGE rightfully stands for the \u201cDepartment of Gutting Education.\u201d\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s just a down payment to gut the education of every public school student in America,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst they announce the cuts. Then they go to find where it is. So it\u2019s all backwards.\u201d\nGrants on the chopping block\nStaff at the Education Department<b> </b>are now bracing for the next round of cuts, they said, including more grant cancellations.\nMost of the money that Education sends to schools is distributed by a formula, but more than $7 billion is given through competitive grant programs, such as one that pays for after school programs and another that supports charter schools.\nLast week, staffers were directed to review all grants that have \u201cillegal DEI in them,\u201d another employee said. On Monday, a DOGE account on X <a href=\"https://x.com/DOGE/status/1889105335991820585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1889105335991820585%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc\">said</a> that it had terminated 29 \u201cDEI training grants\u201d at the Education Department totaling $101 million.\nAlso on Monday, DOGE was given access to scour a database detailing all the department\u2019s grants, said one person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private proceedings. \u201cGrants will be [canceled] this week or early next,\u201d the person predicted.\nThen, on Friday, the department announced it was terminating $33 million in grants for Equity Assistance Centers, a program created to support school desegregation but that the department said supports \u201cdivisive training.\u201d\nThe DOGE team has also gained access to sensitive department data, including the personal information of millions of borrowers who\u2019ve taken out federal student loans. That\u2019s led to a 30-fold increase in complaints<b> </b>to a privacy office at the department, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nDuncan, the former education secretary, said DOGE workers have no qualifications and no legal right to access Americans\u2019 personal data. More important, he said, they have the wrong goals.\n\u201cAll this sound and noise and drama and not one word about helping more kids learn to read,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even a mention.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:58:01"}
