Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nArab leaders scramble for alternative to Trump\u2019s Gaza proposal\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s plan to remove Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and create a real estate \u201criviera\u201d on the eastern Mediterranean has spurred a regional scramble for an alternative, with Arab leaders working on a proposal that aims to pump billions of dollars in reconstruction money into the enclave, according to people familiar with the planning.\nLeaders from Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar met in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Friday to thrash out details less than three weeks after Trump laid out a plan <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/trump-netanyahu-meeting/\" target=_blank>for the United States to \u201ctake over\u201d Gaza</a> and displace the population there, a proposal that has been broadly condemned as tantamount to ethnic cleansing.\nThe emerging Arab plan would call for Palestinian technocrats to govern Gaza and the provision of substantial funds to rebuild the shattered enclave, where the vast majority of the population of 2 million has been left homeless, according to five people with knowledge of the discussions.\nAnd while details of the plan are still being hashed out, they say there is resounding unanimity on one issue: Palestinians should not be displaced.\n\u201cThe Trump proposal is so outlandish and offensive to many in the Middle East that certainly it\u2019s a nonstarter. It\u2019s a hot mess,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), who has discussed plans with regional leaders including Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, whom Blumenthal met in the Jordanian Red Sea resort of Aqaba this week.\n\u201cThe Arab plan will seek to present a realistic proposal for reconstruction in Gaza without forced evacuation and without a United States takeover,\u201d Blumenthal said in a telephone interview.\nThe broad strokes of the Arab plan \u2014 hoped to be<b> </b>finalized ahead of an emergency summit with representatives of the broader 22-member Arab League on March 4 \u2014 are \u201cbecoming clearer,\u201d Blumenthal said. But significant hurdles remain, including reaching Arab consensus and<b> </b>obtaining U.S. and Israeli buy-in, he added.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel is \u201ccommitted\u201d to Trump\u2019s plan and described it as a \u201cbold vision\u201d for Gaza. The proposal has also received rapturous approval from the country\u2019s far-right politicians, who have pushed for Israeli settlements in Gaza and the enclave\u2019s annexation.\nBut Arab states are hoping to garner backing for their plan with their checkbooks. A new assessment by the United Nations estimates that it could cost $50 billion to rebuild Gaza after the devastation caused by 15 months of war.\nThe exact figure to be put forward is \u201cstill up for review,\u201d but the proposal is likely to include a headline number, said Emirati academic Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a visiting fellow at Harvard University.\n\u201cThe number is important because they know the president of the United States is transactional, he likes numbers, and they think he might be swayed when he sees these billions of dollars,\u201d including construction opportunities for U.S. companies,<b> </b>he said.\nEgyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said this week that regional construction firms, including those in Egypt, have the capacity to build 300,000 housing units over a three-year period.\nOther proposals being considered appear aimed at keeping Trump\u2019s interest in investment at the heart of Gaza\u2019s future. One, from the Al Habtoor Group, an Emirati conglomerate, <a href=\"https://www.alhabtoorgroup.com/gaza/Gaza-Reconstruction-Plan.pdf\" target=_blank>outlines a phased approach</a> that would establish security in the territory and transition emergency housing into redevelopment over 18 months.\nArab countries know they hold leverage by being \u201cthe ATMs\u201d for reconstruction, said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. However, the \u201cclash of worldviews,\u201d between Israel and Trump on one side and the region on the other, remains a major sticking point, he said.\nDuring his trip to Washington this month, Netanyahu looked on smiling as Trump outlined his plans for a U.S. \u201ctakeover\u201d of Gaza. \u201cThe big impediment is if the whole exercise will be accepted by Trump, and certainly big questions over whether it will be accepted by the current Israeli government,\u201d Katulis said of the Arab plan.\nPhase one of the Arab plan envisages reconstruction in areas that have not been completely obliterated, but Arab leaders are willing to open their wallets only if other political and security elements of a plan are put in place, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who has recently met with ministers from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan to discuss evolving plans. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balancing act because all these three pieces need to converge,\u201d he said.\nThe technocratic committee envisioned for Gaza under the Arab plan would not include Hamas, the ruler of Gaza for almost two decades and architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\u201cThe two main driving principles on the governance side is that Hamas will have no governing role in Gaza, and also that it creates a political unity with the West Bank,\u201d said Van Hollen, adding that Arab states want the Palestinian Authority, the governing entity in the West Bank, to have some degree of sign-off on the structure.\nArab leaders, like previous U.S. administrations, have long advocated a clear path to a two-state solution, which Netanyahu has repeatedly opposed, along with any rule by the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.\n\u201cSquaring that circle is a big challenge at this point,\u201d Van Hollen said.\nTwo officials briefed on the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive proposals that are still in flux, emphasized that the technocratic government is intended to be a \u201ctemporary\u201d body to oversee rebuilding and would remain in place only until elections could be held.\nWhile many officials in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, and in Riyadh remain frustrated that they were not informed before Trump floated the Gaza displacement plan, they also acknowledge that the U.S. leader\u2019s approach has succeeded in motivating the Arab states to act, according to the officials.\n\u201cTrump scrambled the table, and it forced other people to start doing some of the heavy lifting,\u201d said one individual familiar with the thinking of the regional leadership. Others in the region draw parallels to Trump\u2019s comments on Ukraine that spurred emergency meetings of leaders in Europe.\nBut Van Hollen said he also fears that Trump\u2019s plan has set back the chances of making a deal. \u201cIn addition to being outrageous on its face, it\u2019s further emboldened the far right and made it more difficult to achieve an overall settlement,\u201d he said.\nHamas\u2019s objections are another potential spoiler to any plan, as is the thorny question of who will provide security in Gaza. Hamas still holds weapons stockpiles, while the security vacuum has led to a rise in criminal gangs.\n\u201cThere is still a very challenging and complicated road ahead, even if Arab leaders present a realistic plan,\u201d said Blumenthal, adding that Abdullah has been \u201cvery clear-eyed and realistic\u201d in his thinking.\nBut while the gaps remain wide, both Trump and Netanyahu want a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and also to maintain a regional coalition against Iran as Israel mulls <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/12/israel-iran-us-intelligence/\" target=_blank>strikes against Tehran\u2019s nuclear program</a>.\n\u201cThere is a golden opportunity for Israel to integrate with the region and recognize its wildest dreams,\u201d said Katulis.\nWhile Trump\u2019s initial proposal to empty Gaza of its inhabitants sparked anger in Saudi Arabia, the close ties between the two powers were on full display this week.\nTrump made an appearance at a Saudi investment summit in Miami after tapping Riyadh to host talks to end the war in Ukraine. The coverage in Saudi media was glowing. Saudi Arabia \u201chas achieved success on all fronts,\u201d proclaimed a column in Asharq al-Awsat by Tariq Alhomayed, the newspaper\u2019s former editor.\nSpeaking at the summit in Miami on Thursday, Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, addressed Gaza and appeared to dial back elements of the president\u2019s plan that had caused alarm, saying some of Trump\u2019s comments had been misconstrued.\nThe level of destruction is so great, a five-year development plan \u201cis not physically possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we are on an eviction plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means the president wants to shake up everybody\u2019s thinking.\u201d\nWitkoff said Arab leaders are now considering new solutions for rebuilding Gaza, ideas that \u201cpeople would have never considered, and I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n<i>Abigail Hauslohner in Washington contributed to this report.</i>"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 09:34:26"}
