Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nCollege enrollment rebounds, surpassing pre-pandemic levels\nStudent head counts at the nation\u2019s colleges and universities has rebounded, according to a new national report, with total enrollment numbers higher than in fall 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic disrupted higher education.\nThe <a href=\"https://nscresearchcenter.org/current-term-enrollment-estimates/\">report</a> from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, released Thursday, found undergraduate enrollment neared 16 million in fall 2024, while graduate enrollment climbed to 3.2 million. All told, total enrollment was up 4.5 percent in the fall compared with the previous year.\nThursday\u2019s report arrives a week after the Clearinghouse said a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/01/14/college-freshman-enrollment-increase-data-error/\">\u201cmethodological error\u201d</a> skewed its preliminary calculation of the number of first-year students who enrolled in fall 2024. The center initially said freshman enrollment dropped 5 percent, but later discovered that some college freshmen were incorrectly labeled as dual-enrolled in high school and college classes.\nThe Clearinghouse has been a trusted source for enrollment trends in higher education because it collects information from 97 percent of the 3,600 degree-granting institutions in the country. The center produces enrollment data sooner than the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/timing-of-ipeds-data-collection#:~:text=Provisional%20data%20are%20first%20released,year%20for%20some%20survey%20components).\">Education Department</a>, which typically has a nearly year-long time lag.\nSome observers questioned why it took the center months to identify its error, especially when previous reports indicated a nascent rebound in higher-education enrollment.\n\u201cOur sensitivity to abnormally large changes was somewhat reduced because we had a host of ready explanations for why we might be seeing these declines,\u201d Doug Shapiro, the research center\u2019s executive director, said on a call with reporters Wednesday. \u201cIt would have surprised us in a normal year, but in the year in which we had issues with the FAFSA, changes in the economy \u2026 and all other kinds of things that could be driving a change like that, kind of dulled our sensors.\u201d\nThe preliminary report the Clearinghouse released in October relied on reporting from half of colleges and universities that submit data to the center. Thursday\u2019s report, however, is based on the vast majority of colleges and uses a different methodology to determine freshman enrollment.\nAccording to the final fall numbers, freshman head counts grew 5.5 percent, driven by the enrollment of students over age 21. The number of 18-year-olds heading to college also climbed by 3.4 percent but is still below pre-pandemic levels. Traditional-age freshmen grew at the highest rates among students from low-income neighborhoods, particularly at community colleges.\n\u201cWe saw larger declines initially among low-income students during the pandemic, so some of this may be a return to normal,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cBut it is hard to speculate what\u2019s driving that difference.\u201d\nCommunity colleges, which bore the brunt of enrollment losses during the pandemic, are now reporting some of the strongest enrollment gains, although they remain below pre-pandemic levels. Those with a focus on vocational education witnessed double-digit growth for the second year in a row. Students are also flocking to certificate programs, where enrollments are now 28.5 percent above 2019 levels, according to the Clearinghouse.\nEnrollment in bachelor\u2019s and associate\u2019s degree programs is also up, by 2.9 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively, but these remain below 2019 levels. Student head counts are up across all regions, with the Northeast recording the first gain in enrollment since before the pandemic."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 10:53:47"}
