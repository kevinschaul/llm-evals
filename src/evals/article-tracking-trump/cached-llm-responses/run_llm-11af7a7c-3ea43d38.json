{"args": ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "\nIs this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nJudge allows intelligence agencies to fire officers in DEI roles\nA federal judge on Thursday refused to stop the CIA and director of national intelligence from firing 51 officers who had been assigned to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility roles that were scrapped last month by President Donald Trump. The officers may not appeal to civil service boards, and they may not transfer to other jobs in the intelligence community because agency rules allow the director to fire employees without any recourse.\nIn three court hearings this month, U.S. District Judge Anthony J. Trenga questioned why the Trump administration decided to fire all of the officials instead of reassigning them, as had been recommended by career-services officials at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\u201cThese are talented, experienced assets, if you will, that would be in the interests of the United States to be reassigned elsewhere, if that need existed,\u201d Trenga said at a hearing Monday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.\nBut government lawyers said CIA Director John Ratcliffe relied on a regulation particular to the intelligence community stating that \u201cany employee may be terminated from the Agency at any time without regard to any procedural steps \u2026 when the [director], in his discretion, deems it necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States.\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Dennis Barghaan said that prevented the employees from being reassigned.\nKevin T. Carroll, a lawyer for the fired officers, argued that \u201cin the interest of the United States\u201d meant that the employee was being fired for reasons related to national security, and that there should be individualized findings before anyone is released. But Trenga said the court didn\u2019t have jurisdiction over an administrative claim unless the agency waived its sovereign immunity, and that the officers probably wouldn\u2019t prevail on the issues that their First Amendment right to free speech and their Fifth Amendment right to due process were violated.\n\u201cIn effect, they are at-will employees,\u201d the judge ruled. \u201cThe regulations make it clear they have no property interest in the employment they have.\u201d\nAs the disappointed officers looked on, Carroll said afterward: \u201cWe respect the court\u2019s decision. I would certainly hope, given the judge\u2019s remarks, that Director Ratcliffe would consider allowing the plaintiffs to apply for other jobs.\u201d He said one of the fired officers had eight other job offers within the CIA, as a data scientist, but was prevented from accepting one.\nThe lawsuit was filed by 19 anonymous intelligence officers who said they had been temporarily assigned to DEI roles within their agencies and were now being scapegoated \u201cin the service of a partisan ideological agenda.\u201d Some of the employees have been on the job for two decades, according to court records. Ten of the employees were in court for Thursday\u2019s ruling, but declined to comment afterward.\nEarlier, Carroll said the career intelligence officers had been trained at taxpayers\u2019 expense to perform some of the most sensitive spy jobs \u2014 \u201cfrom source development to recruitment\u201d and \u201ccollection to analysis\u201d \u2014 and that they were being fired despite being qualified for other open positions at their agencies. Some stand to lose the government pensions they had been working toward for years, the lawyer said.\n\u201cNone of these officers\u2019 activities was or is illegal, and at no time have the agencies employing Plaintiffs contended that they individually engaged in any misconduct, nor are they accused of poor performance,\u201d Carroll said in a legal filing. Their job duties included \u201cadvancing the hiring, promotion and advancement of members of protected classes,\u201d and firing them for performing assigned work would violate their constitutional rights, he said.\nAccording to court records, the officers were placed on administrative leave with pay two days after Trump signed an executive order last month terminating all DEI programs in the executive branch. Weeks later, some of the officers were told to report to their agencies\u2019 visitor centers with their badges and without lawyers. That\u2019s what it looks like when an intelligence community member is about to get fired or placed on leave without pay, one of the anonymous CIA officers said in a court filing.\nThe intelligence officer defended the need for diversity among the agency\u2019s ranks. Blending in \u201cracially and culturally\u201d among foreign populations is key to intelligence collection, he said. \u201cThere are needs for dual citizenship documentation, foreign language skills and/or overseas living experiences,\u201d the officer said, noting that in some cultural settings, women will not meet alone with men.\nJustice Department attorneys said in a legal filing that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard had not finalized any plans to fire officers in DEI roles. But Gabbard and Ratcliffe have unqualified authority to fire any of their employees, and Ratcliffe has chosen to use it, the attorneys argued.\nRatcliffe in a court filing said he could terminate any CIA employee under provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, \u201cwhen, in my discretion, I deem it \u2018necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.\u2019 \u201d Shutting down the CIA\u2019s diversity and inclusion office and firing all its employees met that standard, he said.\nThe DEI-related firings could affect not just the 19 intelligence officers who sued but a total of 51 employees at the CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence, their attorneys said. At the CIA, they said, the mass ouster \u201csuggests an unlawful effort \u2026 to misuse the Director\u2019s unique national security-related authorities to evade federal equal opportunity laws.\u201d\nTrenga said he was puzzled by the CIA\u2019s decision not to reassign the officers. Agency regulations state that any employees who are terminated as part of a downsizing should be offered open positions, he said. Justice Department attorneys said Ratcliffe fired the employees under a different regulation that provides no such job protections.\n\u201cI frankly don\u2019t quite understand why that\u2019s being resisted by the agency,\u201d the judge said at the hearing Monday. Trenga was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush and presides over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in addition to serving as a federal district court judge in Virginia.\nAttorneys for the CIA officers said the agency\u2019s career service has identified at least one suitable open position for each of them.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:06:45"}
