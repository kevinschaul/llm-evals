Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump\u2019s Mideast envoy tries to explain what president was talking about\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, deployed to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to help back away from Trump\u2019s Tuesday night proposal to seize control of the Gaza Strip and displace its population after some Republicans raised objections about a new U.S. military occupation overseas.\n\u201cWitkoff said that the president doesn\u2019t want to put any troops in Gaza and that he doesn\u2019t want to spend any U.S. money on Gaza,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) said after Witkoff delivered a presentation to Senate Republicans over a private lunch meeting. \u201cWhich is good,\u201d Hawley added. \u201cSo maybe, I might have misunderstood the president last night.\u201d\nBut Witkoff did not suggest that Trump had abandoned his proposal that Gaza\u2019s population of 2.2 million Palestinians be displaced.\nWitkoff \u201cpainted a scenario of a Gazan family moving back into tents, thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to get back into a dwelling in five years,\u2019 and that is just not going to happen. It is a wasteland of rubble,\u201d said one senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe Witkoff\u2019s private presentation. Arab states \u2014 who have so far reacted in anger to Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 would have to take the Palestinians, Witkoff told them.\nHow? Money. The senator said other Arab governments could be enticed with the offer of treaties and deals that would provide \u201chundreds of billions of dollars to their economy\u201d in exchange for resettling the Palestinians.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me the administration believes there\u2019s a win-win situation with some Arab countries, where it would become so financially attractive to them to accept these displaced Gazans,\u201d the senator said. \u201cThere are reconstruction and construction and development projects that are not eligible for adequate insurance under the current constraints that Saudi Arabia has, for example, that would be lifted if certain agreements could be made or consummated.\u201d\nHawley said that one senator asked Witkoff if perhaps Trump was just speaking off the cuff, tossing out ideas as they came to him, as he sometimes does.\nWitkoff assured them it wasn\u2019t that either \u2014 Trump has been \u201cgestating on this plan for some time,\u201d Hawley said, describing the exchange. He didn\u2019t provide many further details on what the plan was though.\n\u201cWhen you find out, would you let me know?\u201d Hawley said.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:00:32"}
