Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nPentagon to fire 5,400 civilian employees in \u2018initial\u2019 purge\nThe Pentagon said Friday that it will fire about 5,400 civilian employees beginning next week in an \u201cinitial\u201d purge of its workforce, as President Donald Trump\u2019s hastily issued orders to shake up the Defense Department faced new scrutiny and officials scrambled to understand whether such actions could imperil national security.\nThe announcement followed a day of uncertainty, as administration officials paused a plan to begin firings now while evaluating requests to retain thousands of other employees deemed essential. A senior Pentagon official, Darin Selnick, said in a statement late Friday that the Trump administration intends to cull its workforce by between 5 and 8 percent. With more than 900,000 civilian employees in the Defense Department, tens of thousands of people could be forced out eventually.\nEchoing <a href=\"https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1892702578418327972\" target=_blank>a pronouncement</a> made earlier by Trump\u2019s defense secretary,<b> </b>Pete Hegseth, Selnick said in his statement that \u201cit is simply not in the public interest to retain individuals whose contributions are not mission-critical.\u201d\n\u201cTaxpayers deserve to have us take a thorough look at our workforce top-to-bottom to see where we can eliminate redundancies,\u201d Selnick added. The cuts are necessary, he said, \u201cto produce efficiencies and refocus\u201d the Pentagon on Trump\u2019s national security priorities.\nThe firings are not expected to target U.S. troops. The Pentagon oversees about 1.3 million active-duty service members and nearly 800,000 more who are in the National Guard and reserves.\nThe cuts will come after Trump administration officials, coordinating with billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s U.S. DOGE Service, have slashed thousands of employees elsewhere in the government as part of the president\u2019s broad effort to dismantle the federal bureaucracy.\nThe Defense Department\u2019s civilian worker purge is beginning with probationary employees, those who have one to three years of experience or who recently were promoted, according to officials familiar with the matter, who like some others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue\u2019s sensitivity. That pool of people numbers between 50,000 and 55,000, officials said.\nAfter deliberations over the last day, the Pentagon has settled on firing about 10 percent of its probational employees, a defense official familiar with the effort said. A hiring freeze is expected to take hold next week, and administration officials plan to spend two to three months analyzing who else could be ousted, the official said.\nSupervisors throughout the department, the federal government\u2019s largest, have spent days requesting of the new administration that certain employees should be spared because the work they do is vital to national defense. An email obtained by The Washington Post indicates that Trump officials ultimately decided they need more time to sort through those many cases.\nThe message, sent Thursday night by Ruth Vetter, a lawyer in the Pentagon general counsel\u2019s office, said that senior officials had informed human resources staff that \u201cthey should not initiate removals of probationary employees\u201d on Friday because requests for exemptions citing mission criticality \u201care still under review.\u201d\nVetter\u2019s email, labeled \u201cPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL,\u201d warned that an employee\u2019s past performance \u201cmust be viewed through the current needs and best interest of the government, in light of the President\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\u201d\nVetter referred questions to Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot, who did not respond to requests for comment.\nAmong the agency\u2019s probationary employees are hundreds of teachers who work for the Department of Defense Education Activity, a school system that educates about 67,000 students \u2014 mostly the children of service members \u2014 at military installations around the globe. One person familiar with the matter said that DoDEA officials were attempting to save teachers from Trump\u2019s purge of the federal workforce, but it was unclear if the effort would be successful. A DoDEA spokesman declined to comment.\nAt the Office of Naval Intelligence, which provides senior military officials with maritime threat assessments and related analysis, employees were called to a meeting Thursday at their headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, where they were told that all probationary workers would be terminated, said one intelligence analyst.\nThe analyst went to work Friday expecting to be out of a job, but was informed that no further instructions had been received. \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up too much,\u201d he said he was told.\nThe analyst, an Air Force veteran, said about 60 people in his office could be fired, and voiced frustration that he and his colleagues are seen by DOGE officials as numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\u201cWork is next to impossible right now,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cMorale is through the floor.\u201d\nCoinciding with the civilian-worker purge, U.S. defense officials, acting on orders from Hegseth, have undertaken a sprawling effort to compile options for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/19/trump-pentagon-budget-cuts/\" target=_blank>slashing about 8 percent</a> from each armed service\u2019s budget for each of the next five years. Doing so, Hegseth has said, could yield $50 billion in 2026 to be reinvested elsewhere in the Defense Department, including an expensive missile-defense shield that Trump has taken to calling \u201cIron Dome For America.\u201d\nAfter news of Hegseth\u2019s directive alarmed lawmakers and defense officials, the former Fox News personality sought to blame the news media for causing confusion about the administration\u2019s efforts and portrayed his plan as a \u201creorienting\u201d of the Pentagon budget away from \u201cwoke, Biden-era nonlethal programs\u201d to \u201cinstead spend that money on President Trump\u2019s America First, peace-through-strength priorities for our national budget.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a cut,\u201d Hegseth said in a nearly <a href=\"https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1892702578418327972\" target=_blank>nine-minute video</a> posted to social media on Thursday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s refocusing and reinvesting existing funds into building a force to protect you, the American people.\u201d\nBut independent budget analysts said it is highly unlikely that tens of billions of dollars per year can be targeted for reinvestment without slashing some major weapons programs and cutting the number troops in some of the services.\nTravis Sharp, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the fiscal 2025 budget under President Joe Biden included $162 million for diversity, equity and inclusion programs and $3.6 billion to build resiliency at Defense Department installations to counter climate change. Even if all of that money is removed from the budget and reprogrammed, he said, it\u2019s a \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d at getting to $50 billion.\nTo achieve such an ambitious goal, Sharp said, the Pentagon could retire older weapons programs, eliminate newer ones that remain in development, and shrink or shutter individual headquarters and agencies. Similar efforts have been undertaken before, Sharp said, including by Defense Secretary Robert Gates under President Barack Obama, but they still fell well short of Hegseth\u2019s goals.\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re attempting is unprecedented in recent history,\u201d Sharp said.\nMackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said it will take an \u201call of the above\u201d approach to cut that deeply into existing defense budget to fund new efforts. She noted that in a memo to senior Pentagon officials on Tuesday, Hegseth \u201cwalled off\u201d 17 key priorities identified by the Trump administration \u2014 including missile defense, submarines, one-way attack drones and border security. So other areas will be especially vulnerable.\n\u201cLook, the Defense Department reflects America,\u201d she said. \u201cThe largest line item on the balance sheet of most corporations is labor. It\u2019s people. There\u2019s no workforce you can spare. They\u2019re going to have to go after the defense civilian workforce as well as active-duty military end strength.\u201d\nAnother option the Trump administration could pursue, especially if it seeks to slash billions of dollars in future years for new priorities, is the closure of some existing military bases, Eaglen said. Such efforts \u2014 commonly known as base realignment and closure \u2014 have been politically unpopular, but could be appealing to Musk, she predicted.\n\u201cThere is a very compelling case for base closure,\u201d Eaglen said. \u201cIf you kind of get into those weeds with people, you can make a rational business case. I actually think Congress could be compelled with a bully [defense secretary] and bully White House.\u201d\n<i>Warren P.
