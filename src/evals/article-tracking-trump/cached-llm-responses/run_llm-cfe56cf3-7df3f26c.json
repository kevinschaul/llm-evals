Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nMedical evacuations from Gaza slow amid uncertainty over right of return\nDOHA, Qatar \u2014 For many Palestinians with critical injuries or chronic illnesses, a medical evacuation out of the Gaza Strip is the only way to access lifesaving care. But now, after President Donald Trump proposed to empty Gaza of its inhabitants, aid workers and doctors say they fear that those leaving the territory could be forfeiting their ability to one day return home.\nInside Gaza, the evacuations have slowed for a range of reasons, including this uncertainty and tightened security checks, according to doctors and aid workers. At the same time, fewer countries are accepting evacuees, a development that aid workers say could partially be a result of fatigue more than a year into the crisis but that also reflects the growing fear that those who leave will not be allowed to return.\nAll of this means a longer wait for families with injured loved ones. But doctors who have worked in Gaza\u2019s hospitals say many of the people awaiting medical evacuations don\u2019t have time.\nAmira Nimerawi, an advocate and aid worker with Health Workers for Palestine, said she\u2019s struggled, knowing that some of the people she has helped to leave Gaza may not be able to go back. \u201cBoth personally and professionally, it is an uncomfortable position and infuriating,\u201d she said.\nBut as a humanitarian worker, she said, her priority will always be delivering lifesaving aid. \u201cHow many more children or other people are we going to lose from preventable conditions? There\u2019s a huge number of people who have died because of lack of access,\u201d she said.\nSince war between Israel and Hamas broke out in October 2023, the need for medical care outside Gaza has ballooned. The World Health Organization says 25,000 people in Gaza are in need of medical evacuation, including 2,500 children who need urgent attention for war wounds and for chronic diseases like cancer that cannot be treated in the territory.\nDuring the early months of the war, medical evacuations happened regularly. Between November 2023 and May 2024, some 4,900 wounded or critically ill people were transported out of Gaza for treatment in neighboring Egypt and farther afield in the Persian Gulf, Europe and even the United States. But since then, thousands of severely wounded and chronically ill Palestinians have been trapped inside Gaza after its Rafah border crossing with Egypt was shut by Israeli military operations eight months ago.\nQatar, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have accepted the vast majority of injured and sick Gazans since the war began. About 2,300 patients and family members are in Abu Dhabi, and some 2,500 people are in Doha, according to foreign ministry tallies. Tens of thousands of Gazans have crossed into Egypt since the fighting erupted, many but not all seeking medical treatment. Last week, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II pledged that his country would accept 2,000 sick children from Gaza, but it is unclear when those evacuations will occur.\nMimi Syed, an emergency medicine doctor, treated some of the children who are now waiting for medical evacuations from Gaza. She said many of them need repeated surgeries as they recover from gunshot wounds, severe burns or amputations, procedures that would be considered \u201csimple\u201d at the hospital where she practices in Washington state.\n\u201cMany of these kids are kids who, if they lived in the United States, would be able to lead normal lives,\u201d she said. But, she said, because of the lack of medical facilities and the high risk of infection in Gaza, delayed treatment \u201cis a death sentence.\u201d\nInitially, the ceasefire reached last month between Israel and Hamas gave doctors like Syed hope that medical evacuations would ramp up. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Rafah was to be reopened for medical evacuations, starting with 50 patients a day plus their caregivers.\nBut evacuations have been bedeviled by several issues. Tightened security checks by Israel and Egypt, and strict rules governing who can accompany the wounded as caregivers, have slowed the issuing of permits to depart Gaza. And citing overwhelmed medical facilities, Egyptian authorities have limited the number of people they are willing to take. Aid workers and doctors say that on most days there are fewer than 50 patients evacuated, and on some days no one gets out.\n\u201cHonestly speaking, any child who needs it should be able to get out through this process. But unless you see a foreigner, or somebody connects you to an NGO, or you somehow get on the news, it\u2019s very, very difficult,\u201d said Ayesha Khan, a Stanford University doctor who also recently volunteered in Gaza.\nFour-year-old Mira Dreni, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head in August, is one of the children waiting for a medical evacuation. Doctors in Gaza were able to save Mira from the initial injury, but because she is still growing, the hollow surgical tube placed in her brain to help keep her alive needs to be replaced, a procedure that medical facilities in Gaza cannot perform.\nMira\u2019s application for a medical evacuation has been pending for months, and her mother, Israa Haboush, said the last update she received from the World Health Organization was that they were still awaiting Israeli security checks.\nFor injured children, both the child and a family member must be approved for travel. Male relatives are most frequently denied security approval, and those individuals denied are not informed why, according to aid organizations. Syed, the doctor from Washington state, said that in some instances, the rules limiting one caregiver per patient are separating families.\n\u201cWhat it\u2019s doing is it\u2019s forcing parents to make a decision between leaving their children behind or getting care,\u201d she said. These decisions are all the more agonizing because of heightened uncertainty about their ability to return since Trump proposed displacing all Palestinians from Gaza.\nSuhad Khateeb, who left Gaza for Doha with her two youngest sons for emergency treatment, said she never would have expected to still be separated from her husband a year later.\nShe said the first few days after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike were a frantic blur. Khateeb\u2019s 4-year-old son, Wissam, was inside the house when it was hit. The building partially collapsed, and Wissam suffered injuries to his head and face so severe that doctors at the first hospital she took him to refused to give him a bed.\n\u201cThey thought he would die immediately. I had to beg for a blood transfusion,\u201d Khateeb said. Once he was stabilized, she got seats in a United Nations convoy traveling to southern Gaza. From there, she was transferred to a hospital in Egypt and a few weeks later to Doha, where her son finally got specialized treatment.\nSince then, Wissam has made a remarkable recovery, she said. When they first arrived, he had lost the ability to speak because of the swelling around his brain. Now he\u2019s begun walking a bit on his own. Khateeb and her sons live in a compound outside Doha initially built to house athletes during the 2022 World Cup.\nNow, the rows of neat apartment blocks are full of Palestinian families. In a central courtyard, groups of children run and play despite carrying scars from a war more than 1,000 miles away: severe burns, amputated limbs, missing digits.\nKhateeb dismissed Trump\u2019s comments about emptying Gaza as \u201ccrazy talk, dreams.\u201d But when asked about her future, she acknowledged that she cannot return to Gaza until Wissam is fully healed \u2014 and that could be years away. She said her decision to leave her husband and older children fills her with such overpowering sadness that for days at a time she can\u2019t eat.\nOther Palestinians in the compound describe similar feelings. Yehya al-Ustaz, 68, suffered two broken legs when his home in Gaza was hit by an airstrike and now relies on a wheelchair.\nHe said he\u2019s been horrified by images of the destruction in the enclave. \u201cAn earthquake would have been kinder.\u201d But he said, \u201cNothing is like Gaza. Ultimately, Gaza is home. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n<i>Hajar Harb in London contributed to this report.</i>"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:27:44"}
