Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nSnow and slush didn\u2019t dampen street style at New York Fashion Week\nNEW YORK \u2014 When I was sent to photograph New York Fashion Week in September 2024, many people I spoke with were shocked to hear it was my first time. I\u2019ve been working as a photographer for 25 years, but in this arena, I felt something like an alien. Coming back this week for a second time was more familial. One word that comes to mind, to sum it all up, is <i>community</i>. It\u2019s remarkable, and to state the obvious \u2014 beautiful \u2014 to see the art of garments, hats, shoes and accessories, celebrated with such reverence and a kinship among fashion fans and favorites.\nFebruary\u2019s fashion seemed extra chilly with a dash of snowflakes. I had hoped to get images of models in the streets as several inches of snow fell, but that didn\u2019t happen with much of the snow coming overnight. But the slick, slushy sidewalks were not enough to keep people from showing up in their finest.\nSure, most of these folks were headed inside to witness the latest designs come down the runways. But the real circus is indeed outside of these events. Dozens of fashion editors, models, designers, stylists and even the want-to-be-seen parade down the streets \u2014 sometimes even stopping traffic. I saw amateur and professional photographers turning their lenses on fashionistas in the middle of intersections as motorists angrily honked their horns. This is where all the action is.\nI\u2019m highly attracted to the fun chaos of it all. Folks proudly sashaying down alleys. People wearing garments of all kinds \u2014 some they made themselves. The funniest accessory I saw at a fashion show was a cheetah-printed bong, and the model had the pants to match. It is indeed a community, an eclectic one at that.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:31:24"}
