Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nJudge briefly extends order barring Trump from firing watchdog leader\nA federal judge on Wednesday extended for three days an order preventing the Trump administration from firing the head of an independent watchdog agency that has sought to pause President Donald Trump\u2019s mass termination of some probationary federal workers.\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she wanted more time to consider the lawyers\u2019 arguments before issuing a broader ruling on whether the administration\u2019s attempted ouster of Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, was unlawful. A temporary restraining order barring Dellinger\u2019s firing will remain in place until Saturday, she said.\nDellinger, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sued the administration after he received a one-sentence email earlier this month telling him he was fired from the office, which protects government whistleblowers. He said his termination violated a law that says the president can remove him only for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\u201d Jackson on Feb. 12 ordered him reinstated for two weeks while his case proceeds.\nThe Trump administration argues that the Constitution allows Trump to remove Dellinger and other agency leaders.\nOn Tuesday, an independent federal board <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/probationary-employee-firings-trump-musk-doge/\" target=\"_blank\">granted a request</a> by Dellinger to halt the administration\u2019s firings of six probationary government employees. Dellinger said the firings of those employees, and potentially many others, were <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/24/hampton-dellinger-special-counsel-filing-probationary-employees/\" target=\"_blank\">probably illegal</a>.\nIn court Wednesday morning, Jackson sharply questioned claims by the Trump administration\u2019s lawyer that Trump had the power to fire Dellinger without cause and that the law prohibiting him from doing so was unconstitutional. Unlike other agency heads, the special counsel was granted independence from the president to investigate potential wrongdoing by the administration, the judge said. Dellinger was appointed to a five-year term that ends in 2029.\n\u201cHis actual job is to be a check and balance on the president,\u201d Jackson said.\nThe judge pressed Justice Department lawyer Madeline McMahon to explain why it would be in the public interest to fire Dellinger.\nMcMahon said barring Dellinger\u2019s removal would cause Trump to \u201close control over an executive branch agency\u201d and would represent an \u201cintrusion\u201d into Trump\u2019s authority under the Constitution."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No. This article is primarily about a judge's decision/action to extend an order preventing the Trump administration from taking an action, rather than being about a new action or announcement from the Trump administration itself.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:21:15"}
