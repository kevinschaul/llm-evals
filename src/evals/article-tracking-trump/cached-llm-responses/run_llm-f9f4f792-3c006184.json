Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nMen may be more romantic than women, experts say\nThe question:\nIs it true that men are more romantic than women?\nThe science:\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miHn0n4sAz4\" target=_blank>Hollywood</a> has<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRw2d7hRR9o\" target=_blank> made</a> men the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SixsaGWC2Io\" target=_blank>embodiment</a> of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyrP-pwDayE\" target=_blank>romance</a> in heterosexual <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEWaqUVac3M\" target=_blank>relationships</a>. But whether men are more romantic in real life may depend on how you define romanticism, as well as the cultural, societal and other expectations that may influence romantic behaviors, some experts said.\nIn American culture, there is often an expectation that men plan and pay for the date, buy the flowers and pull out the chair, said <a href=\"https://kinseyinstitute.org/about/profiles/jgarcia.php\">Justin Garcia</a>, executive director of the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University.\n\u201cEven as we\u2019ve seen more gender egalitarian tendencies in dating,\u201d he added, there are \u201cstill a lot of gender norms around that. It makes it, in many ways, appear like men do more romantic things because they\u2019re expected to.\u201d\nExpectations aside, \u201cI think men are more romantic than they\u2019re often given credit for,\u201d said Garcia, an evolutionary biologist and sex researcher.\nResearch has not suggested that men may be more romantic than women across the board. But in <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407589064001\">a 1989 study</a> that developed the romantic beliefs scale, which is widely used in research to measure how strongly someone agrees or disagrees with romantic ideas such as love at first sight, researchers noted that, generally, men were more likely than women to endorse the ideology of romanticism and hold romantic beliefs.\nOther research suggests that men have a tendency to <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/romantic-relationships-matter-more-to-men-than-to-women/52E626D3CD7DB14CD946F9A2FBDA739C\">strive harder to establish romantic relationships</a> and benefit more from them, to be the first to <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0022412\">say \u201cI love you\u201d</a> and to <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/romantic-relationships-matter-more-to-men-than-to-women/52E626D3CD7DB14CD946F9A2FBDA739C\">suffer more</a> from love lost. Many studies are limited in that they are self-reported surveys, represent smaller subsets of the overall population and often focus on heterosexual relationships.\nIn <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/romantic-relationships-matter-more-to-men-than-to-women/52E626D3CD7DB14CD946F9A2FBDA739C\">examining</a> numerous psychological and sociological studies on gender differences in relationships, researchers noted last year that one possible explanation may be that men tend to rely more on their significant others for emotional support and are less likely to seek it outside of their romantic relationships.\nA 2021 <a href=\"https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/\">survey</a> reported that men are significantly less likely than women to share their personal feelings or receive emotional support from a friend.\nDespite the research suggesting that men tend to hold more romantic ideals, women are often perceived in society as more romantic, said Gwendolyn Seidman, a visiting scholar in the department of psychology at Michigan State University. Seidman said this may be because women tend to view themselves as <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laura-Madson/publication/14014155_Models_of_the_self_Self-construals_and_gender/links/02bfe513dfaae80869000000/Models-of-the-self-Self-construals-and-gender.pdf\">being connected to their romantic partners</a>, crave more <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407599165002\">closeness and connection</a> in romantic relationships, and put more effort into maintenance \u2014 thinking about the relationship, seeking social support and initiating discussions about the relationship, <a href=\"https://interpersona.psychopen.eu/index.php/interpersona/article/view/3467\">one study suggested</a>.\nTechnically, \u201cthat\u2019s different from being romantic,\u201d Seidman said.\nIn relationship<b> </b>research, romanticism refers to general beliefs about love, rather than actions taken within romantic relationships, Seidman said. \u201cBelieving in love at first sight or that we all have only one true love doesn\u2019t relate to how much effort you put into your actual relationship day in and day out,\u201d she said.\nWhile there are notable differences in how men and women think about, approach and engage in romantic relationships, it is important to remember that romanticism may mean different things to different couples, some experts said.\nWhat matters is that both men and women tend to want the same things out of their relationships, said <a href=\"https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/paul-eastwick\">Paul Eastwick</a>, a professor of psychology at the University of California at<b> </b>Davis.\n\u201cThe same things that make men happy are going to be the same things that make women happy \u2014 having somebody who has your back, somebody you can go to when you\u2019ve had successes, be with you when times are hard, somebody who\u2019s exciting and makes you laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is not a shred of evidence that men and women differ in the extent to which they care about those things.\u201d\nWhat else you should know:\nIn the spirit of Valentine\u2019s Day, The Washington Post asked readers to share stories about a significant other\u2019s most romantic gesture, and we were swept away by them. Here are some of our favorites, lightly edited for style and clarity:\n\u201cMy boyfriend has to ship out for two months. He made the most adorable handmade cards for each week he\u2019s gone, based around inside jokes, favorite memories, etc. He also got me a piece of jewelry referencing my favorite song for our anniversary (\u2018Call It What You Want\u2019 by Taylor Swift).\u201d <i>\u2014 Allie Young, 19, Massachusetts</i>\n\u201cJoining me on trips to see my father in hospice states away. It\u2019s not a romantic gesture as people might think, but is an act of support and love \u2014 love for me, for our relationship, for my family, and for my dad. She has also willingly given up our date nights so we can take my dad\u2019s wife out to dinner \u2026 her love extends to everyone she knows and meets, and that is the most wildly romantic thing I could ever imagine!\u201d <i>\u2014 Jonathan Cooper, 50, Pennsylvania</i>\n\u201cWith finals looming last semester, seasonal depression slowly started to get to me, and anyone who came into my dorm room could tell. Clothes piled high on the floor, and the pile on my twin sized bed often toppled into its companion pile. I did not have the motivation to do anything about it. But I came back one day to a clean room. My boyfriend had texted my roommate who let him in. He folded my clothes and hung my pants up on hangers in my wardrobe. It truly is the small things.\u201d <i>\u2014 Zachary Clifton, 19, Connecticut</i>\n\u201cIn fourth grade, a quiet, slender, blond little boy moved from California to our small Arkansas town. When Valentine\u2019s rolled around that first year he was there, among the store-bought cards I received was a red homemade Valentine. It opened to reveal a hand-drawn and colored Queen of Hearts playing card. Across the Valentine was written, \u2018You are the Queen of Hearts in my life.\u2019 It was from that adorable new boy, Jonathan. I was overwhelmed and showed the Valentine to my family. I wanted so badly to tell him that I had a huge crush on him, too, but I was too bashful. I never said a word about it or how I loved it to him. We both graduated, went to separate colleges and married other people. I kept Jonathan\u2019s Valentine well into my 30s. Jump to my 25-year class reunion: I was divorced, and Jonathan showed up, in the midst of a divorce. We had not seen each other since graduation night. The first thing I asked him was, \u2018Do you remember that Valentine you gave me in fourth grade?\u2019 He did. We got married two years later and have been married for 11 years now. He is my forever Valentine.\u201d <i>\u2014 Mary Katherine Foy, 56, Texas</i>\nThe bottom line:\nWhile some research suggests that there is a greater tendency for men to hold certain romantic beliefs such as love at first sight, romanticism is significantly influenced by<b> </b>cultural, societal, generational and individual relationship dynamics, experts said.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 10:57:23"}
