Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nDemocratic AGs score early wins against Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship ban\nConnecticut Attorney General William Tong, the son of Chinese immigrants, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/-first-sue-opposing-trumps-desire-end-birthright-citizenship-personal-rcna184891\" target=\"_blank\">laid down a marker</a> when asked in December about Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to end birthright citizenship: \u201cI would be the first to sue.\u201d\nThree weeks later, he was the first \u2014 but he was not standing alone.\nBehind the scenes, Tong and fellow Democratic attorneys general from 21 states and D.C. had signed a confidential \u201ccommon interest agreement\u201d to share information, collaborate on legal briefs and join forces on litigation to fight Trump on a potential U.S. citizenship ban. Their arrangement took effect Nov. 14, just nine days after the presidential election, according to a copy of the document obtained by The Washington Post.\nThat early partnership and planning has paid off. At a time when congressional Democrats have appeared politically flat-footed in response to the shock-and-awe tactics of Trump\u2019s first month in the White House, this group of attorneys general has responded with a legal fire wall on a case that has become one of the first clear examples of a coordinated resistance to the administration\u2019s extraordinary efforts to expand presidential power and challenge constitutional limits.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit recently <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/20/trump-birthright-citizenship-appeal-case/\" target=_blank>upheld a Seattle judge\u2019s nationwide injunction</a> on Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship order in one of the two cases brought by the Democratic states. Judges in both of those cases, and two others brought by civil rights groups, have issued injunctions. Legal experts said the issue could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\u201cWe did not wake up the day after the election and say, \u2018Oh, no, what are we going to do now?\u2019\u201d Tong said in a recent interview. \u201cNobody was taking any chances, so, sure, we were talking about the possibility that Trump would win, and he telegraphed all the things he wanted to do during the campaign. What I said to people after he was elected is that, as a minimum response, we should take him at his word that he will do everything that he said he was going to do. And so he has.\u201d\nThe legal challenge to Trump\u2019s attempted ban is part of a broader effort by Democratic attorneys general, who have now teamed up on eight multistate lawsuits against Trump\u2019s actions and scored some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/trump-lawsuits-executive-orders-actions-legal-challenges/\" target=_blank>key early wins in federal court</a>. They say they are prepared for a long, sustained legal fight, one informed by lessons learned during Trump\u2019s first administration, in which the Democratic states were slower to act collectively.\nMost legal scholars say the citizenship clause of the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment grants birthright citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil other than the children of foreign diplomats. Trump\u2019s order, which seeks to ban it for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreigners in the country on temporary visas, could affect more than 150,000 newborns annually, according to some independent studies.\nStarting early last year, the attorneys general say, their offices began to communicate about how to establish a legal bulwark against Trump\u2019s campaign promises to take unprecedented executive actions. Birthright citizenship, which Trump discussed frequently on the campaign trail, emerged as a likely early target and an issue on which the Democratic attorneys general believed they were on firm legal footing.\nLegal scholars have overwhelmingly called the matter settled law, pointing to an 1898 Supreme Court ruling that Wong Kim Ark, the San Francisco-born son of Chinese immigrants who was denied reentry to the country, was a U.S. citizen.\nThe attorneys general also examined the road map laid out in Project 2025, a blueprint for expanding presidential authority published by the conservative Heritage Foundation.\nTheir preparation was evident after Trump, on his first day in office, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/\" target=\"_blank\">signed an executive order</a> seeking to curb automatic citizenship.\nThe next day, all 22 Democratic states, along with D.C. and the city of San Francisco, challenged the order as unconstitutional in a pair of federal lawsuits \u2014 a 32-page filing in Seattle and a 50-page filing in Boston. Judges in both cases have issued nationwide injunctions against Trump\u2019s order, with the Seattle judge calling it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/06/trump-birthright-citizenship/\" target=_blank>\u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d</a>\n\u201cWe drafted the bulk of the lawsuit before the president signed his order at 8 o\u2019clock at night. When he signed it, we were ready to go, and we filed the next morning,\u201d said New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, who along with Tong and Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell took the lead in the Boston case. \u201cIt was a function of the work and collaboration we had done over the better part of a year.\u201d\nWashington state, which led the challenge to Trump\u2019s travel ban for immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries during his first term, took the lead on the Seattle filing on the birthright lawsuit last month. The state\u2019s attorney general, Nick Brown, said his office had done a significant amount of work on the issue and shared it with colleagues in other offices. Oregon, Illinois and Arizona joined Washington in filing that case.\n\u201cWe had both substantive expertise and interest in doing that, and our office communicated early on that we wanted to take a leadership role,\u201d Brown said. He noted that his office, with more than 800 attorneys, is one of the largest in the nation. \u201cWe felt like we had a good case to make here.\u201d\nTheir strategy to confront Trump on birthright citizenship and other issues reflects an accelerating pattern of multistate challenges against the federal government brought largely along party lines, said Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University, who <a href=\"https://attorneysgeneral.org/multistate-lawsuits-vs-the-federal-government/list-of-lawsuits-1980-present/\" target=_blank>maintains a database</a> to track such cases.\nHe identified 76 multistate lawsuits during President George W. Bush\u2019s eight years in office and 80 in President Barack Obama\u2019s two terms. The numbers skyrocketed to 160 cases during Trump\u2019s first term and 133 in President Joe Biden\u2019s four-year tenure.\n\u201cAGs are suing over just about everything \u2014 every major policy, every regulation, every attempt to reverse a previous administration,\u201d Nolette said. He added that the increasingly prominent role of judges, in lieu of Congress, in establishing federal policy is unhealthy for a democratic system.\nTrump\u2019s allies argue that birthright citizenship offers an incentive for immigrants to try to enter the United States illegally and helps them fight deportation once they give birth here. While 89 percent of the public supports deporting undocumented immigrants with violent criminal records, just 30 percent are in favor of removing parents whose children are U.S. citizens, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2025/02/19/feb-13-18-2025-washington-post-ipsos-poll/\" target=_blank>a recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll</a>.\nMike Howell, executive director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Oversight Project, said the intensive focus of the Democratic attorneys general on the birthright citizenship issue demonstrated what he called their \u201cnakedly political\u201d interests around immigration. He suggested Democrats are interested in maintaining a core voting constituency by ensuring more immigrants gain citizenship, a theory for which there is no evidence.\nIndependent polling has found that illegal immigration to the United States is driven by migrants seeking better economic opportunity and freedom from political persecution in their home countries.\n\u201cIt is not surprising to see they have such an agreement,\u201d Howell said, referring to the legal agreement the attorneys general signed in November. \u201cWhat this document does is confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt the priority of this \u2014 a major muscle movement to get this many states on one document together.\u201d\nTong scoffed at the notion that the coordinated effort aimed to consolidate the votes of immigrant communities. \u201cThis was a direct attack on people, on babies, on children, on families in Connecticut,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople viscerally understand that. This was not a hard one for me.\u201d\nCivil rights groups also have filed six lawsuits challenging the birthright citizenship order. Advocates said they try to coordinate with the states, which have much larger staffs and can bring broader claims of potential harm.\nThe civil rights groups are representing pregnant individuals whose children would be denied citizenship, while the states have argued that they would lose federal revenue to help provide public benefits for the children and be tasked with new administrative burdens to help enforce Trump\u2019s order.\nThe states also are getting support from blue cities, including San Francisco, where City Attorney David Chiu said his support of the states\u2019 birthright citizenship lawsuit is based in part on the city\u2019s history in the Wong Kim Ark case.\n\u201cOur office wants to make sure the story \u2026 is told accurately and litigated fully,\u201d said Chiu, who is in touch with Wong\u2019s descendants. The family, he said, is \u201chorrified at the idea that the 14th Amendment and that case could be summarily ignored by the president of the United States.\u201d"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No - this article is primarily about Democratic state attorneys general preparing for and responding to Trump's actions on birthright citizenship, rather than describing a new action or announcement from the Trump administration itself.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:20:32"}
