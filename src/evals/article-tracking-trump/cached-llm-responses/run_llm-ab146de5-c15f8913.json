{"args": ["claude-3.7-sonnet", "\nIs this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump curbs enforcement of foreign antibribery law\nPresident Donald Trump directed the Justice Department on Monday to relax enforcement of a law used to prosecute U.S. companies who bribe foreign officials, saying it has put American business at a competitive disadvantage while operating abroad.\nIn an executive order, the president instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to pause actions taken under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act until the Justice Department can draft new guidance that \u201cpromotes American competitiveness and efficient use of federal law enforcement resources.\u201d\nA fact sheet the White House distributed along with the order asserted that the law had long harmed U.S. companies through \u201coverenforcement because they are prohibited from engaging in practices common among international competitors, creating an uneven playing field.\u201d\nEnacted in 1977, the FCPA bars American businesses or their representatives from offering money or gifts to foreign officials to win business overseas. Since then, large corporations, including Lockheed Martin, Goldman Sachs, Haliburton, Chiquita, Goodyear and Daimler AG, have at points all run afoul of the statute, agreeing to multimillion-dollar settlement deals to resolve allegations that they\u2019d provided illegal enticements to foreign leaders.\nTrump\u2019s antipathy toward the FCPA predates his time in the White House. <a href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000089630&play=1\" target=_blank>In a 2012 appearance on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d</a> he called the statute \u201cridiculous\u201d and a \u201chorrible law.\u201d\n\u201cEvery other country in the world is doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to do so. It puts us at a huge disadvantage.\u201d\nTrump publicly floated the idea of restricting enforcement during his first term but ultimately took no action. Even before his executive order Monday, Bondi had moved to narrow the Justice Department\u2019s pursuit of foreign antibribery cases.\nWithin hours of being sworn in as attorney general last week, she issued a directive instructing prosecutors to prioritize FCPA cases \u201crelated to foreign bribery that facilitates criminal operations of [drug and human smuggling] cartels\u201d and \u201cshift away from investigations that do not involve such a connection.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:08:53"}
