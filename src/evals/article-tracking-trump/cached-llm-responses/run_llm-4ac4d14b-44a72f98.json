{"args": ["openai/gpt-4.1-mini", "Is this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\n3D analysis shows how helicopter pilots could have mixed up jets in DCA crash\nOn the night of Jan. 29, an Army Black Hawk helicopter <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/01/30/dc-plane-crash-deaths-survivors-potomac-reagan-airport/\">collided</a> with an American Airlines passenger jet over the Potomac River in Washington, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/interactive/2025/dca-plane-crash-victims-list-profiles/\">killing all 67 people</a> on both aircraft.\nAviation experts have since raised the possibility that, after being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/01/31/audio-air-traffic-control-dc-plane-crash/\">alerted</a> by air traffic <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/30/dc-plane-crash-helicopter-recovery-no-survivors-potomac-river/\">controllers</a> to the presence of the jet, the helicopter crew might have mistaken that plane for another<b> </b>incoming jet in the distance.\nTo analyze this theory, The Washington Post made a 3D model, using <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/30/videos-photos-dc-plane-crash-potomac-river/\">flight data</a> and air traffic control transmissions, and conducted interviews with five former Black Hawk pilots to recreate the view the crew likely had from inside the helicopter cockpit.\nOur examination shows how the American Airlines jet and the second plane, though separated by miles, would have appeared close to one another near the horizon and the helicopter crew could have confused the two jets when the tower first warned of incoming air traffic. The examination further shows how around a minute later, as viewed from the helicopter cockpit, the lights of the incoming American Airlines jet could have been obscured by the glow of the city skyline, allowing the jet to go undetected.\nThe causes of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/31/dc-plane-crash-happened-potomac-river/\">crash</a> remain under investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board has said the helicopter was flying above its mandated 200-foot ceiling and that its crew was likely wearing night vision goggles, which pilots said can complicate the task of tracking other aircraft.\nAt 8:46 p.m. the Black Hawk was flying south along the Potomac and the American Airlines jet was heading north on approach for landing at <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/30/reagan-airport-airspace-plane-crash-washington-dc/\">Reagan National Airport</a>.\n\n\n1 minute 58 seconds until impact\nAir traffic control alerts the helicopter to the presence of a CRJ, a type of regional jet. The plane is bound for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/02/04/dca-close-calls-plane-collisions-history/\">a runway</a> that will bring it close to the helicopter corridor along the river. \u201c<i>Traffic just south of the Wilson Bridge is a CRJ at 1,200 feet for Runway 33.\u201d</i>\n1 minute 52 seconds until impact\nA member of the Black Hawk crew responds by requesting \u201cvisual separation\u201d \u2014 an acknowledgment that it has the jet in sight and will take steps to avoid it, according to aviation experts.<b> </b>The controller immediately grants the request.\n\nAround seven miles away from the helicopter is <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark>, the CRJ. This is the plane that will later collide with the helicopter.\nA second<b> </b>jet, <u>AA 5307,</u> is about to touch down<b> </b>on Runway 1.\nAnd traveling a little more than three miles<b> </b>directly behind <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark>, a third jet, <u>AA 3130,</u> is beginning its approach to the same runway.\nAt this distance, <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark> and <u>AA 3130</u> appear nearly aligned, the 3D model shows. Some pilots said variations in the brightness of the planes\u2019 lights could have helped the helicopter crew distinguish the aircraft. Other pilots said the two planes may have been hard to tell apart or appeared as one light, especially if the crew was wearing night vision goggles.\nThe UH-60L Black Hawk does not come with<b> </b>a radar screen that shows other aircraft traffic, an Army official said. It is common for helicopter crews to use iPads with an app that can track flights, though it is unclear if the crew was using one.\n\nAt this point, both the helicopter crew and air traffic controllers believe that the two aircraft have been safely directed, the transmissions indicate.\nWhat follows, pilots told The Post, is an opportunity for the <b>helicopter crew</b> to identify <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark>. The jet becomes visibly distinct as it peels away from the line of other inbound planes, veering east following the standard approach path for Runway 33.\nBut if the <b>helicopter crew</b> fails to do so before the jet passes over the city, it will soon be increasingly difficult for them to realize their potential error, pilots said.\nAbout a minute before impact, <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark> continues to curve east and north, away from the Potomac and over D.C.\n1 minute until impact\nFrom the helicopter crew\u2019s perspective, <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342\u2032s</mark> lights are likely blending with those of the city, pilots said. Night vision goggles amplify light, making it harder to tell light sources apart. They also reduce field of vision. Pilots say they mitigate the effect by swiveling their heads.\n<u>AA 3130</u>, on the other hand, is flying over the dark river. Pilots told The Post this would have made the<b> </b>plane\u2019s lights far easier for the helicopter crew to see.\n25 seconds until impact\nAir traffic control receives an automated conflict alert that the helicopter and <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark> are on a path to intersect. The controller again contacts the helicopter, using its call sign: <i>\u201cPAT-25, do you have the CRJ in sight?\u201d</i>\n17 seconds until impact\nThe controller instructs the helicopter: <i>\u201cPAT-25, pass behind the CRJ.\u201d</i>\nAt this point, <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark> is curving northwest toward the airport. The jet\u2019s position and the angle of approach could cause the landing lights to appear less prominent and potentially go unnoticed by the helicopter crew, pilots said.\n15 seconds until impact\nFor the second time, the helicopter crew confirms they see the jet: \u201c<i>PAT-25 has the, uh, aircraft in sight, request visual separation.\u201d</i>\nThey are probably looking at <u>AA 3130</u>, the pilots<b> </b>said.\nEven if the helicopter crew spots <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark>, they have little time to respond.\nThe jet is traveling at about 145 miles per hour and descending toward the level of the Black Hawk.\n2 seconds until impact\nThe<i><b> </b></i>helicopter transmits its last location.\n<mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark> would be visible around 1,000 feet from the helicopter. According to the NTSB, the jet\u2019s crew have \u201ca verbal reaction,\u201d and the plane increases its pitch. The sound of impact is audible a second later. Gasps can be heard on air traffic audio.\nFlight data records a sudden drop in the jet\u2019s altitude.\nArmy officials and former colleagues described the Black Hawk crew, members of the 12th Aviation Battalion, as experienced aviators: Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Eaves and Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, both pilots, and Staff Sgt. Ryan O\u2019Hara, the crew chief. The flight was part of an annual flying evaluation for Lobach.\nArmy officials declined to comment on the findings outlined in this report.\nScott Dunham, a former air traffic controller and retired longtime NTSB investigator, said the instructions given to the helicopter crew that night were typical but additional information could have been provided in the second warning to reorient the helicopter. Former pilots who flew this route said that air traffic controllers sometimes instruct helicopter crews to pause at a designated point about a mile north of the airport when airspace is congested.\nOn Jan. 31, the Federal Aviation Administration indefinitely restricted helicopter traffic along parts of two routes near Reagan National Airport while it reviews the safety of the airspace.\nBefore the collision, many pilots would have likely described the helicopter <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/30/dc-helicopters-potomac-river-dangers/\">route</a> around <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2025/01/31/dc-plane-crash-passengers-fear-flying/\">Reagan</a> as higher risk but part of a routine flight, in use for decades, said Austin Roth, a former Black Hawk instructor pilot who also served in the 12th Aviation Battalion.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s looking back and thinking maybe this was inevitable,\u201d he said.\nAbout this story\nThe Post used 3D modeling software to reconstruct the scene in the sky over Washington in the minutes leading up to the fatal collision. The Post imported OpenStreetMap data of roads and building footprints into the scene as well as commercially available models of the Black Hawk helicopter, the Bombardier CRJ-700 and additional aircraft. We plotted and animated the flight paths of all aircraft using data from ADS-B Exchange, and timed these alongside key moments from Air Traffic Control radio communications. The Black Hawk\u2019s Model S signal was picked up through multilateration, which can be imprecise because it requires multiple receivers to have line of sight. Two former helicopter pilots said data that appeared to show the helicopter turn sharply, west of Hains Point, was most likely an anomaly as the speed at that time would make such a turn unlikely, so The Post excluded this data point from the reconstruction. Altitude data for the helicopter was available only in 100 feet increments. By mounting a camera inside a model of the helicopter, we were able to show the pilot\u2019s perspective throughout the flight and display where key aircraft would have likely appeared in their field of vision. The lighting within the 3D model is a representation rather than an accurate depiction of the thousands of lights across the city, which would be too complex to precisely render at this scale. Pilots consulted for this story include Ken Biddulph, Phillip Brashear and Bradley Bowman who all flew this route many times.\nCredits: Story editing by Nadine Ajaka and Eric Rich.
