Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump administration freezes funds to Palestinian security forces\nJERICHO, West Bank \u2014 The Trump administration has stopped all funding to the Palestinian Authority security forces as part of the global freeze on foreign assistance, according to U.S. and Palestinian officials.\nThe freeze comes at a critical time for the embattled authority as it struggles to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/11/palestinian-authority-secuirty-forces-west-bank-faq/\" target=_blank>maintain its rule</a> in pockets of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and jockeys to govern a postwar Gaza Strip. The security forces, which are chronically underfunded and widely unpopular, are nonetheless <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/05/palestinian-authority-security-forces-gaza/\" target=_blank>considered a linchpin to the Palestinian Authority\u2019s ability to maintain law and order</a> in both territories.\nWashington last stopped direct aid to the authority during Trump\u2019s first term but continued to fund training and reform for the security forces. Exercises and courses are run through the Jerusalem-based Office of the Security Coordinator \u2014 formerly known as the U.S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which is made up of a consortium of countries.\nBrig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, spokesman for the Palestinian security forces, told The Washington Post that the United States was considered a \u201cbig donor to the PA projects\u201d that included security training for the forces.\nA former Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue said that the Palestinian Authority security forces were \u201cnot affected in any meaningful way\u201d by the freeze and that \u201cother donors have committed to make up the shortfall.\u201d\nBut the freeze has already led to cuts in some training, a colonel at the authority\u2019s Central Training Institute for security forces told The Post on Tuesday. He spoke on the condition of anonymity per his office\u2019s protocol.\nA meeting planned with American officials this month to assess the authority\u2019s operation targeting militants in the Jenin refugee camp \u2014 which stopped after Israeli forces invaded last month \u2014 was postponed and has not been rescheduled, he said. Washington was also funding the building of a virtual shooting range, which the institute needs because Israel will not permit the importation of bullets for live-fire training sessions, the colonel said. Though the project was almost completed, the institute is seeking alternative funders because of the U.S. freeze, he said.\nConfirmation of the aid freeze comes amid widespread confusion about programs the Trump administration is saving or suspending.\nU.S. officials have been loath to specify <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/29/pepfar-trump-hiv-aids-aid-pause/\" target=_blank>what programs</a> are spared under exemptions issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio for \u201clifesaving\u201d assistance, aid to Israel, HIV prevention programs and other priorities. And even in cases when exemptions apply, aid organizations have in many cases been unable to continue to work because Rubio\u2019s directives have effectively shut down the payment systems required to draw down funds.\nThe United States has for years supported the Palestinian Authority security forces, viewing them as critical to Israel\u2019s security. The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has provided approximately $1.1 billion in civilian security and justice assistance to support the authority\u2019s security forces since 2007, the State Department said last year.\nThe Biden administration also backed proposals for the Palestinian Authority to play a key role in postwar Gaza, which both Israel and Hamas, the authority\u2019s internal rival, oppose.\nThe authority is struggling to control a new generation of Palestinian militancy in the West Bank that\u2019s centered in the territory\u2019s northern refugee camps and draws support from widespread frustration with the aging authority leadership, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, who is 89.\n\nThe State Department said the funding is under review but did not provide clarity on when a determination is likely to be made. \u201cThe Department and USAID paused nearly all foreign assistance,\u201d the department said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Agency for International Development. \u201cThe Department of State has granted waivers for critical programming that aligns with Administration priorities in the region.\u201d\n<i>Hudson reported from Washington.
