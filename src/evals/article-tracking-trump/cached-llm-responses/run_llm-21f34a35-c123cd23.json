Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nHouse Republicans announce panel to continue investigation into Jan. 6\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) announced a new select subcommittee to continue House Republicans\u2019 investigation into the events leading up to and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\nThe committee will be chaired by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Georgia), who in the last Congress led the conference\u2019s investigation into the Jan. 6 select committee and the broader security response to the Capitol attack. It will be under the purview of the House Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio.)\nLoudermilk\u2019s team published a 128-interim report last month chronicling investigators\u2019 findings and has repeatedly said more work was needed to build on his panel\u2019s findings.\n\u201cHouse Republicans are proud of our work so far in exposing the false narratives peddled by the politically motivated January 6 Select Committee during the 117th Congress, but there is still more work to be done,\u201d Loudermilk said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are establishing this Select Subcommittee to continue our efforts to uncover the full truth that is owed to the American people. The composition and other details regarding the Select Subcommittee will be announced soon.\u201d\nThe effort is a part of the Republican Party\u2019s broader push to recast the violent events of Jan. 6, 2021, and comes on the heels of Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/20/trump-pardons-jan-6-defendants/\" target=_blank>blanket pardon</a> Monday evening of virtually all of the Jan. 6 defendants.
