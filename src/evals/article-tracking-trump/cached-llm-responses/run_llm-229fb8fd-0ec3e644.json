{"args": ["llama-3.2-3b-4bit", "\nDoes this describe a specific, new, official action or formal announcement already taken/made by the Trump administration? Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nPurdue Pharma owners strike new $6.5 billion deal in opioid case\nThe billionaire family that owns Purdue Pharma, maker of the pain medication blamed for helping fuel the nation\u2019s opioid crisis, has agreed to increase payments to settle long-running litigation against the company, promising to pay $6.5 billion over 15 years as part of a deal announced Thursday by several state attorneys general.\nThe deal comes after the Supreme Court in June blocked a controversial bankruptcy plan for Purdue that shielded Sackler family members \u2014 who themselves did not file for bankruptcy \u2014 from future opioid lawsuits in exchange for paying up to $6 billion over 18 years.\nThe new deal, if approved by a New York federal bankruptcy judge and state courts, will allow governments and victims who don\u2019t agree to the settlement to pursue lawsuits against the Sacklers. The agreement also calls for setting aside an initial $200 million \u2014 and up to $800 million \u2014 to use toward defending the Sacklers against those future claims, according to the offices of the New York and Connecticut attorneys general; money not used after five years would begin to revert to states.\n\u201cI have said since Day 1 that this fight has been about justice and accountability for the hundreds of thousands of victims and families wrecked by the opioid epidemic,\u201d Connecticut Attorney General William Tong <a href=\"https://portal.ct.gov/ag/press-releases/2025-press-releases/purdue-pharma-and-sackler-family-settlement-in-principle\" target=_blank>said</a> in a statement. \u201cThere will never be enough justice or dollars to restore those families or right this terrible wrong.\u201d\nThe total deal is worth $7.4 billion, with Purdue contributing nearly $900 million to pay governments and victims. If approved, a significant portion of the money will be paid within three years, state officials said.\nThe company, in a statement, said the new agreement will deliver billions of dollars to \u201ccompensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver treatment and overdose rescue medicines that will save lives.\u201d Representatives from multiple branches of the Sackler family did not reply to requests for comment.\nThe announcement adds another chapter to the winding legal saga involving the pharmaceutical company that earned billions of dollars from the blockbuster painkiller OxyContin as sales representatives in the late 1990s and early 2000s aggressively marketed the drug while downplaying the risk of addiction. Purdue, facing a tsunami of lawsuits from governments, tribes, hospitals, opioid victims and others, filed for bankruptcy in 2019, pausing legal claims against the company.\nSackler family members have denied wrongdoing or personal responsibility, although two branches of the family in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/03/10/opioid-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-sackler/\" target=_blank>an earlier statement</a> to a bankruptcy court expressed regret that \u201cOxyContin, a prescription medicine that continues to help people suffering from chronic pain, unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis that has brought grief and loss to far too many families and communities.\u201d\nLawsuits against Purdue and the Sacklers have loomed as part of wider litigation against pharmaceutical companies, drug distributors, pharmacy retail chains, pharmacy benefit managers and others accused of helping fuel the nation\u2019s opioid crisis. Governments have alleged that the distributors and pharmacies failed to flag suspicious orders of prescription opioids, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/10/opioids-ohio-supreme-court-cvs-walgreens-walmart/\" target=_blank>stretching thin</a> the public safety and health resources of communities hard hit by addiction.\nCompanies have agreed to about $50 billion in settlements \u2014 money intended to help communities ease the effects of the epidemic by paying for overdose reversal medications, addiction treatment, education, police resources and other uses.\nPurdue\u2019s initial bankruptcy plan proved controversial, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/12/03/purdue-pharma-supreme-court-bankruptcy-settlement/\" target=_blank>dividing families</a> who have lost relatives to addiction and drug overdoses. Supporters insisted that the deal would provide much-needed money to communities to address the epidemic. They pointed out that nearly all the creditors who voted on the plan approved of the deal.\nCritics asserted the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/10/14/sackler-family-opioids-legal-strategy-lawsuits/\" target=_blank>Sacklers</a>, who withdrew $11 billion from the company in the years leading up to the bankruptcy, were not paying enough and would avoid civil trials. The family has long said the withdrawals were lawful and nearly half was paid to taxes.\nThe Justice Department objected, saying bankruptcy law did not allow the Sacklers to get shielded from lawsuits from future parties who did not consent. A divided<b> </b>Supreme Court in June <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/27/purdue-pharma-supreme-court-opioid-bankruptcy/\" target=_blank>ruled</a> in the Justice Department\u2019s favor.\nThe new deal hashed out through court-ordered mediation mirrors the previous plan in key ways. The family would relinquish control of Purdue, which would be refashioned into a company whose earnings would go toward curbing the opioid epidemic. Millions of internal Purdue documents chronicling the company\u2019s role in the opioid crisis would be made public.\nThe settlement \u201crepresents justice for the untold victims who suffered because the Sacklers put profits above people,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.\nThe new settlement will also pay between $800 million and $850 million in total compensation to opioid victims, a boost from the previous figure, which allowed for payments of up to $750 million.\n\u201cThe new settlement is an improvement over the old one, but for those who say this is a vindication of the government\u2019s senseless appeals \u2026 the hundreds of victims who lost their lives because of the delay, would beg to differ,\u201d said Edward Neiger, an attorney who represents a committee made up of thousands of victims.\n\nMore than a dozen states \u2014 including California, Florida, New York and Virginia \u2014 participated in the talks and must now seek participation from other states and local governments who have sued. Some governments may roll the dice at trial. For instance, Nassau County, New York, has \u201cmade it clear the Sacklers will be in a courtroom in New York regardless of this new effort to derail a jury trial,\u201d said attorney Hunter Shkolnik, who represents the county.\nRelatives of some opioid victims also criticized the deal.\nSince 2000, hundreds of thousands have died in the United States of prescription opioid overdoses, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The crisis recently has evolved into an even deadlier phase, marked by the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl that typically are illegally manufactured and imported.\nEd Bisch, who lost his son to an overdose and runs a group called Relatives Against Purdue Pharma, said victims \u201cpaid with their lives and get peanuts in the end \u2014 while states collect billions in blood money.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 09:52:47"}
