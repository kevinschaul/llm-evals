{"args": ["openai/gpt-4.1", "\nDoes this describe a specific, new, official action or formal announcement already taken/made by the Trump administration? Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nWith Gaza rule at stake, Palestinian forces struggle to make their case\nJENIN, West Bank \u2014 The Palestinian Authority recently took a high-stakes gamble in this restive city, launching a major military operation aimed at clipping the wings of militant groups that had grown in influence and audacity.\nIf the operation succeeded, Palestinian security forces would demonstrate they could maintain order not only in the parts of the West Bank they nominally control but also, if given the chance, perhaps in Gaza as well. The role of the Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza is very much a live question as foreign powers and Arab states now debate the future of the war-torn enclave.\nBut the six-week campaign in Jenin, which lost momentum after Israeli forces intervened last month, ultimately came up badly short and exposed some of the challenges the authority would face in securing Gaza. While the security forces arrested dozens of Iranian-backed fighters, high-profile militants remain at large.\nThe clashes highlighted how poorly equipped the Palestinian Authority security forces are compared with the groups they are seeking to subdue. The campaign also underlined questions about how far Palestinians would go to fight fellow Palestinians and whether the authority could maintain its popular legitimacy if it did so. Moreover, the events in Jenin revealed how Israel\u2019s actions, which include its own withering attacks<b> </b>on targets in the city, undermine the ability of the Palestinian Authority to exert its control.\nThe battle between the Palestinian security forces and an umbrella group of fighters in Jenin led by Palestinian Islamic Jihad left 15 dead, including at least six civilians, and dozens injured, a spokesman for the authority\u2019s forces said.\nThe questions raised about the Palestinian Authority\u2019s ability to rule come as governments in the region are racing by the end of this month to present a counterproposal to President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to displace all of the Gaza Strip\u2019s 2.2 million inhabitants. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there must be no role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, an alternative Arab plan, expected in the coming weeks, is certain to give the authority a central role, despite profound concerns about its capabilities.\nThe Jenin operation \u201cdemonstrated the limits of the PA security forces,\u201d said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIf you cannot succeed decisively in an operation like Jenin, how can you hope to tackle the infinitely more complex situation in Gaza?\u201d\nFirepower put to the test\nThe Jenin campaign was the biggest test so far of the Palestinian Authority forces, which are responsible for security control in the West Bank\u2019s major Palestinian population centers under the terms of the peace deal reached with Israel in the 1990s.\nThe forces include about 35,000 members and coordinate security and share intelligence with Israel, which continues to occupy the West Bank. The U.S. government has given Palestinian security forces about $1.1 billion since 2007, State Department officials said last year, and has supervised their training in Jordan. The Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/19/trump-aid-freeze-palestinian-authority-israel/\" target=_blank>stopped all funding to the Palestinian Authority security forces</a> as part of the global freeze on foreign assistance, according to U.S. and Palestinian officials.\nAt a news conference last month and in an interview last week, Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, spokesman for the security forces, outlined what he said were the accomplishments of the Jenin operation: Hundreds of militants and accomplices arrested. Illicit funds, explosives and weapons seized. Improvised bombs that had been planted in neighborhoods \u2014 meant, the militants said, to target Israeli soldiers \u2014 were defused.\n\u201cThe security services have the ability and readiness to deal with the situation in Gaza,\u201d Rajab said in the interview.\nBut Jenin residents, Israeli officials and analysts have panned the operation.\n\u201cIf the end result is that everybody in the world \u2014 and especially the U.S. and the Arab countries \u2014 see that the PA can\u2019t get control of 100 militants in Jenin, how can they secure Gaza?\u201d said Mairav Zonszein, senior Israel analyst at the International Crisis Group.\nAfter laying siege for about six weeks to the Jenin refugee camp, which is adjacent to the city, Palestinian security forces remained unable to penetrate its maze of narrow alleys. When Washington Post journalists visited the camp on two occasions in mid-January, armed militants strolled the streets while scouts with walkie-talkies stood watch on rooftops, unbothered by sporadic bursts of gunfire from security forces on the mountain above.\nThe operation was taxing for the residents of the camp. But compared with raids by the Israeli troops, for the militants, it was \u201ca break, a vacation,\u201d said Jihad, a senior member of the Jenin Battalion, the umbrella group of militants. Like some others interviewed for this story, Jihad gave only his first name out of fear of retribution.\nThe Jenin Battalion is better armed than the security forces, according to Tahani Mustafa, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst for the Palestinian territories. Many have M-16 rifles smuggled in from Jordan or bought from weapons traffickers in Israel, Jihad said. The authority\u2019s forces, in contrast, carry old Kalashnikov rifles. Israel has barred the Palestinian security forces from importing better weapons, ammunition and light armored vehicles.\nIn early January, the militants demonstrated their continued capabilities by shooting dead three Israelis driving through Funduq, a village outside the city. The Jenin Battalion claimed responsibility. Then, Jihad said, the gunmen slipped undetected back into the camp to take refuge.\nThe attack \u201cwas first a message to the PA, because they are besieging us, but that won\u2019t end our resistance against the occupation,\u201d he said.\nContrary to the authority\u2019s claims, Jihad said that only a handful of those arrested by the middle of last month were members of the battalion and that only one militant fighter had been killed by the security forces. Two other victims were unaffiliated teenagers.\nThe authority\u2019s forces, meanwhile, lost six members. Many others sustained injuries, a colonel who directs training at the authority\u2019s Central Training Institute for security forces said, speaking on the condition of anonymity according to his office\u2019s protocol.\nDuring a recent assessment of the operation, Palestinian security leaders concluded their forces had fallen short in hitting targets, engaging in close-quarters gun battles and dismantling improvised explosive devices, the colonel said. \u201cOur men have very basic experience and don\u2019t have protective gear, and the situation for them was very hard,\u201d he added.\nLoyalty put to the test\nViolence among Palestinian factions is hardly unprecedented. A bloody battle in Gaza in 2007 between Hamas and the Fatah party, which controls the Palestinian Authority, left dozens dead and culminated in the authority\u2019s ouster from the enclave. But for years, the internecine fighting had not reached the level recently seen in Jenin.\nThe military campaign this winter tested the loyalties of some authority security officers, raising questions about their willingness to turn their guns on other Palestinians. In one widely shared video, an officer from Jenin camp, Mustafa al-Qaniri, publicly resigned in protest. (His son, Ibrahim, whom Hamas claimed as a member, was later killed in an Israeli airstrike.)\nPalestinian Authority security personnel once commanded more respect in Palestinian society. It was \u201ca good job with a good salary,\u201d said a woman in Jenin named Alaa, whose husband signed on with the force more than a decade ago. But when he received orders in December to deploy in Jenin, he refused. \u201cIf he would fight against his people, how could he look them in the eyes?\u201d asked Alaa.\nHis family regarded Israelis, and not their fellow Palestinians, as the enemy. \u201cTo see someone from the same religion, same nationality, fighting against you? I feel like my heart is really breaking,\u201d said the family matriarch, Umm Hassan.\nThe authority was already unpopular with many Palestinians, due to concerns over corruption and ineptitude. But according to interviews in Jenin, the operation there made enemies out of skeptics, triggered blowback even among some authority supporters \u2014 and underscored how the authority\u2019s legitimacy is at risk when it cracks down on armed elements.\nThe campaign against the militants touched a nerve among many here who are frustrated with the authority\u2019s inaction in the face of raids by the Israeli military and rising violence by Israeli settlers. Eager to prevent an open war with Israel, the Palestinian Authority avoids confrontation with Israeli forces, so militant groups have positioned themselves as Jenin\u2019s defenders.\nIn the Damaj neighborhood, a militant hot spot, Issam Abu Amira, 50, surveyed the blackened husk of what had once been his home. Fourteen houses in the camp were torched in total. While the Palestinian Authority blamed militants, Jenin Mayor Mohammad Jarrar said authority forces were responsible.\nDown the street, Abu Amira\u2019s cousin, Amjad, 24, pointed to the cracked glass where a bullet had pierced his parents\u2019 bedroom window while they were sleeping. \u201cBefore this,\u201d he said, \u201cwe had no problem with the PA.\u201d\nNow, his mother, Umm Ibrahim, chimed in, \u201cwe hate them.\u201d Could she forgive the Palestinian Authority? \u201cNever,\u201d she said.\nThe Israeli military strikes\nIn mid-January, community leaders in Jenin brokered a truce agreement that would have ended the campaign by the Palestinian security forces and allowed the militants to hold onto their weapons, as long as they were discreet.\nA week later, the Israeli military resumed airstrikes in Jenin, killing 12 people over two nights, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. This was part of a major West Bank operation that has lasted more than three weeks, killing at least 25 people in the Jenin area \u2014 including the Funduq attackers \u2014 and displaced thousands of civilians, according to the Palestinian Authority, Israeli military and the United Nations.\nIsraeli officials said their operation was necessary because the authority had failed to root out Iranian-backed militancy. The authority has been \u201cspectacularly unsuccessful in countering terrorism in Jenin in particular,\u201d David Mencer, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office, said in a news conference last week.\nBut the campaign undermined the standing of the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian officials and Middle East analysts said that might have been part of the intention for a right-wing government that includes ministers opposed to the authority\u2019s existence.\n\u201cThe minute the Gaza ceasefire went into effect, the operation started in the West Bank. \u2026 On the political level, I see it as a way the [Israeli] government is asserting itself. It\u2019s saying, \u2018We still control you,\u2019\u201d Zonszein said.\nThe Israeli operation was \u201cmeant to embarrass the PA,\u201d according to Jarrar, Jenin\u2019s mayor. He added, \u201cI told them: \u2018The Israelis want you to be seen as crippled, ineffectual.\u2019\u201d\nThe sequence of events fueled the perception among Palestinians that Israel and the Palestinian Authority were working in tandem. The Israeli campaign flushed militants out of the camp, allowing Palestinian security officers to arrest dozens of fighters in the surrounding countryside.\nThe Palestinian security forces \u201claid the groundwork for the Israelis,\u201d said Nasser, Umm Ibrahim\u2019s husband.\n<i>Miriam Berger in Jericho, John Hudson in Washington and Heidi Levine in Jenin contributed to this report.</i>\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:57:40"}
