{"args": ["claude-3.5-sonnet", "\nDoes this describe a specific, new, official action or formal announcement already taken/made by the Trump administration? Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAfter under-the-radar retool, D.C. United hopes to \u2018prove people wrong\u2019\n<a href=\"https://www.dcunited.com/\" target=_blank>D.C. United</a> spent the offseason acquiring more than a dozen players, accounting for about half the roster. The goalkeeping corps is new. An Aussie center back arrived from Scotland, a Brazilian winger via Poland. Five newcomers are expected to start Saturday night\u2019s opener against Toronto FC at Audi Field.\nWhy, then, does it feel as if United did not accomplish much this winter?\nPerhaps because, unlike many teams around MLS, United did not make any blockbuster trades or sign a high-priced international player. Instead, it acquired three players who missed most of last season with injuries and four who toiled most, if not all, of 2024 in the second division. Two other acquisitions were MLS backups. Three came from overseas with modest fanfare, another through the college draft.\n\u201cFor those that have that perception, that\u2019s understandable,\u201d United Coach Troy Lesesne said of the restrained activity. \u201cWe\u2019ve signed some players that may not carry that type of [big] name but are very talented themselves. They fit our game model, and we believe in them, and we hope that D.C. United is going to be a platform for them to take off in their career.\u201d\nUnited has one of MLS\u2019s biggest names: captain <a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/players/christian-benteke/\" target=_blank>Christian Benteke</a>, MLS\u2019s scoring champion. He is D.C.\u2019s only designated player \u2014 the label for talent that exceeds salary cap restrictions and requires ownership to pay mostly out of pocket. Each team is allowed to employ up to three DPs.\nUnited\u2019s second slot remains filled by team assists leader Mateusz Klich, even though he is no longer on the roster. Though he was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/19/dc-united-mateusz-klich-trade/\" target=_blank>traded to Atlanta</a>, most of his contract remains on United\u2019s books.\nAlthough Lesesne and his players are upbeat, United failed to generate any offseason buzz in MLS circles. Accordingly, <a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/ranking-all-30-mls-teams-by-tier-for-2025\" target=\"_blank\">preseason predictions</a> have D.C. missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive year and finishing at or near the bottom of the 15-team Eastern Conference.\n\u201cYou want to be the team that\u2019s looked at as the big dogs in the league. You want to be one of the favorites and have that privilege of having the target on your back,\u201d all-star right back Aaron Herrera said. \u201cBut at the same time, we\u2019re realistic with ourselves. We saw what we did last year and where we ended up. So how do we expect to be [higher in] anyone\u2019s prediction? We\u2019re here to prove people wrong.\u201d\nSince Lesense and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/28/ally-mackay-dc-united-new-gm/\" target=_blank>General Manager Ally Mackay</a> took over before the 2024 season, the roster has been gutted. Benteke and injured midfielder Jackson Hopkins are the only players remaining from the 2023 opener.\nThis year\u2019s squad features not only 13 newcomers but four holdovers who either arrived deep into last season or missed most of the year with injury.\nReturning center back Lucas Bartlett has a new partner: Australia\u2019s Kye Rowles, a 2022 World Cup starter who played the past 2\u00bd years for Hearts in Scotland. The new starting goalkeeper is Kim Joon Hong, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/13/kim-joon-hong-dc-united/\" target=\"_blank\">a 21-year-old South Korean</a>.\nHosei Kijima, a rookie midfielder for St. Louis City last year, drew rave reviews from teammates in the preseason. Costa Rican Randall Leal (Nashville) and Brazilian <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/16/dc-united-signs-joao-peglow/\" target=_blank>Jo\u00e3o Peglow</a> (Polish league) also hope to bolster the attack. Brazilian playmaker <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/gabriel-pirani-brazil-united/\" target=_blank>Gabriel Pirani</a>, in his second full season in Washington, is aiming for a breakout year after showing bright signs late last season.\nLesesne will also need players to show improvement after mixed performances last year.\n\u201cWhen I look at myself, I\u2019m not saying I wasted a year, but as a young player, every year you want to take big steps forward,\u201d said Matti Peltola, a 22-year-old midfielder. \u201cIf I\u2019m not going to be able to take big steps forward this year, then I\u2019m really looking [in] the mirror, big time.\u201d\nWith some roster space and cap flexibility, United could continue to make changes until the initial roster deadline April 23. The summer transfer window, which opens in July, typically offers an abundant international marketplace.\n\u201cWe created a good group,\u201d Benteke said. \u201cEven though I\u2019m the captain [and] I\u2019m the leader, I believe the star of the team is going to be the group because the way we want to play, we will need all of us.\u201d\nLesesne has retained a high-pressure style designed to force turnovers and create immediate opportunities. In the preseason, he implemented a plan that also won\u2019t rely as heavily on Benteke (23 goals) and will generate a wider variety of chances.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in constant evolution and improvement,\u201d Lesesne said. \u201cIf you watched us in preseason, you could see, \u2018Okay, they\u2019re trying to go for something a little bit different.\u2019\u201d\nDefensively, United will need to tighten up not only in its own end but in transition. Last year, teams often unlocked D.C.\u2019s press and capitalized on open space. United conceded 70 goals, third most in MLS and second most in club history.\n\u201cThe intensity of the press is still going to be the same,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a couple different pieces, couple different moving parts.\u201d\nUnited will also need to improve its home performance after ending 2024 in a 1-6-5 rut at Audi Field and 4-8-5 overall. The team will play three of its first four matches at Buzzard Point, and none of those four opponents had a winning record last year.\nWhile championship aspirations seem far-fetched, Lesesne and the players say they see promise after <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/10/19/dc-united-misses-playoffs-charlotte-fc/\" target=_blank>narrowly missing the playoffs </a>last fall.\n(The front office also sees promise: To entice former season ticket holders to return, United promised a 30 percent rebate if the team fails to make the playoffs.)\n\u201cWe were competitive last year, and we started to show ourselves in terms of the proof of concept was there,\u201d Lesesne said. \u201cWe want to build on that, but we have to take a bigger step this year. I don\u2019t want to be around this position of nine, 10, 11 [in the standings] and just be in the mix. I\u2019d like us to take a step forward.\u201d\nD.C.
