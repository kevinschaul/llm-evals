Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nArgentina to withdraw from World Health Organization, following Trump\nArgentina will withdraw from the World Health Organization, a spokesman for President Javier Milei said Wednesday, just weeks after his ally, President Donald Trump, announced he would again pull out of the global health alliance.\nMilei instructed his foreign minister to leave the alliance due to \u201cprofound differences regarding health management, especially during the pandemic\u201d and \u201ca lack of independence from the political influence of some states,\u201d presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni said in a news conference Wednesday.\n\u201cArgentines are not going to allow an international organization to intervene in our sovereignty, much less in our health,\u201d Adorni said.\nThe move by South America\u2019s second-largest economy follows a Trump<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/\" target=\"_blank\"> executive order</a> that terminates the United States\u2019 commitment to the organization. Trump has accused the WHO of fueling the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\">coronavirus</a> pandemic that helped end his first presidency and  charged that it helped cover up the origins and spread of the virus.\nThe United States is responsible for nearly 20 percent of the WHO\u2019s funding. Public health experts warn that Trump\u2019s departure could cripple the organization\u2019s operations at a time when member nations are battling several dangerous outbreaks around the world and trying to stop the return of vaccine-preventable childhood diseases, such as measles. They also fear it could leave an opening for China to assume greater control over the agency that helps coordinate the response to international health crises, The Washington Post has<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/23/trump-world-health-organization/\" target=_blank> reported. </a>\nMilei, a libertarian economist whom Trump has called his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/20/trump-milei-argentina-similarities/\" target=_blank>favorite president</a>,\u201d is one of Trump\u2019s most important allies in Latin America. Milei attended Trump\u2019s inauguration and has often expressed his admiration for the U.S. president. After taking office in late 2023 on a promise to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/10/javier-milei-inauguration-argentina/\" target=_blank>take a chainsaw </a>to government, Milei has slashed regulations, government jobs and several entire agencies.\nArgentina does not receive WHO funding for its health management, Adorni said, so the decision will not mean \u201ca loss of funds for the country, nor does it affect the quality of services.\u201d However, Adorni added, it will allow the government greater flexibility to implement policies aligned with the \u201cinterests of Argentina.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:27:56"}
