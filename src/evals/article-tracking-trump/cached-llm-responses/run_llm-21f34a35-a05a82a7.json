{"args": ["claude-3.5-sonnet", "Is this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump posts video offering imagined vision of Gaza after his takeover plan\nPresident Donald Trump posted to his Truth Social account late Tuesday an apparently<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114068387897265338\" target=_blank> AI-generated video</a> that takes viewers on a dreamlike journey through an alternate-reality version of the Gaza Strip, remade according to his proposal for the United States to \u201cown\u201d the territory.\nIn the video, children emerge from a tunnel into an enclave of resorts and skyscrapers, including gold-trimmed hotels labeled \u201cTrump Gaza.\u201d The montage \u2014 suffused with the hallucinatory incongruities typical of viral, AI-generated clips \u2014 shows Trump sunbathing shirtless with his Israeli counterpart, bearded belly dancers on the beach, and Elon Musk eating hummus.\n\u201cNo more tunnels, no more fear. Trump Gaza is finally here,\u201d a voice sings to an electronic dance beat. \u201cTrump Gaza, shining bright. Golden future, a brand-new life.\u201d\nTrump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/trump-netanyahu-meeting/\" target=_blank>proposed</a> that the United States take over Gaza, permanently removing more than 2 million residents from the Palestinian territory and settling them elsewhere. He has also said he wants to develop the war-torn territory under U.S. control, asserting that Gaza could become the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d His plan has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/05/gaza-displacement-trump-palestinians/\" target=_blank>prompted outrage and swift rejection</a> from Palestinians and their Arab allies in the region.\nThe 33-second video begins by showing AI-generated clips of Palestinians walking through rubble in Gaza and then flashes an all-caps red, white and blue<b> </b>title caption asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d\nIt features AI-generated shots of a massive gold statue of Trump towering over a traffic circle, a toddler holding a large gold balloon of Trump\u2019s head and bazaar-like gift shops lined with Trump figurines. <b> </b>In several scenes, dollar bills fall from the sky, including over a suit-clad Musk dancing on the beach.\nThe White House did not respond to questions about who produced the video and how Trump obtained it to share on his Truth Social account and on Instagram. In a statement, Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, reiterated Trump\u2019s stated goal of wanting to take over the Gaza Strip and resettle Palestinians.\n\u201cAs President Trump has said, Gaza in its current state is unhabitable for any human being,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cPresident Trump is a visionary, and his plan to have the United States involved in Gaza\u2019s rebuilding will allow for Palestinians to resettle in new, beautiful communities while improving conditions in the region for generations to come.\u201d\nTrump has given mixed answers about whether Palestinians would be permitted to return to Gaza as part of his plan for the United States to take ownership of the territory and rebuild it. He said that Palestinians and \u201cmany people\u201d would be able to live in Gaza when he first announced his plan earlier this month. Days later, in an<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368595455112\" target=_blank> interview</a> with Fox News, he described his vision as \u201ca real estate development for the future\u201d and said he would own it \u2014 and that Palestinians would settle in permanent housing elsewhere.\nTrump\u2019s proposal has been broadly condemned as tantamount to ethnic cleansing. Leaders from Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/21/trump-gaza-arab-saudi-arabia/\" target=_blank>scrambling</a> to put together an alternative plan for Gaza.\nOn Wednesday morning, critics of the president took to social media to slam his posting of the video, with many describing it as callous and disturbing.\n\u201cThe video advocating for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza published on President Trump\u2019s social media is not only arrogant and disrespectful, but also violates international law and human rights,\u201d said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian opposition politician in the West Bank, in a statement.\nEven on his own platform, Truth Social, some viewers found the video strange or distasteful. Among the trending comments was one calling it \u201cin very bad taste and just plain horrible!!\u201d Another said: \u201cThis was weird for me and I love you Trump- This should be deleted.\u201d Several top comments said the gold statue in Gaza in particular was \u201cfrightening\u201d and \u201c100% wrong.\u201d\nIsmail al-Thawabta, head of the Hamas government media office in Gaza, condemned the video \u201cin the harshest terms,\u201d calling it \u201cdegrading.\u201d He said Palestinians will not allow any force to \u201cimpose a reality\u201d that contradicts their identity \u2014 \u201ceven if that force is the United States.\u201d\nBasem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019s political bureau, said in a statement that Trump was \u201conce again proposing ideas and solutions that do not take into account the cultures and interests\u201d of Palestinians. \u201cOur goal is not to improve our prison conditions but to get rid of the prison and the jailer,\u201d Naim said, adding that Palestinians must first be enabled to establish their state before any building occurs."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:18:22"}
