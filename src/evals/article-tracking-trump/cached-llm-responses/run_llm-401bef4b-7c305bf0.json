Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nLayoffs to hit IRS as DOGE targets tax collections\nThe Trump administration is expected to begin laying off thousands of employees at the Internal Revenue Service, six people briefed on the matter said, as billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s team begins to target tax collections.\nTreasury officials have discussed laying off roughly 9,000 employees still in their probationary period as part of broader dismissals across the government of recently hired workers, according to the six people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal conversations. That number could not be immediately confirmed, and spokespeople both for the IRS and Treasury declined to comment. The cuts could start as soon as Friday.\nThe layoffs are likely targeting tax collection, several of the people briefed on the matter said. Indeed, associates of Musk\u2019s team are beginning to meet with high-ranking IRS officials about what could prove dramatic changes to the tax agency. Gavin Kliger, a software engineer now working at the IRS, met with Ken Corbin, the IRS\u2019s chief of taxpayer services, and Heather Maloy, the agency\u2019s top enforcement official, during his first day at the agency\u2019s headquarters Thursday, according to several of the people familiar with the meetings.\nRepublicans have long aimed to shrink the tax agency and were particularly incensed by the Biden administration\u2019s push to hire thousands of new IRS agents to increase tax enforcement and collections. The cuts to federal personnel are likely to weaken the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to bolster the IRS, though to what extent remains uncertain.\nThe tax agency grew by about 10 percent last year, as its ranks swelled from roughly 90,000 employees in fiscal year 2023 to 100,000 employees this fiscal year. The IRS has said publicly that personnel critical to the tax filing season are ineligible for the \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d plan that encouraged federal personnel to quit. That has fueled speculation that the cuts to IRS personnel will be concentrated among the agency\u2019s tax collection staff, which could reduce the amount of revenue brought into federal coffers even as Musk calls for a reduced deficit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite distressing, because the Biden administration made serious efforts to bolster enforcement. I think all of that is in jeopardy now,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, who served as a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. \u201cStripping the IRS of resources is a windfall for those who like to game the system, and those are the most sophisticated and richest taxpayers.\u201d\nCongressional Republicans are likely to welcome DOGE\u2019s changes to the IRS. On Thursday, Rep. Jason T. Smith (R-Missouri), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, wrote a letter to IRS\u2019s acting commissioner blasting the $80 billion funding increase for the tax agency, among other measures.\n\u201cPresident Trump has shown in his first three weeks that he meant what he said during the presidential campaign. Our government has not been working effectively for the American people, and it needs to change,\u201d Smith\u2019s letter states.\nCongress had given <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/06/inflation-reduction-act-irs/\" target=\"_blank\">the IRS $80 billion</a> over 10 years through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, but<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/26/irs-funding-cut-20-billion-shutdown/\" target=\"_blank\"> Congress rescinded $20 billion</a> of that.\nWithin the agency, the impending job cuts are being met with dread, both for individuals and the health of the tax system. The vast majority of Treasury employees work for the IRS.\nIRS employees cheered the Biden administration\u2019s funding boosts, which yielded almost immediate performance and IT improvements. Now rolling those back \u2014 and cutting thousands of freshly hired employees \u2014 could send the agency into a tailspin in the middle of filing season.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like going off a cliff immediately,\u201d said David Carrone, a revenue agent and president of the Louisiana-Arkansas National Treasury Employees Union chapter.\n<i>Isaac Arnsdorf contributed to this report.</i>"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:37:24"}
