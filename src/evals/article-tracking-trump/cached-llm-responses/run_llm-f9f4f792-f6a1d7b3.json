Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nWith one last stop, Bullis is too much and makes it three straight IAC titles\nAdrien Stevens watched the frenzy unfold from his backside.\nAfter tumbling to the court while fighting for a rebound on the final play of the Interstate Athletic Conference championship game, the Marquette-bound conference player of the year remained seated as Bullis students stormed from the bleachers to meet the Bulldogs at midcourt. When Stevens got to his feet, he avoided the scrum as he walked to the scorers\u2019 table to join a developing handshake line.\nWhen he arrived, he had just one question: \u201cWhere\u2019s that trophy at?\u201d\nSaturday\u2019s 55-53 win over Georgetown Prep in Potomac required every ounce of effort Stevens and his Bullis teammates could muster. They were pushed by the talented Little Hoyas (14-13) for the full 32 minutes, but the result granted the Bulldogs (20-7) a continuation of their recent dominance: For the third consecutive season, they claimed the IAC regular season and tournament titles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really special to be a part of something like this,\u201d said Stevens, a senior guard who led his team with 16 points. \u201cBullis has changed my life, so I\u2019m just glad I could be a part of putting three banners up on the wall.\u201d\nAfter trailing 14-3 behind early sharpshooting from Georgetown Prep senior guard Patrick McDonough, the game\u2019s top scorer with 17 points, Bullis had to regroup. The Bulldogs played a rigorous nonconference schedule, at times taking their lumps in the name of preparing for these moments. They contended with injuries and roster turnover, relying on new leaders to prosper and younger pieces to blossom. Each time, the Bulldogs answered the call. A 14-4 run to end the first quarter was Saturday\u2019s answer.\n\u201cThere are times when being a high school basketball coach is the best job in America, and knowing what these boys have been through, just staying together and trusting me, it\u2019s just a great feeling,\u201d Bullis\u2019s Bruce Kelley said.\nFrom the second quarter on, the game felt destined to come down to the final shot \u2014 and it did. Georgetown Prep had possession with eight seconds left, trailing by two. The ball worked its way to five feet beyond the top of the key. The final seconds were ticking off the clock, and the Hoyas\u2019 attempt was on the way to the rim. Kelley could have sworn it was going in.\nBut the shot bounced off the iron, and the game was over. Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d soon blared from the gym\u2019s speakers. The Bulldogs wouldn\u2019t dare tempt the basketball gods by practicing the ritual beforehand, meaning they finally could climb a stepladder to cut down the nets.\n\u201cThat was the greatest feeling I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d freshman Xavier Skipworth said. \u201cCoach always says we have to be a fist and not separate fingers. We knew they were going to punch hard, but we just had to stick together. We just did that.\u201d"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 10:54:03"}
