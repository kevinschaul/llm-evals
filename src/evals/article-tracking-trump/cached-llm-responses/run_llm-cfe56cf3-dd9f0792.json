Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nTrump plans emerge to use U.S. military bases for immigrant detention\nA Space Force military base in Colorado will serve as a detention center for immigrant detainees facing deportation, Defense Department officials said Wednesday.\nIn a statement, military officials said facilities would be provided at Buckley Space Force Base for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u201cto stage and process criminal aliens.\u201d The site will be operated by ICE officials and other federal law enforcement agencies, not the U.S. military, according to U.S. Northern Command. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem said during an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News that  the Trump administration might use Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base in Cuba to house deportees whose home countries won\u2019t take them back.\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to take on a larger role in U.S. border security and immigration enforcement. Military officials are sending 1,500 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and have prepared to send 10,000. Deportation flights carrying detainees to Guatemala, Colombia and Ecuador in C-17 military transport planes have departed from border areas carrying recent migrants caught attempting to enter the United States.\nICE has the capacity to hold about 40,000 detainees nationwide  in private jails and county facilities where the agency rents beds. Those facilities are nearly full, ICE officials say, and the agency has taken thousands of detainees into custody since Trump took office last week and launched a mass deportation campaign. The use of military bases has raised concerns among ICE officials and immigrant advocates regarding the use of barracks that do not meet detention and safety standards for secure facilities.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:29:44"}
