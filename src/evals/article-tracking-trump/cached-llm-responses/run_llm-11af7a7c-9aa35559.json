{"args": ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "\nDoes this describe a specific, new, official action or formal announcement already taken/made by the Trump administration? Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nTrump ramps up ICE arrests, alarming cities and immigrant communities\nThe deportation blitz President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail kicked off in U.S. cities this week, delighting many of his supporters and jolting communities where immigration officers appeared \u2014 or whose arrival was merely rumored, sending a chill nonetheless.\nTrump\u2019s executive orders have given immigration officers extraordinary new powers to cast a wider net and fast-track deportations. The president has scrapped restrictions that kept \u201csensitive\u201d locations like churches and schools off-limits for immigration officers. Social media posts and school mailing lists have lit up with possible officer sightings, including many false alarms.\nThe number of suspects arrested \u2014 several hundred per day nationwide<b> </b>\u2014 has been outpaced by the psychological impact of the attention on ICE operations.\nIn Boston, a Fox News crew broadcast<b> </b>live as officers knocked on doors and pulled suspects from homes. In other cities where ICE netted a smattering of arrests, immigrant advocacy groups and Democratic representatives denounced \u201craids\u201d that gave an impression of something larger. Chicago officials said ICE officers tried to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/01/24/immigration-ice-agents-visit-chicago-school/\" target=_blank>access an elementary school</a>, but the agency said it wasn\u2019t true.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going very well. We\u2019re getting the bad, hard criminals out,\u201d Trump said, speaking to reporters during a trip to North Carolina to view the flood recovery from Hurricane Helene.\nWithout evidence, he said: \u201cThese are murderers. These are people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as anybody you\u2019ve seen. We\u2019re taking them out first.\u201d\nIt is a sharp break from the Biden administration, which protected most undocumented immigrants from being deported and welcomed thousands of temporary new arrivals via a program called parole. This week the top Department of Homeland Security official issued a memo directing agents to consider swiftly deporting people the Biden administration allowed to enter.\nThe Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants waiting in Mexico to request asylum through the CBP One mobile app. Trump\u2019s efforts are likely to face legal challenges, but lawyers say immigrants are not entitled to public defenders and therefore will have a difficult time defending themselves in a fast-track process, especially if they are detained. Earlier in the week, Trump officials abruptly halted some contracts that provided legal guidance to detainees.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday night that ICE had made 538 arrests that day, and officials said Friday they arrested 593 more. She wrote that four of those arrested in the sweeps were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Others had committed sex crimes against children, Leavitt said.\nLeavitt posted photos Friday showing U.S. troops loading shackled detainees onto a military cargo plane for a flight to Guatemala.\n\u201cThe largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway,\u201d Leavitt wrote on X on Thursday.\n\u201cDeportation flights have begun. President Trump is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: if you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences,\u201d Leavitt later added.\nThe military flew two C-17 cargo planes, each carrying approximately 80 people, to Guatemala after they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, according to a DHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operations. The flights departed from Texas and Arizona, officials said. ICE Air is continuing to operate deportation flights alongside military planes, officials said.\nTom Cartwright, who tracks ICE deportations for the immigrant advocacy group Witness at the Border, called the military operation \u201ctheater of the absurd\u201d in a post on X. \u201cThe only thing new about this is subjecting people to transport on a cargo plane,\u201d Cartwright wrote. He noted that ICE carried out 508 deportation flights to Guatemala during the 2024 fiscal year on planes that averaged 125 passengers.\nTrump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan cited a higher number of ICE arrests<b> </b>than the White House on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73h1iNQ8XRk\" target=_blank>NewsNation</a> on Thursday night, saying officials had apprehended more than 3,000 people with criminal records in the first couple days of the administration. ICE, which detains and deports immigrants, did not respond to requests to clarify the numbers.\nTrump and his officials provided few details about those arrests or proof of their criminal records. Trump has long characterized immigrants as criminals, though studies show that native-born Americans commit a higher share of violent felonies.\nImmigration officials did not say precisely how many immigrants were deported as part of the nationwide operations that unfolded this week \u2014 or how many were criminals \u2014 but officials have said their main targets are serious offenders.\nTrump also conducted raids at the start of his first term, and had threatened to deport \u201cmillions\u201d of people, though he never came close to that number.\nThen, as now, officials said criminals were their top priority. Weeks later, however, congressional aides <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/ice-data-shows-half-of-immigrants-arrested-in-raids-had-traffic-convictions-or-no-record/2017/04/28/81ff7284-2c59-11e7-b605-33413c691853_story.html\" target=_blank>discovered </a>that half of those arrested had no criminal convictions or had committed traffic offenses as their most serious crimes, which ICE said were mostly for drunken driving.\nThe immigration sweeps hit immediately after Trump took office in cities and states across the country, targeting areas where Democrats have defended immigrants and urged Congress to grant them a path to U.S. citizenship. Trump has called for their mass removal, and on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/20/trump-immigration-executive-orders/\" target=_blank>Inauguration Day </a>he directed the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense to prioritize immigration enforcement.\nHoman, a former acting ICE director and Fox News analyst, said in an appearance Thursday on Fox News that agents were arresting people in sanctuary cities, where local officials refuse to allow agents to arrest immigrants in their jails after police have picked them up for alleged crimes.\nMany local officials say they cannot keep someone in jail for a civil immigration violation after a judge has ordered the person released on bail in a criminal case. And some have expressed frustration that ICE targets minor offenders, making the broader community afraid to report crimes to police.\nTrump officials have called for rescinding federal funding to those cities and have threatened to prosecute any officials who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/22/justice-immigrantion-memo-sanctuary-cities/\" target=_blank>obstruct </a>immigration officers.\n\u201cSanctuary cities make it less efficient and more dangerous, but it\u2019s not going to stop us,\u201d Homan <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6367588473112\" target=_blank>said</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re hitting every sanctuary city right now.\u201d\nActing Homeland Security secretary Benjamine C. Huffman on Jan. 20 rescinded a directive that discouraged ICE from making arrests in sensitive areas such as churches or schools. He also ended the broad use of humanitarian parole, which President Joe Biden used to admit thousands of temporary migrants from Cuba, Haiti and other countries.\nOn Thursday, Huffman went further, directing immigration officials to consider stripping an undetermined number of migrants of parole and placing them in fast-track removal proceedings. Huffman declared that there was a \u201cmass influx\u201d of migrants at the southern border, despite a sharp reduction in apprehensions in recent months.\nUnless they are \u201cclearly\u201d eligible to enter, Huffman said all migrants should be detained until they are deported or granted asylum.\nIn Newark, Mayor Ras A. Baraka said Thursday that ICE raided a local business, detaining undocumented residents and U.S. citizens \u201cwithout producing a warrant.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned,\u201d the mayor said in a statement. He said federal agents violated the veteran\u2019s rights. \u201cNewark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,\u201d Baraka added.\nICE declined to provide detailed answers about the allegations, saying the investigation is ongoing.\nBut spokesman Jeff Carter said in an email that agents \u201cmay encounter U.S. citizens while conducting field work and may request identification to establish an individual\u2019s identity,\u201d which is what happened in Newark.\nICE has arrested immigrants, particularly criminals, across every administration, and the Biden administration boasted that it was aggressively pursuing serious offenders. Days before  Biden left office, <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ero-newark-arrests-33-criminal-noncitizens-week-long-surge-operation\" target=\"_blank\">ICE said it had arrested 33 criminal noncitizens</a> in a week-long operation in December, also in Newark.\nAs of July 21, ICE said it was tracking nearly 650,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal records who had been released into the United States, though only 425,000 had convictions. The others were pending trial.\nMany are serving criminal sentences in state prisons or jails, while others are minor offenders who had been spared removal under the Biden administration. Trump has said any of the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the United States illegally could be deported.\nIn the D.C. area, the volunteer group Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network launched a hotline Monday for area residents to call if they believe they see ICE officers in public. The group has not confirmed any wide-scale raids or enforcement actions this week, but the phones have kept ringing, said Amy Fischer, one of the group\u2019s organizers.\n\u201cWhat is really clear is that people are just terrified,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cIt really seems like any time there is an unmarked cop car or something that looks like a cop car, people call. \u2026 It describes the overall moment or atmosphere that we are living in.\u201d\nIn Montgomery County, Maryland, county officials said ICE agents arrested an immigrant with a felony in Gaithersburg on Thursday. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for information about the arrest, but it sparked fears of broader immigration sweeps at a local shopping center and high school. Similar rumors have swept across the county since Trump took office.\nSome residents have confused local law enforcement for ICE agents, said Earl Stoddard, an assistant chief administrative officer in Montgomery County, a sign of locals\u2019 anxieties that their neighborhood could be the agency\u2019s next target.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been every day this week,\u201d Stoddard said Thursday. \u201cPeople calling in worrying about ICE. This was the first time it was real.\u201d\n<i>Jacqueline Alemany, Arelis R.
