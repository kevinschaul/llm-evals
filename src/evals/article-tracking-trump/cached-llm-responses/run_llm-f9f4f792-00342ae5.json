{"args": ["gemini-2.0-flash", "Is this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump signs executive order seeking more death sentences\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-the-death-penalty-and-protecting-public-safety/\" target=\"_blank\">executive order</a> directing the attorney general to seek the death penalty much more often and to encourage local and state prosecutors do to the same.\nTrump also took aim at his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/12/23/biden-death-penalty-commutation/\" target=_blank>commuting the sentences</a> last month of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. Biden commuted their sentences to life in prison without parole. While Trump cannot undo those commutations, he raised the possibility that his administration could encourage local officials to seek new death sentences for them.\nWriting in the order, Trump directed his attorney general to examine whether those people could be charged with state-level capital crimes and then \u201crecommend appropriate action to state and local authorities.\u201d\nIn addition to broadly requesting that the Justice Department seek more federal death sentences, Trump directed the attorney general to seek death \u201cfor every federal capital crime\u201d in which a law enforcement officer is murdered or the defendant is in the country illegally.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, the Justice Department restarted executions and carried out 13, including some in the days leading up to Biden\u2019s inauguration. Under Biden, the Justice Department imposed a moratorium blocking new executions, but prosecutors also continued to seek new death sentences.\nBiden\u2019s action commuting sentences last month left three men on federal death row: the surviving Boston Marathon bomber; the Charleston, South Carolina, church gunman; and the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman, who was prosecuted and sentenced to death during Biden\u2019s term.\nTrump has long been a vocal supporter of the death penalty. Capital punishment\u2019s use nationwide has waned in recent decades, with executions and new death sentences plummeting. A Washington Post examination <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2024/death-row-inmates-us-executions/\" target=_blank>last year</a> found that many of the 2,100 people on death row appeared likely to die there without being executed.\nOfficials in some states have not sought to carry out executions, but in other cases, authorities say they have struggled to obtain the drugs needed for lethal injections. Trump\u2019s order also directs his attorney general to make sure that states with the death penalty have the necessary drugs for lethal injections."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 10:51:11"}
