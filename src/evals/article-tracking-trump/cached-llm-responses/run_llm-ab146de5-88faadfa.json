{"args": ["claude-3.7-sonnet", "\nIs this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump set to pull funding from schools based on race, gender teaching\nThe White House is preparing to issue a trio of executive orders on education, including one directing the Education Department to withhold federal funding from any school that teaches about \u201cradical gender ideology\u201d or \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d officials said Wednesday.\nThe order instructs the secretary of education to present a strategy to achieve this within 90 days, according to a summary.\nA second order promotes school choice options, including an attempt to help states use federal funding for private-school voucher programs. The third order seeks to combat antisemitism in schools.\nFor years, Republicans including President Donald Trump have attacked schools for teaching a basket of ideas about systemic racism labeled critical race theory. Trump has also attacked schools for policies and lessons that recognize and respect transgender students.\nFederal law allows the agency to withhold federal funds from any school that discriminates based on race. Trump and his allies argue that lessons about systemic racism amount to discrimination, because they presume certain things about people based on race, such as that White Americans enjoy certain privileges based on their race. They say that giving rights to transgender students, especially transgender girls and women, discriminates against cisgender girls and women by forcing them to share spaces and sports teams.\nThe order also reinstates the<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/02/trump-1776-commission-education/\" target=_blank> 1776 Commission</a>, which Trump created just a week before the 2020 presidential election to promote \u201cpatriotic education.\u201d The commission wrote a report that was published in the final days of his first term. The report came under heavy fire from historians as a distortion of American history, and President Joe Biden disbanded the panel as one of his first acts. As a candidate, Trump promised to reinstate the commission if reelected.\n<i>Cleve R. Wootson Jr. contributed to this report.</i>\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:03:07"}
