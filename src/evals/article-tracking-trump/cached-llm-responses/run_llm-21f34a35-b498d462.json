Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nNew database gives public easy access to 3D primate skeletons\nA new <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3dprimates\" target=_blank>database</a> offers access to over 6,000 3D scans of primate skeletons housed in the American Museum of Natural History, Stony Brook University, the National Museum of Natural History, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium, researchers announced.\nHosted on MorphoSource, an online repository of world heritage and natural history data, the resource contains nearly 400 digitized adult primates, including great apes (orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees) and monkeys from Africa, Asia and South America. The scans include everything from hands to feet to skulls, and most animals are represented by near-complete skeletons.\nThe database was designed to help those in the field of phenomics \u2014 the study of animals\u2019 physical characteristics. Studying primate characteristics requires accessing their skeletons \u2014 some of which may be hard to study because of distance, financial resources or concerns about the specimens themselves.\n\u201cOne of our concerns for the primate collection, which is very heavily used, has always been wear and tear of the specimens,\u201d Nancy Simmons, curator in charge of the American Museum of Natural History\u2019s mammalogy department, said in a news <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/primate-digital-collections\" target=_blank>release</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen different sets of researchers measuring and scanning the same items again and again. Being able to share these 3D scans with researchers around the world is huge and reduces possible damage to the collection items.\u201d\nSimmons and her co-authors described the collection in a December <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-04261-5\" target=_blank>paper</a> in Scientific Data. They say it is the largest 3D morphological dataset of its kind in primates.\n\u201cOpen data sharing is essential to equal advancement in all fields of science,\u201d they write, noting that 3D scanning of important specimens is often an on-demand process provided to individuals. Making the collection freely available, they write, will enable more comprehensive research and could advance the study of human origins, which is closely linked to that of primate evolution.\nWant to take a look at the data?
