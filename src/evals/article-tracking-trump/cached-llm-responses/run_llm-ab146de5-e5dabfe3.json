{"args": ["claude-3.7-sonnet", "\nDoes this describe a specific, new, official action or formal announcement already taken/made by the Trump administration? Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nTrump freezes hiring for many federal jobs\nThe White House issued a freeze on the hiring of civilian employees across the government Monday night, exempting active-duty military personnel and positions related to immigration enforcement, national security and public safety. The order also prohibits the use of outside contractors to get around the freeze, a strategy used by previous administrations to maneuver around hiring caps.\nThe order also appears to open the door for the permanent federal personnel reductions that President Donald Trump campaigned on. Within 90 days, the administration is directed to come up with plans to \u201creduce the size of the Federal Government\u2019s workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition.\u201d Then the hiring freeze will be lifted.\nThe exception is the Internal Revenue Service. The freeze will remain in place there until Trump officials \u201cdetermine that it is in the national interest\u201d to lift it.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:14:02"}
