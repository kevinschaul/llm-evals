{"args": ["openai/gpt-4.1-mini", "\nDoes this describe a specific, new, official action or formal announcement already taken/made by the Trump administration? Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nMoore hardens criticism of Trump after \u2018conspiracy theories and attacks\u2019\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) on Monday took a hardened stance toward what he described as a \u201cfull crisis situation\u201d manufactured by the still-new Trump administration, a shift in tone after months of careful political maneuvering to preserve any cooperation that the deep-blue state could get from the federal government.\nMoore had greeted President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in November by saying he wanted to work to find <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/08/maryland-governor-wes-moore-trump/\" target=_blank>\u201ccommon ground\u201d</a> with the incoming president, as long as he could also protect the interests of Maryland residents.\nOver the past five weeks, he said, that goal has increasingly seemed unattainable, and on Monday he accused Trump of \u201ckicking children off of Medicaid so we can make space in the budget for tax cuts for billionaires.\u201d\nIn a response to Moore\u2019s criticisms, the White House struck back at Democrats who have slammed the recent cuts to federal jobs and spending under the guidance of the Elon Musk-led U.S. DOGE Service, also known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\u201cThe Democrats have no plan on how to recover from their embarrassing loss, and it shows,\u201d White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in an email. \u201cInstead of working to become a party that focuses on the will of the people, they are hell-bent on keeping their heads in the sand and gaslighting on the widely supported mission of DOGE.\u201d\nTrump last week appointed Moore to the bipartisan Council of Governors, which works to strengthen state and federal partnerships on national security, disaster response and military coordination.\nMoore attended a meeting of governors from across the country in D.C. on Friday. Moore said Republican and Democratic governors had productive and interesting conversations about policy. When Trump showed up, Moore said, it became clear that he did not intend to listen to the state leaders.\n\u201cWhen the president of the United States walked into the room, that\u2019s when things went off the rails,\u201d he said.\nTrump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/22/janet-mills-maine-trump-transgender-athletes/\" target=_blank>clashed with the Democratic governor of Maine</a> over an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/05/transgender-students-trump-executive-order/\" target=_blank>executive order</a> that bans transgender athletes from competing on girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports teams, and he threatened to withhold all federal funding from the state if it does not comply. Moore described the president\u2019s remarks as \u201can hour-long diatribe of conspiracy theories and attacks on my colleagues.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve come back from these meetings with all of our nation\u2019s governors \u2026 with a full-blown understanding that this is a full crisis situation,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for all of us to take this moment seriously.\u201d\nAlready facing a $3 billion budget deficit, Maryland stands to lose a lot amid the administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal government and reduce spending.\nThe state is home to many federal workers who have either lost their jobs in recent weeks or are in danger of losing them amid the Trump administration\u2019s spending cuts. Government contractors and nonprofits who depend on federal grants are also laying off workers and closing shop.\nOther changes being contemplated by the administration and a Republican-controlled Congress would further devastate Maryland\u2019s economy, Moore said. Those actions could soon include <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/18/medicaid-cuts-work-requirements-congress-republicans/8f3a7244-edf0-11ef-bd80-8f2ac5c75a8a_story.html\" target=_blank>cuts to Medicaid</a>, reductions in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and a full shutdown of the federal government that would leave tens of thousands of Marylanders temporarily out of work, he said. The governor said he left D.C. on Friday with the feeling that the Trump administration relishes the potential fallout from those decisions.\n\u201cNot only is this going to continue; they are going to accelerate,\u201d Moore said.\nFor months, Moore and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/governors-trump-whitmer-mills-transgender-musk-tariffs/faebeb86-f22c-11ef-acb5-08900d482a27_story.html\" target=_blank>other Democratic leaders</a> have been trying to navigate the tension between protecting whatever federal resources they can get for their states and voicing their concerns about the president\u2019s words and actions.\nMoore<b> </b>was photographed in December smiling and shaking hands with Trump at the Army-Navy football game, a gesture to show good faith.\nBy the time Moore gave his State of the State address early this month, his rhetoric had begun to shift. He didn\u2019t name Trump, but he lamented the \u201cuncertainty, confusion and chaos\u201d of the first few weeks of the new administration.\nLess than a month after that speech, Moore on Monday shared doubts that a partnership can exist between the deeply blue state and the Trump White House.\nMoore said governors in both parties were willing to work together on some issues, especially to build a strong economy, but Trump did not engage in the bipartisan conversation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody, either Democrat or Republican, could walk away from what happened this weekend and say that same measure of cohesion existed between our nation\u2019s governors and the White House,\u201d he said.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:02:45"}
