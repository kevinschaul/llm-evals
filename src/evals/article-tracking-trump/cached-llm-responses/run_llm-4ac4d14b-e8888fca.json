Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nBystander shot during robbery attempt at Waterfront Metro\nA bystander was shot and wounded inside the Waterfront Metro station in Southwest Washington on Tuesday night during a robbery attempt, according to a Metro spokeswoman.\nThe woman, who was an accidental victim, was taken to a hospital with what appeared to be injuries that were not life-threatening, the spokeswoman said.\nThe station, at 4th and M streets, is within two or three blocks of some of the city\u2019s premier after-dark attractions, including the Arena Stage and the Wharf dining, residential and retail development.\nIt is east of the Maine Avenue waterfront, for which it is named.\nJust before the shooting, which occurred a few minutes after 9 p.m., five people were involved in an attempted robbery on the mezzanine level of the station, according to the spokeswoman.\nDuring the attempt, shots were fired and a bullet ricocheted and struck the woman.\n\nThe mezzanine level is between the street level entrance and the train platform. At the time of the gunfire, a special police officer, who was assigned to the station, was on the platform, the spokeswoman said.\nIn the District, special police are security guards who are authorized to carry firearms at sites where they are on duty. The officer heard the shots and notified Metro\u2019s transit police department.\nThe hiring of special police to reinforce Metro\u2019s own police department and bolster safety was reported two years ago.\nFour \u201cpersons of interest\u201d were stopped in the incident, the transit spokeswoman said. No arrests were reported and the four were not identified.\nThe station was closed and trains ran through it without stopping, according to the spokeswoman. It was not clear how many people may have seen or heard any part of the incident.\nIt apparently occurred shortly before theater patrons left the Arena after Tuesday night\u2019s show. The Arena, on Sixth Street, is about two blocks from the scene of the incident.\nAccording to information published online, the show, Sarah Silverman\u2019s musical \u201cThe Bedwetter,\u201d was scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. and run until about 9:10 p.m.\nMetro described the investigation of the incident Tuesday night as active, and photographs showed the flashing lights of police vehicles clustered in the area."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:58:26"}
