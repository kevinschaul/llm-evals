Noem signaled Wednesday morning that the Trump administration is considering using the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention camp to house undocumented immigrants whom officials are seeking to deport.\nAsked directly whether Guant\u00e1namo Bay was an option for sending undocumented immigrants apprehended by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Noem told Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox &amp; Friends\u201d that President Donald Trump and his administration are looking at all their options for expelling people who are in the United States illegally, particularly those from countries that do not currently accept deportees, such as Venezuela and Cuba.\n\u201cWe\u2019re evaluating and talking about that right now. It\u2019s the president\u2019s decision, but it\u2019s an asset, and we\u2019re going to continue to look at how we can use all of our assets to keep America safe,\u201d Noem said.\nGuant\u00e1namo Bay is known for its military prison within the naval base on the coast of Cuba, where suspected terrorists have been held in the years since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It also has a separate migrant processing facility, which the Biden administration used to process some asylum seekers.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 09:48:49"}
