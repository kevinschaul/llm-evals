Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nAt forum, Bowser won\u2019t rule out public funds for NFL stadium at RFK\nOn Thursday night, before a packed auditorium at Eastern Senior High School, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) made it clear once again: She wants the Washington Commanders to build its next NFL home at the site of RFK Stadium, and she\u2019s not ruling out a public subsidy to help them do it.\nBowser called a football stadium \u201cthe fastest and surest route to developing the site,\u201d a 177-acre swath of land on the banks of the Anacostia River that the city recently secured<b> </b>control of after years of negotiations in Congress.\n\u201cUntil we have a modern stadium, we will not be able to host events like the world is used to, including a World Cup, including a Super Bowl \u2014 and yes, Beyonc\u00e9<b> </b>and Taylor Swift,\u201d said Bowser.\nThe mayor\u2019s remarks came at her largest public forum on the RFK development since the city secured control of the federal<b> </b>land\u2019s destiny. The stadium was left to crumble for years because of a restrictive lease that did not allow commercial development \u2014 but after a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/12/25/rfk-stadium-bill-dc-bowser/\" target=_blank>Christmas miracle of sorts in Congress</a>, D.C. is permitted to develop<b> </b>the site for multiple uses.\nBowser said she plans to work with the Commanders, who now play in Landover, Maryland, to convince them D.C. is the best location and reach terms that she believes will benefit residents. Her administration will also propose plans for the rest of the site \u2014 which could include housing, a large indoor sportsplex run by the city\u2019s parks and recreation department, and other commercial development, Bowser said.<b> </b>Commanders principal owner Josh Harris has avoided expressing an outright preference for the new stadium location, which will likely go in D.C. or Maryland, but he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/21/commanders-rfk-stadium/\" target=_blank>called RFK the \u201cspiritual home\u201d</a> of the Commanders, took a photo with Bowser at the signing of the RFK bill at the White House, and has said D.C. is the most politically viable site.\nBut Bowser\u2019s vision is likely to face intense scrutiny from a divided D.C. Council and their constituents, who are not all convinced that an NFL stadium would be a good bet for city taxpayers. And in this case, city lawmakers have leverage: Any plan using public dollars will have to go through them. The question of whether taxpayer money will help fund a football stadium \u2014 and if so, how much \u2014 is shaping up to be one of<b> </b>this year\u2019s<b> </b>largest political battles in the District.\nThe line to get into Eastern snaked around the block as residents waited for the chance to hear the mayor make her case \u2014 and answer more than an hour\u2019s worth of their questions. People passed out fliers, printed with the words \u201cCOMMUNITY FIRST AT RFK\u201d and \u201cNO BILLIONAIRE\u2019S PLAYGROUND.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see a stadium,\u201d said Leslie Fields, 64, who has lived in D.C. for four decades. 'We\u2019ve got people sitting in the streets. There\u2019s a lot of things that we need to pay for. We don\u2019t have a billion dollars lying around.\u201d\nDuring her 20-minute presentation, Bowser argued that an NFL stadium \u2014 particularly one surrounded by housing, retail and other recreation opportunities \u2014 would<b> </b>bring jobs and tax revenue<b> </b>to the city. To support her argument, she cited a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/13/dc-sports-study-rfk-stadium-commanders/\" target=_blank>sports study she commissioned and released last year</a> that estimated more than $1 billion in annual economic output could come from a mixed-use development with an NFL stadium. She assured residents that she envisioned much more than football at the site. With a parcel of this size, she said,<b> </b>\u201cwe can indeed do it all.\u201d\nSome<b> </b>residents were all for it.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just build a stadium \u2014 Super Bowl status!\u201d one said.\nMany had more tempered enthusiasm or outright skepticism. Neighboring<b> </b>Kingman Park residents wanted assurances they would not be displaced from their homes; Bowser promised they would not. Others wanted guaranteed opportunities for small local business owners at the site, assurances that care would be taken to avoid negative environmental impacts and promises that city leaders would be thoughtful about traffic. Skateboarders asked to be considered, hoping they wouldn\u2019t be displaced from one of the few good places to skate in the city. A team of young pole-vaulting champions who practice nearby asked for the same.\nSeveral focused on parking. How much space would NFL stadium parking requirements actually eat up? While Bowser estimated a stadium would take up 20 to 25 acres, she would not provide an estimate for parking space.\nOthers focused on public funding. Why fund a stadium, they asked, when the city still struggles in some cases to deliver basic resident services?\nAsked by one man whether she would commit to not offering the NFL team a subsidy, Bowser\u2019s answer was unequivocal: \u201cNo.\u201d\nBowser\u2019s presentation did not offer details about how much public money she would be willing to offer the team, only saying that her administration\u2019s \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d found that a stadium would be a good investment. But some<b> </b>wanted more details about the mayor\u2019s economic argument, feeling uncertain that taxpayers would benefit.\nSome economists argue there is consensus that sports stadiums do not pay off for cities: One <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/13/dc-sports-study-rfk-stadium-commanders/\" target=_blank>told The Washington Post last year</a> that he did not even want to go into the specifics of Bowser\u2019s sports study \u201cbecause I fear going into the details grants some legitimacy to the idea that there is some debate over the economic impact of stadiums.\u201d\nLast year, a<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/05/22/commanders-stadium-rfk-site-poll/\" target=_blank> Washington Post-Schar School poll</a> found that 47 percent of D.C. residents were in favor of city funds being used for an NFL stadium and 46 percent were opposed.\nD.C. Council members<b> </b>are divided, too.\nWard 2 council member Brooke Pinto (D) is shaping up to be a Bowser ally on this issue: She said last week that it was time to bring the Commanders to D.C., and that she was open to all funding options to do so \u2014 including public funding.\nBut at least five of the council\u2019s 12 current lawmakers \u2014 Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Janeese Lewis George (D-Ward 4), Zachary Parker (D-Ward 5), Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) and Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) \u2014 say they would oppose taxpayers footing the bill for a stadium. Nadeau opposes a stadium entirely, a spokesperson confirmed last week. And Allen is heavily skeptical, arguing that an NFL stadium and parking would mean sacrificing additional housing and commercial space with higher potential for full-time, year-round jobs. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re having an honest conversation about what the trade-offs are,\u201d he said in an interview last week.\nFive council members \u2014 Kenyan R. McDuffie (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Christina Henderson (I-At Large), Matt Frumin (D-Ward 3) and Wendell Felder (D-Ward 7) \u2014 either declined to commit to a position on public financing or did not respond.\nRobert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) said in a statement Friday that he did not think D.C. taxpayers should foot the bill but that it would be \u201cpremature\u201d to comment on financing for a stadium until he has seen the mayor\u2019s full proposal.\nFelder, whose ward includes the RFK area, sat onstage next to Bowser at Thursday night\u2019s forum. He<b> </b>spoke about a stadium as a possible economic boon for his constituents but later said he needed to see specifics before he\u2019d decide whether taxpayer money should help fund one.\n\u201cI don\u2019t deal in hypotheticals; I need to see a proposal,\u201d he<b> </b>said as he left.\nPenn Branch resident<b> </b>Jimmie Williams said he was generally supportive of an NFL stadium coming to D.C. \u2014 noting that D.C.'s loss would be another jurisdiction\u2019s gain. But he wanted to make sure any stadium deal was done with care and an eye toward residents\u2019 concerns.\n\u201cThis is an economic benefit for D.C.,\u201d said Williams. \u201cBut it\u2019s got to be done right.\u201d\n<i>Sam Fortier contributed to this report.</i>"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 10:40:10"}
