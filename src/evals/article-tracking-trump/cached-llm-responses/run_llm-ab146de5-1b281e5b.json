Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nSix girls, 11 to 14, arrested in assault outside Union Station\nA total of six girls, ages 11 to 14, have been arrested and charged in an \u201cegregious\u201d and apparently random attack on a woman by a group of youths outside Union Station, according to the D.C. police.\nTwo of the girls, ages 11 and 13, were arrested Thursday, the police said. The other four girls were arrested Friday, according to police. Their ages were similar to the first two: they were given as 11, 12, 13 and 14.\nThe first indication of a possible motive in the attack was given Friday. It may have been motivated by prejudice, the police said in a statement Friday night.\n\u201cDetectives\u2019 investigation revealed the suspects potentially being motivated by hate or bias,\u201d the statement said.\nAs a result, police said, all six suspects have been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon with an enhancement related to an alleged hate crime.\nThe type of prejudice was not specified. An earlier statement, reporting the first two arrests, said nothing about possible hate or bias or any other motive.\nAuthorities said one of the participants recorded and posted the assault on social media. One of the youths repeatedly kicked and punched the woman, dragged her by the hair \u201cand encouraged the other suspects to continue their attack,\u201d according to a police statement and a report.\nNo serious injuries were reported, police said Friday.\nThe incident occurred Sunday but was not reported to police, who said they learned of it Wednesday when they were alerted to videos on the internet. Police have said they were looking for as many as nine girls in the attack.\n\u201cThe actions of these young suspects are disturbing and deeply disheartening for all of us who care for the youngest people in our community,\u201d D.C Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said in a statement after the first two arrests. \u201cThere is absolutely zero tolerance for this behavior in our city. Harming our community like this will result in your arrest and prosecution, no matter your age.\u201d\nThe attack in Northeast Washington is reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/03/reggie-brown-teen-girls-sentenced-beating-fatal/\" target=\"_blank\">deadly assault</a> in 2023 by five girls ages 12 to 14 on Reginald \u201cReggie\u201d Brown, a frail and disabled 64-year-old man who had been on a stroll that his family said he took to cope with the strain of cancer treatments. One of the girls recorded the beating, and another testified in court that she and her friends had been \u201cbored\u201d and were looking for someone to beat up. All were found criminally responsible in juvenile court and sent to the city\u2019s youth rehabilitation agency.\nThat incident shocked authorities for its brutality and for the ages of its attackers. It occurred during a year in which violent crime soared in the District and when youths, as both victims and offenders, were of high concern.\nIn the attack outside Union Station on Massachusetts Avenue, the assailants assaulted bystanders who tried to intervene, police said. They said the first two girls were charged as juveniles with assault with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to riot, simple assault and disorderly conduct.\nIn addition to the assault charge, those located and arrested Friday were also charged with rioting, the police statement said.\nIn their original statement, police also said they were collaborating with counterparts in other jurisdictions to determine whether the youths could be connected to similar attacks elsewhere. Those other areas were not identified."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:05:34"}
