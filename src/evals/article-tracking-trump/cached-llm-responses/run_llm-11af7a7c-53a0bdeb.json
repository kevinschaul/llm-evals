Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nHUD moves to cancel $1.1 billion in already-awarded housing upgrades\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development, acting on a directive from DOGE, is moving to terminate more than $1.1 billion in loans and grants awarded to improve the energy efficiency and weather resilience of multifamily housing, according to a department official with knowledge of the order.\nThe termination of the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program puts into jeopardy more than 260 projects across the country, several of which have already begun construction. The projects were expected to create \u201chundreds, if not thousands of jobs\u201d according to the department official. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that they are targeting such an effective program just because it has the word \u2018green\u2019 in its name,\u201d the official said.\nThe department communications office did not respond to questions from The Washington Post. The move is likely to spark legal challenges, as the congressionally authorized funds were already awarded by the department, which is now trying to claw them back.\nThe program, created through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is targeted at upgrading subsidized housing units. It is designed to help building owners and residents lower their utility bills by using less energy, as well as help fund improvements such as fire-resistant roofs and new heating systems that will prolong the life of the units.\n\u201cThis program helps to rehabilitate affordable apartments, making sure residents have lower utility costs and can survive extreme weather,\u201d said Lowell Ungar, federal policy director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \u201cYou disrupt that and it means higher bills for those who can least afford them and greater risk from storms and heat waves.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:08:33"}
