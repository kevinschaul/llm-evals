Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump, Modi aim to cut U.S. trade gap with India amid global tariff concerns\nThe United States and India are working toward a deal that aims to cut America\u2019s sizable trade gap with India as New Delhi pledges to buy more U.S. energy, weapons and civil nuclear power, President Donald Trump said Thursday during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Washington.\nThe meeting with Modi \u2014 the fourth foreign leader to visit Trump in the White House since his inauguration \u2014 was one of the earliest measures of how Trump will handle his relationship with New Delhi. The partnership is a pillar of Washington\u2019s strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, but one that is beset with trouble spots on illegal immigration, visas, America\u2019s large trade deficit with India and controversies over India\u2019s attempted assassination of a Sikh activist on American soil.\nDuring the news conference, Trump sought to emphasize the friendship between Washington and New Delhi, even as he announced shortly before it that the United States would implement a \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff policy that would tax foreign goods at the same rate that other nations apply to American products, potentially complicating talks with India.\nTrump said the United States will increase military sales to India by \u201cmany billions of dollars\u201d and would consider providing New Delhi F-35 fighter jets. He reiterated his dismay with India\u2019s tariffs toward the United States, but said the two countries will negotiate a trade deal that will ensure a \u201clevel playing field.\u201d Trump said India will reform its laws to welcome U.S. nuclear technology into its domestic market.\nOn the issue of immigration \u2014 which sparked outrage in India after the Trump administration sent deportees back to the country in shackles on military fights \u2014 Modi said New Delhi will comply with Trump\u2019s desires. \u201cWe are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they have absolutely no right to be in that country,\u201d Modi said.\nIn one of the few moments the Indian prime minister spoke English, Modi became the latest leader trying to foster a personal relationship with Trump. The Indian leader borrowed from Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rhetoric to announce his own vision: Make India Great Again, or MIGA, he said in English, adding that the two countries could continue to help each other.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes \u2018mega\u2019 \u2014 a mega-partnership for prosperity,\u201d the Indian prime minister said, according to a translator.\nThe United States is India\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-india/\">largest</a> trading partner, buying more than 18 percent of all its exports. India exported $45 billion more to the United States than it imported, and Trump is keen to shrink that deficit. The lack of parity, as well as lingering frustration from a trade deal that never materialized during his first term, drove Trump to describe India on the campaign trail last year as a \u201cvery big abuser\u201d of tariffs.\nIn a call with Modi <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/readout-of-president-donald-j-trumps-call-with-prime-minister-modi-of-india/\">last month</a> \u2014 the second such conversation between the two leaders since the American election \u2014 Trump stressed the \u201cimportance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship,\u201d according to a White House readout.\nModi visited Washington <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/indias-modi-meet-trump-with-planned-tariff-concessions-2025-02-10/\">armed</a> with concessions aimed at averting a trade war and staving off damaging tariffs on the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. The concessions include a commitment to significantly boost purchases of American energy. New Delhi has already reduced tariffs on high-end American motorcycles \u2014 a fixation for Trump, who repeatedly called the 100 percent duty on Harley-Davidsons \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nIndia signaled it was open to offering tariff concessions for imports from the United States in several sectors, including electronics, medical equipment and chemicals, an analyst familiar with the matter said. The Modi administration is looking at potential deals on U.S. agriculture exports and nuclear energy investments, the analyst added, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Reuters earlier reported the possible concessions.\nAhead of his meeting with Trump, Modi on Thursday met with the president\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz. He also held meetings with billionaire Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, according to Indian officials. On Wednesday, he held talks with Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard.\nDuring the news conference Thursday evening, the two leaders said a key path to shrinking America\u2019s trade gap with India involves selling billions of dollars worth of energy, especially liquid natural gas, to India. The Biden administration had paused liquid natural gas project approvals as part of its effort to curb climate change. While the leaders were speaking, Waltz posted on X: \u201cDrill Baby Drill = Buy Baby Buy.\u201d\nModi said that India and the United States will collaborate on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum technology. Trump said the United States would also extradite one of the plotters of the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai.\nAlso, Modi announced that India was moving to change its liability laws to enable U.S. civil nuclear energy firms to sell reactors there. The law currently puts liability on the supplier, not the operator.\nSuch a move would be \u201ca long-sought win for the Trump administration,\u201d said Lindsey Ford, White House director for South Asia in the Biden administration. \u201cBut Modi\u2019s decision to announce a similar agreement with France one day prior is a reminder for the United States that U.S. technology will not be the only game in town.\u201d\nA sign of the growing confidence between the two governments was Trump\u2019s statement that his administration was open to considering selling the vaunted F-35 stealth fighter jet to India, a weapons platform the United States makes available to only its closest and most trusted allies and partners.\nBut the weapon is costly and India would need to \u201cdramatically overhaul and upgrade its industrial security procedures to better protect against espionage and technology leakage,\u201d said Sameer Lalwani, a senior expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gesture of trust\u201d that Trump was even willing to contemplate that, he said. But the Indians are intent on building their own fighter jets, he said.\nThere would also be significant national security concerns with selling the fifth-generation fighter to India, which has recently fielded Russian S-400 air defense systems. Operating the two near one another enhances the risk that the Russian air defenses could acquire data that compromises the fighter\u2019s stealth signature, and could be used by Russia or China to better detect and target American F-35s, he said.\nThe trip also came in the wake of tensions around immigration. Last week, scenes of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/modi-trump-white-house-india-immigration-tariffs/\">dramatic deportation of more than 100 Indians</a>, who were sent back in shackles on a military jet, caused enormous embarrassment to Modi domestically. India is a major source of illegal immigration to the United States. As of 2022, it accounted for 725,000 out of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, according to the Pew Research Center.\nOver the Christmas holiday, far-right activists in Trump\u2019s base engaged in a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/27/h-1b-visas-elon-musk-trump-immigration/\">civil war</a>\u201d with Musk and other senior Trump allies over the need for a skilled-worker visa program that Silicon Valley has long relied on. Many Indians decried the backlash as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/07/india-maga-h1b-visa-america/\">racist</a>.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nModi said he did not discuss with Trump whether the American president would take action on the U.S. court case against Gautam Adani, an Indian billionaire and ally of the Indian prime minister accused of bribery schemes.\nTrump and Modi have forged a positive relationship since their first meeting in 2017, punctuated by reciprocal mass rallies \u2014 \u201cHowdy Modi\u201d in Houston in 2019 and \u201cNamaste Trump\u201d in Ahmedabad, India, in 2020. Their bond stems from a shared strategic interest in countering China as well as the cultivation of a strongman image.\nWashington has over the past 20 years grown closer to New Delhi, slowly diminishing India\u2019s decades-long dependence on Russian arms, for instance, though it has been buying large quantities of Russian oil.\nHeightened tensions with China after deadly border clashes in 2020 helped drive India closer to the United States, which has provided intelligence and equipment, including leased Predator drones, to help India defend its frontier.\nTrump in his first term revived a grouping known as \u201cthe Quad,\u201d consisting of India, Japan, the United States and Australia, widely seen as a counterweight to China\u2019s growing influence in the region. The Biden administration advanced the initiative, and analysts say that Trump may push the group in a more security-oriented direction.\nThe two countries established <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/01/31/india-us-tech-defense/\">a significant partnership</a> in emerging technology during the Biden administration, announcing for instance co-production plans for military jet engines and armored infantry vehicles.\nOne area that is likely to have a lower profile now is human rights, analysts said. The attempted assassination of the Sikh activist in 2023 caused tension between the two governments and led to murder-for-hire charges against an Indian intelligence official, who has since left the government.\nAdministration officials declined to comment on the matter on Thursday.\n\u201cI think now that issue is somewhat behind us,\u201d said Lisa Curtis, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a White House South Asia aide in Trump\u2019s first term.\nTrump also sought to flatter his Indian counterpart, grinning as he responded to a question about who won their negotiations.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a much tougher negotiator than me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a much better negotiator than me.\u201d\n<i>Anant Gupta and Karishma Mehrotra in New Delhi contributed to this report.</i>"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:05:59"}
