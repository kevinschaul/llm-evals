DOGE\u2019s flurry of moves in the first month of the new presidential administration have sparked dozens of lawsuits across the country.\nIn a written opinion Friday, U.S. District Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr. said the nonprofit and the federal worker seeking a preliminary injunction had \u201cnot provided concrete evidence that Defendants are actively misusing or even attempting to misuse their sensitive data.\u201d\nA federal court in Manhattan already had imposed a temporary ban on DOGE access to Americans\u2019 private data held by the Treasury, and other requests for temporary bans are pending before a federal judge in D.C. Alston was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term.\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 fears of future harm are much too speculative and would require the Court to make several leaps in reasoning in order to warrant injunctive relief,\u201d Alston wrote.\nJohn L. Davisson, director of litigation for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said at a hearing Friday that exposing millions of Americans\u2019 private financial data in a \u201chistorically large and consequential breach\u201d violated several federal laws and the Fifth Amendment, and could leave the United States more vulnerable to malign actors.\nIn one of his first executive orders last month, Trump charged DOGE and its de facto leader, billionaire Elon Musk, with modernizing government agencies and reviewing their functions. Justice Department attorneys said in a legal filing that the groups suing over DOGE\u2019s moves were \u201cseeking unprecedented judicial micromanagement of the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to share government data with its own employees.\u201d\nJonathan Lucier, an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, said at a court hearing Friday that the employees in question were all hired by Treasury and OPM or detailed to those agencies. Granting data access to in-house employees carrying out a presidential initiative \u201ccannot be illegal,\u201d Lucier argued.\nTom Krause, a tech company chief executive who briefly worked for DOGE, is now a senior Treasury adviser and the only liaison to the group. Justice Department attorneys said in court papers that he has never been given \u201cdirect access\u201d to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service payment system, only \u201cover-the-shoulder\u201d access \u201cto review activity others performed in the system or data others accessed from the system.\u201d\nBut Justice Department attorneys acknowledged in a footnote that another employee who began working at DOGE and was then hired by Treasury, Marko Elez, did have access to the closely guarded payment system \u2014 which includes details of highly classified programs \u2014 until he resigned Feb. 6. He was found to have made racist statements on social media. Musk said he would rehire Elez, who now works at the Social Security Administration, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/doge-staffer-behind-racist-posts-reappears-at-social-security?embedded-checkout=true\" target=_blank>according to Bloomberg News</a>.\nIn response to a lawsuit filed by 19 states, another federal court barred Krause from accessing Americans\u2019 personal or financial information pending further legal proceedings. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in Manhattan found that the states would face irreparable harm without the temporary ban \u201cbecause of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.\u201d\nAnother federal judge in Manhattan <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/\" target=_blank>issued a preliminary injunction</a> in that case Friday, prohibiting DOGE from accessing the Treasury data while the states\u2019 lawsuit is pending. U.S. District Judge Jeannette A. Vargas said she could lift the ban if the Trump administration can show it is taking steps to safeguard the public\u2019s most sensitive data.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 10:40:07"}
