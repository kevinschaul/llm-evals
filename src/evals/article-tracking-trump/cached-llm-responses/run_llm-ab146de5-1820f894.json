{"args": ["claude-3.7-sonnet", "\nDoes this describe a specific, new, official action or formal announcement already taken/made by the Trump administration? Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nYou can finally press \u2018reset\u2019 on your Instagram feed. Here\u2019s why you should.\nDoes it ever feel like your social media feed just doesn\u2019t get you? Or that it keeps leading your kids down <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/teens-instagram-feed-mental-health/\" target=_blank>unhealthy rabbit holes</a>?\nYou don\u2019t have to put up with it anymore.\nInstagram has released a <a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/reset-instagram-content-suggestions\" target=\"_blank\">long-promised \u201creset\u201d button</a> to U.S. users that clears the algorithms it uses to recommend you photos and videos. TikTok offers a reset button, too. And with a little bit more effort, you can also force YouTube to start fresh with how it recommends what videos to play next.\n\nIt means you now have the power to say goodbye to endless recycled dance moves, polarizing Trump posts, extreme fitness challenges, dramatic pet voice-overs, fruit-cutting tutorials, face-altering filters or whatever other else has taken over your feed like a zombie.\nRight now, many people are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/23/meta-potus-instagram-facebook-tiktok-users/\" target=\"_blank\">fed up</a> with Instagram and its owner Meta \u2014 for filling our apps with junk, for ending <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/08/meta-fact-checking-facebook-instagram-users/\" target=\"_blank\">fact-checking</a> and for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/10/meta-dei-affirmative-action-zuckerberg/\" target=\"_blank\">behavior</a> of its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Resetting my algorithm made my Instagram less annoying without taking the ultimate step of deleting my account. A fresh start is also what the doctor ordered for me and my family\u2019s mental health.\nI know some people love what their apps show them. But the reality is, none of us are really in charge of our social media experience anymore. Instead of just friends, family and the people you choose to follow, nowadays your feed or For You Page is filled with recommended content you never asked for, selected by artificial-intelligence algorithms.\nTheir goal is to keep you hooked, often by showing you things you find outrageous or titillating \u2014 not joyful or calming.\nAnd we know from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/03/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-revealed/\" target=_blank>Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen</a> and others that outrage algorithms can take a particular toll on young people. That\u2019s one reason they\u2019re offering a reset now: because they\u2019re under pressure to give teens and families more control. (Parents of teens, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/17/teen-accounts-parental-controls-setup-instagram/\" target=_blank>see here</a> for some more things you can do to protect your kids.)\n\u201cSometimes we make mistakes,\u201d said Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCjja6Hzc7g/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=_blank>video announcing the reset button</a> last year. \u201cSometimes you might end up in a pattern where you just make Instagram unintentionally into something you do not really love.\u201d (Nice of him to blame us for that, rather than Instagram\u2019s software.)\n\nSo how does the algorithm go awry? It tries to get to know you by tracking every little thing you do. It\u2019s not just likes and shares \u2014 they\u2019re even analyzing your \u201cdwell time,\u201d when you unconsciously scroll more slowly over certain posts.\nBut it doesn\u2019t actually understand your mind. One friend, who\u2019s the mother of a toddler, noticed her Instagram feed was being taken over with smut about parents\u2019 desperate strategies to find private time to do the hokey pokey. Turns out, this is actually a content niche. (How have your feeds gone awry? <a href=\"mailto:geoffrey.fowler@washpost.com\" target=_blank>Email me</a> your horror stories.)\nFor me, an Instagram account I made to share baby photos of my son turned into a fear machine when he was about a month old. It increasingly began showing images of babies with severe and uncommon health conditions, preying on my new-parent vulnerability to the suffering of children.\nI called for Instagram to let us press reset when I <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/12/instagram-algorithm/\" target=_blank>wrote about my nightmare feed</a> in 2022. Now we finally can.\n\nWhat you need to know about how a social media reset works\nAn algorithm reset isn\u2019t the solution to all of our social media problems, but it\u2019s better than what has come before.\nWhen you do the reset on any of your accounts, the recommended content in places like Instagram\u2019s Feed, Explore tab and Reels or TikTok\u2019s For You Page will no longer be tailored to your past behavior.\nYou\u2019ll still see content from friends and accounts you\u2019ve previously chosen to follow. If part of your problem is that you don\u2019t like who you\u2019re following, Instagram will also give you the chance to unfollow a bunch as part of the reset process.\nJust know that once you press reset, you can\u2019t undo it. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make your Instagram much less interesting at first,\u201d warned Instagram\u2019s Mosseri when he announced the reset button.\n\nCounterpoint: You might also see \u201cless interesting\u201d as a good thing. The more likely you are to stop scrolling and put down your phone, the more likely you are to talk to friends, read a book or take a nap. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7iQbBbMAFE\" target=_blank>Free your mind</a>, and the rest will follow.)\nDoing a reset also won\u2019t stop Instagram, TikTok or YouTube from trying to recommend more content you didn\u2019t ask for. They\u2019re just going to start fresh and tailor your algorithm in new ways.\nAfter I pressed reset on Instagram, most of the targeted problematic content I used to see was gone. Instead, my Explore page was filled with generic Instagram trash. But I could see it trying to adapt pretty quickly, for example, offering up more dog content after I watched more dog videos. Instagram says you can send it signals for what kind of algorithm you would like by actively tapping like and watching certain content to the end. (You can also press reset again every time it starts to get annoying.)\nFor my friend with the racy Instagram feed, she still saw \u201cweirdly sex-oriented\u201d content recommended after pressing reset. It\u2019s possible that\u2019s because Instagram was basing her new algorithm on accounts she has followed that sometimes include that kind of content.\nA cynical point of view is that doing a reset allows the tech companies to become even better at preying on us, because they\u2019ll be able to test different algorithms on you.\nAlso know that a reset won\u2019t actually force Instagram to delete your old data \u2014 only deleting your whole account can do that. Nor will pressing the algorithm reset button do away with all of the data they use to target you with ads.\n\nFor YouTube, a reset involves deleting the history of videos you\u2019ve watched in the past. That\u2019s one of the major signals that YouTube uses to make future recommendations. You can even turn off your YouTube history going forward, so its algorithms won\u2019t have the data to try to interpret your interests.\nIf you\u2019re not ready to totally say goodbye to your algorithm, there may be other things you can do to tailor your experience. Many social media apps let you nip and tuck around the edges of your algorithm by tapping buttons to say you like or want to see more or less of certain topics. TikTok has a slider, in settings, to request more or less dance, fashion, nature or pets. On YouTube, if you click \u201clike\u201d on what you do like, its algorithms should listen. (Some people even turn shaping their algorithms into an art \u2014 there was <a href=\"https://x.com/old_ric/status/1875955842509635944\" target=_blank>one guy</a> who crafted an Instagram that recommends nothing but eggs.)\nIf, like me, what you really want is social media that features only the stuff you followed, you can kind of hack your way into it. There\u2019s another Instagram setting under \u201cContent preferences\u201d called \u201csnooze suggested posts in feed\u201d that tells the app to stop recommending content there for 30 days. You just have to keep going back to press it again every month. This, sadly, is what counts as putting users \u201cin control\u201d these days.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:10:35"}
