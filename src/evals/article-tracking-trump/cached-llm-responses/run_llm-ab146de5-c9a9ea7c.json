Roberts Jr. granted the Trump administration\u2019s request late Wednesday to pause a lower court\u2019s midnight deadline for the government to resume nearly $2 billion in foreign aid payments suspended for weeks.\nThe brief administrative order, which did not address the underlying legal issues, will allow time for a full Supreme Court review.\nU.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali had given the administration until 11:59 p.m. to fulfill its contractual obligations and restart the payments to organizations whose work in impoverished parts of the world had been stopped since President Donald Trump halted such foreign assistance in late January.\nActing solicitor general Sarah M. Harris, the government\u2019s top appellate lawyer, had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25546029-24a831/\" target=_blank>asked the Supreme Court to block Ali\u2019s order</a>, which she said had \u201cthrown what should be an orderly review by the government into chaos.\u201d\nThe lower-court order, Harris wrote, exceeds the judiciary\u2019s authority. The government is \u201ccommitted to paying legitimate claims for work that was properly completed,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat the government cannot do is pay arbitrarily determined demands on an arbitrary timeline of the district court\u2019s choosing.\u201d\nRoberts gave the global aid organizations challenging the administration\u2019s actions until noon Friday to respond to those assertions.\nThe request to the Supreme Court marked the second time the new administration has asked the justices to intervene after a lower-court judge blocked Trump\u2019s efforts to reshape the federal government. Last week, the high court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/21/trump-dellinger-fire-supreme-court/\" target=_blank>refused to immediately clear the way</a> for the removal of Hampton Dellinger, the head of an independent watchdog agency, whom Trump tried to fire.\nTrump issued the wide-ranging pause on foreign aid shortly after his inauguration. His allies quickly began dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, the $40 billion arm of the government that assists humanitarian work in more than 100 countries. The moves <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">left millions of people at risk of hunger and illness</a> and thousands of USAID employees without jobs, some stranded in dangerous places around the world.\nTwo groups \u2014 the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council \u2014 filed suit. On Feb. 13, Ali, a Biden appointee who has been on the bench only since December, issued a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/14/usaid-trump-farmers-food-for-peace-kansas/\" target=_blank>temporary restraining order</a> prohibiting the administration from stopping the aid payments.\nBut in the days that followed, advocates alleged in court, administration officials openly defied the order, continued to lay off thousands of staffers and contractors, and started terminating thousands of grants that did not fit the administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio had earlier exempted some of the relief programs from the pause for work deemed \u201clifesaving.\u201d But a key payment system has remained largely offline, which has left aid partners without enough cash to continue their work and stranded thousands of pounds of food and medicine far from the communities desperate for help.\nOn Tuesday, Ali gave officials his deadline for restarting payments. The Trump administration immediately appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, saying that disbursing nearly $2 billion payments would take weeks.\nThree hours before Ali\u2019s deadline, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit<a href=\"https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/orders/docs/2025/02/25-5046LDSD.pdf\" target=_blank> turned away</a> the administration\u2019s request, saying it does not have the right to appeal at this early stage of the litigation before the U.S. district judge has finished his work.\nAt that point, the solicitor general\u2019s office had already asked the Supreme Court to intervene.\nHarris told the justices that the government cannot function and the president cannot carry out his duties over foreign affairs if \u201ca district court can appoint itself the claims-processor for the federal government and second-guess the Executive Branch\u2019s determinations.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the plaintiffs alleged that a small number of Trump\u2019s political appointees, acting at the direction of Trump adviser Elon Musk, were refusing to authorize or vetoing the back payments to foreign aid.\nA Trump administration official said via email Wednesday evening that the State Department and USAID had just completed a review of its programming, identifying nearly $4.4 billion in grants for elimination. Nearly 5,800 awards were targeted for elimination as part of \u201cthe America First agenda,\u201d the official said.\nUSAID retained critical awards, including food assistance, lifesaving medical treatments for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, and support for nations like Lebanon, Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba, the official said.\nThe review had been ongoing when Ali \u201cintervened\u201d in the process, the official added, and the State Department and USAID moved \u201crapidly to complete the programmatic evaluation,\u201d lifting stop-work orders for some programs and terminating others.\nAid groups and contractors told The Washington Post on Wednesday that they were receiving government notices of thousands of aid projects being terminated, despite the federal judge\u2019s ruling that foreign assistance should continue.\n<i>John Hudson contributed to this report.</i>\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:17:01"}
