{"args": ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "Is this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nDHS to end temporary protection for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem has decided to end temporary humanitarian protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans who sought refuge in the United States in the past few years, putting them at imminent risk of being forced to return to the autocratic regime they left behind in South America.\nNoem wrote that conditions in Venezuela \u201cno longer\u201d met the criteria for its citizens to qualify for temporary protected status, which was set to expire in April for those who became eligible for it in 2023, according to a copy of the <a href=\"https://washingtonpost.com/documents/cfb3c9b8-fff3-49eb-98dd-d2a3fcd9b891.pdf\" target=_blank>unpublished notice</a> that DHS released Sunday.\nThe Biden administration had extended their protections through the fall of 2026, citing extreme poverty and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/10/el-salvador-temporary-protected-status/\" target=_blank>economic and political crises</a>. But the Trump administration quickly reversed that decision, and now the group that received temporary protection in 2023 could lose it 60 days after the notice is officially published in the Federal Register. Officials did not say when it could publish.\nNoem also determined that allowing Venezuelans to live and work in the United States is \u201ccontrary to the national interest,\u201d she said, citing gang activity \u2014 though criminals are generally ineligible for temporary protection \u2014 as well as the cost to cities such as New York to shelter migrants and other concerns.\nNoem acknowledged that Venezuela is still struggling with many of the issues that the Biden administration raised, but she said there were \u201cnotable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime.\u201d\n\u201cIn particular, the Secretary has determined it is contrary to the national interest to permit the covered Venezuelan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States,\u201d the notice said. The New York Times first reported on the protection revocations.\nEnding protections for Venezuelans is a marked shift for the Trump administration, which granted them reprieves from deportation during his first term, and Noem\u2019s decision is expected to face legal challenges. Her announcement comes a day after President Donald Trump said <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/01/trump-venezuela-deportation-maduro-migrants/\" target=_blank>the government</a> of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro would accept the return of Venezuelans.\nTrump has vowed to carry out mass deportations and his administration launched with a blitz of immigration arrests nationwide. Trump officials emphasize that criminals are their top priority for removal but say that anyone in the United States illegally could be deported.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who is on a tour of Latin America, lobbied intensively for the temporary protections as a U.S. senator, writing in 2022 that it would be a \u201cvery real death sentence\u201d to force Venezuelans to return home.\nRubio referred questions to DHS last week after Noem reversed the Biden administration\u2019s extension of protections for Venezuelans.\nIn one of the last acts of his first term, Trump granted <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferred-enforced-departure-certain-venezuelans/\" target=_blank>Venezuelans</a> permission to stay in the United States because of the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d conditions in their homeland.\nPolitical support for Venezuelans waned, however, after the slaying last year of a Georgia nursing student by a man from Venezuela with a criminal history, including shoplifting.\nA House investigation into the man\u2019s immigration status found that he had crossed the border illegally and sought <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/08-16-2024-The-Case-of-the-Illegal-Alien-Who-Murdered-Laken-Riley.pdf\" target=_blank>asylum</a>, but it did not find that he had temporary protected status.<b> </b>Trump repeatedly referred to the murder on the campaign trail and he recently signed into law the Laken Riley Act, expanding mandatory detention for immigrants arrested for theft-related crimes.\nHuman rights organizations, immigration lawyers and politicians condemned Noem\u2019s decision Sunday, given the continuing emergencies in Venezuela, including shortages of food, water and electricity, and political crackdowns against Maduro opponents.\n\u201cThere is bipartisan agreement that TPS recipients from Venezuela shouldn\u2019t be forced to return to extremely dangerous conditions,\u201d Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada) said in a statement Sunday. \u201cNothing about Venezuela\u2019s communist regime has changed since 2023, and taking away these protections for hardworking families doesn\u2019t make our country any safer.\u201d\n\nWilfredo Allen, a South Florida immigration attorney, said Noem\u2019s decision was \u201cshocking\u201d given that Trump withdrew diplomatic personnel from Venezuela in 2019 and has maintained sanctions against the country.\nAhilan Arulanantham, a UCLA law professor who led the lawsuit that blocked Trump from terminating protections for Haitians and other groups during his first term, said Noem\u2019s actions are \u201cplainly illegal.\u201d\nVenezuelans are the largest group by far in the United States with temporary protected status, a humanitarian program created under a 1990 law for people from countries destabilized by war, a natural disaster or another emergency.\nSoon before he left office, President Joe Biden\u2019s Department of Homeland Security secretary, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/02/05/alejandro-mayorkas-impeachment-and-border-legacy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4\" target=_blank>Alejandro Mayorkas</a>, extended protections for up to 600,000 Venezuelans through <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/10/el-salvador-temporary-protected-status/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4\" target=_blank>October 2026</a>.\nHe had granted them temporary protected status in 2021 and 2023. The 2023 group\u2019s protections were set to expire April 2, while the 2021 group\u2019s status will expire Sept. 10.\nCritics of the TPS program have long argued that repeat extensions flout the temporary intent of the law. Most of those who apply don\u2019t otherwise qualify for legal status, and on his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order saying that the program should be \u201climited in scope.\u201d\nImmigrants from 17 countries have the protection, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the program. Before he left office, Mayorkas expanded protections for about 85 percent of those enrolled in the program, including<b> </b>El Salvador, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/01/10/dhs-extend-temporary-protected-status-ukraine\" target=_blank>Ukraine</a> and Sudan.\nProtections for other countries, such as Honduras, are set to expire in the coming months.\n\nIn her analysis, Noem said TPS allowed a \u201csignificant population\u201d of Venezuelans with no clear path to<b> </b>a<b> </b>lawful immigration status into the United States, and said extending temporary protections could encourage more to arrive.\nAbby Maxman, president and chief executive of Oxfam America, said TPS recipients are already integrated into communities across the United States, and needed to work in health care, construction and farming.\n\u201cRevoking TPS is not only inhumane but also economically disastrous,\u201d she said in a statement, calling the move \u201ca direct attack on families and communities who have sought safety and stability in the United States.\u201d\n<i>Mariana Alfaro contributed to this report.</i>"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:07:28"}
