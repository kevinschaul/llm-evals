Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump says new tariffs on computer chips are coming\nPresident Donald Trump said he would soon announce new tariffs on computer chips, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/07/raimondo-trump-chips-reckless/\" target=_blank>repeating a campaign promise</a> that if enacted could have deep impacts on the global tech industry and the geopolitical battle over AI with China.\nTrump criticized the Biden administration\u2019s policy of using taxpayer money to subsidize the construction of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing facilities and said that a tariff on importing computer chips would work better at forcing companies to move their factories to the United States.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to want to pay a 25, 50 or even 100 percent tax,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you want to stop paying the taxes or the tariffs, you have to build your plant right here in America.\u201d\nThough the United States is the global leader in designing chips, the vast majority of chip production happens overseas, particularly in Taiwan, where the high-end computer chips necessary for training and running AI models are made.\n<b>\u201c</b>They left us and they went to Taiwan,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want them to come back and we don\u2019t want to give them billions of dollars.\u201d\nTrump also said the technical breakthroughs made by Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek should spur U.S. companies to compete harder to maintain the United States\u2019 lead in artificial intelligence technology.\nDeepSeek\u2019s AI tech has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/27/deep-seek-ai-markets-nvidia/\" target=_blank>sent shock waves through Silicon Valley and Wall Street</a>, after the company claimed that its AI chatbot that rivals the capability of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT cost just $6 million to train, a fraction of what top U.S. AI companies use to develop their programs.\n\u201cThe release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win because we have the greatest scientists in the world,\u201d Trump said.\nDeepSeek\u2019s apparent breakthrough in making much more efficient AI could be a positive because the tech is now also available to U.S. companies, he said."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:28:47"}
