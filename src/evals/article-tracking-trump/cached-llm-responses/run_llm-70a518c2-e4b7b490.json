Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nNFL competition committee begins mulling possible tweaks to kickoff format\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The NFL will consider modifying its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/03/27/nfl-new-kickoff-breakdown/\" target=_blank>year-old kickoff format</a> this offseason by moving the spot of the ball <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/10/01/nfl-kickoff-format-change/\" target=_blank>on a touchback</a> or by moving the spot of the kick itself, the co-chairman of the league\u2019s competition committee said Sunday.\nThe comments by Rich McKay, also the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons, came after the committee held its first meeting of the week at the NFL scouting combine as part of the league\u2019s offseason rule-change process.\n\u201cIf something is going to be proposed as far as modifications \u2026 which would be the potential of moving the touchback and/or moving the kicker back, I think those will get talked about, you know, within the next 30 days,\u201d McKay said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll take a little while before we get everybody\u2019s input.\u201d\nThe kickoff format must be reapproved this offseason by the NFL\u2019s team owners, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/03/26/nfl-kickoff-change/\" target=_blank>ratified it last offseason</a> on a one-year basis. That is expected to happen. The alignment fulfilled its dual mandate by raising the percentage of kickoffs being returned while bringing the injury rate on the play more in line with that of a running or passing play.\nBut the owners also could have proposed tweaks to consider when they gather late next month at the annual league meeting in Palm Beach, Florida. Those changes would be designed to promote even more returns. The spot of the touchback on a kickoff could be moved from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line to further discourage kicks into the end zone. Or the kick itself could be moved five yards back, making it more challenging for kickers to reach the opposite end zone. It\u2019s also possible both changes could be enacted.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have people that\u2019ll say both,\u201d McKay said Sunday. \u201cYou\u2019ll have people say one or the other. It\u2019s always easier to start with one or the other than it is both. And you want to have all of the health and safety implications or potential implications from either change. But I think it\u2019ll be one or the other, I would think. You never know. I know there\u2019s people already talking about, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s talk about both.\u2019 But I also know there\u2019s this thing called 24 votes.\u201d\nAny proposed rule changes must be ratified by at least 24 of the 32 teams.\nThe competition committee met Sunday with a group of special teams coaches who contributed last offseason to crafting the format, in which the kicker lines up alone on one half of the field while his teammates line up on the opposite side of the field, only a few yards from players on the receiving team. The group is scheduled to meet Monday with NFL health and safety officials.\n\u201cThe easier of the options to make sure that you\u2019re going to move the number up on return percentage, in my mind, is the touchback,\u201d McKay said. \u201cOur kickers now in the game are really good. So moving the kick back, I don\u2019t know how much you impact that.\u201d\nThe competition committee also spoke to the special teams coaches Sunday about the onside kick. League leaders have called the onside kick <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/18/nfl-onside-kick/\" target=_blank>a \u201cdead\u201d and \u201cceremonial\u201d play</a> because of its low success rate. Under the current kickoff format, a team must declare its intention to attempt an onside kick only while trailing in the fourth quarter. At that point, the alignment reverts to the traditional kickoff setup so the team can try an onside kick.\nThe special teams coaches believe the onside kick success rate could be improved with adjustments to the rules dictating how the teams must align themselves to begin the play, McKay said. But alternatively, McKay said he could foresee renewed consideration being given this offseason to a fourth-and-15 or fourth-and-20 alternative to the onside kick. That measure, which would enable a team to retain possession of the ball by converting such a fourth-down offensive play, has been proposed by individual NFL teams in the past without ever coming particularly close to being approved by the owners.\n\u201cI still believe it could\u201d be considered again this offseason, McKay said. \u201cI could see it because [teams have] brought it up before. That said, you have to get 24 votes. So you have to have other alternatives, one of which may be, \u2018Okay, should we tweak the way that they line up and see if we can get the percentage to move?\u2019\u201d\nThe committee spent two hours Sunday on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/01/22/nfl-officiating-patrick-mahomes-roughing/\" target=\"_blank\">potential further expansion</a> of the list of plays that could be subject <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/02/nfl-electronic-first-downs-replay-assist/\" target=\"_blank\">to the replay assist system</a>, McKay said, and will spend more time on that topic Monday. It is scheduled to receive a presentation Monday regarding the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/01/nfl-first-down-electronic-measurement-system/\" target=\"_blank\">possible use next season</a> of an electronic system <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/02/29/nfl-high-tech-first-downs/\" target=\"_blank\">to measure first downs</a>. That system still would require the on-field officials to spot the ball manually following a play before the electronic system would be used to determine whether a first down was achieved.\nThe push-the-quarterback sneak <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/08/tush-push-eagles-super-bowl/\" target=_blank>popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles</a> was not discussed Sunday by the committee, McKay said, but he added: \u201cI think it will be.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:53:41"}
