Yarl had rung his doorbell to pick up his 11-year-old twin brothers, who were actually at a residence a block away, at a similar-sounding address. He had never met the family of his brothers\u2019 friends, nor had he been to their home.\nYarl <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/06/27/ralph-yarl-shooting-interview-gma/\" target=\"_blank\">later recalled</a> his confusion and disbelief when he was waiting at Lester\u2019s door and saw a man appear with a weapon.\n\u201cI hear the door open, I see this old man, and I\u2019m assuming \u2018Oh, this must be like their Grandpa,\u2019\u201d Yarl <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XscOmEBDFlw\" target=_blank>told ABC News</a> in June 2023. \u201cAnd then he pulls out this gun.\u201d\nYarl said he turned away from Lester, afraid but in disbelief that he would shoot. After he was shot, he fell to the ground and landed on shattered glass from the door before he ran away, screaming for help in the neighborhood. He later collapsed in another residence\u2019s driveway.\n\u201cHe only said five words: \u2018Don\u2019t come here ever again,\u2019\u201d Yarl recounted Lester saying. Lester <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/19/ralph-yarl-andrew-lester-shooting-black-fear/\" target=\"_blank\">told police</a> that the two did not exchange any words before the attack.\nThe shooting <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/09/01/ralph-yarl-shooting-andrew-lester-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">became another flash point</a> in conversations about racism and violence in the United States, with activists and rights groups again taking issue with \u201cstand your ground\u201d gun laws and their potential justification for the shooting of innocent Black men who are wrongly perceived as dangerous.\nA Missouri self-defense law <a href=\"https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=563.031\" target=\"_blank\">states</a> that a person can shoot if the individual \u201creasonably believes that such deadly force is necessary\u201d to protect \u201cagainst death, serious physical injury, or any forcible felony.\u201d Lester <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/06/27/ralph-yarl-shooting-interview-gma/\" target=\"_blank\">had told police</a> that he was \u201cscared to death\u201d of Yarl.\nShortly after the incident, the Clay County prosecutor\u2019s office <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/06/27/ralph-yarl-shooting-interview-gma/\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> that there was \u201ca racial component\u201d to the shooting. Several state lawmakers, clergy members and civil rights leaders also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/18/andrew-lester-ralph-yarl-shooting/\" target=\"_blank\">criticized</a> the Kansas City Police Department for taking several days to arrest Lester, who turned himself in less than 24 hours after prosecutors issued an arrest warrant.\nThe shooting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOf8MCekqY8\" target=_blank>sparked protests</a> in Kansas City, and then-President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://x.com/POTUS/status/1648390965797744640?s=20\" target=_blank>called Yarl</a>. In April 2023, Biden invited him to visit the White House.\n\u201cNo parent should have to worry that their kid will be shot after ringing the wrong doorbell,\u201d Biden had said on social media. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep up the fight against gun violence.\u201d\nLester\u2019s cause of death was not released. He was scheduled to be sentenced March 7, according to Wednesday\u2019s statement from Zachary Thompson, prosecuting attorney of Clay County.\nIn a statement posted to Instagram, Yarl\u2019s family <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGRbbDCp2nf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=_blank>said</a> that Lester\u2019s death \u201cdoes not bring justice.\u201d\n\u201cFor nearly two years, Andrew Lester never apologized. Instead, he and his attorney used every legal maneuver possible to delay accountability,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cNow, another Black child harmed by prejudice will never see the man who shot him face the full weight of the justice system.\u201d"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:07:09"}
