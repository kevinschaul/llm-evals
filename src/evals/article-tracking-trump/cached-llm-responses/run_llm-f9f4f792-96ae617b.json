{"args": ["gemini-2.0-flash", "Is this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump orders sweeping review of federal regulations\nPresident Donald Trump ordered federal agencies Wednesday to review all of their regulations and cease enforcing those that do not conform to his political views, intensifying a sweeping deregulatory campaign that could eliminate many of the government\u2019s rules on climate, education, health and labor protections.\nThe <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-lawful-governance-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-regulatory-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\">new directive</a> tasked each federal agency to work with the U.S. DOGE Service \u2014 the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/14/doge-employees-list-staff-elon-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">team of mostly young aides</a> assembled by tech billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 to identify all regulations that either carry high costs or do not seem in the White House\u2019s eyes to be explicitly authorized by existing law.\nFederal officials then must report back to the White House, its budget office and the Justice Department, in a process meant to inform efforts to \u201crescind or modify\u201d the rules. Trump also set the stage for agencies to terminate any enforcement proceedings that seem to run counter to the administration\u2019s beliefs on federal regulation or policy.\nThe White House mandate in some ways formalized a process that occurs at the start of every administration, as new leaders take office and look to shape the federal government to their liking. But Trump, in particular, has already exhibited great willingness to push the limits of presidential power to achieve his agenda \u2014 eliminating entire agencies, programs and funding streams, even those explicitly authorized by Congress, despite the objections of Democrats on Capitol Hill.\nSome of the ideas resemble Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for his presidency prepared by the Heritage Foundation ahead of the 2024 elections. Its contributors include Russell Vought, who is set to play a critical role overseeing federal agencies as White House budget director."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 10:55:59"}
