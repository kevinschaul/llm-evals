Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\n\u2018You are not alone\u2019: U.S. Forest Service chief\u2019s blunt goodbye message to workers\nThe head of the U.S. Forest Service announced his retirement in a blunt, emotional email to staff Wednesday, after thousands of employees <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/17/trump-fires-federal-workers-performance/\" target=_blank>were let go</a> from a department that oversees nearly 200 million acres of American woods and grasslands.\n\u201cThe past several weeks has been incredibly difficult,\u201d Forest Service Chief Randy Moore wrote in the email, which was also <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/leadership/note-reflection\" target=_blank>posted</a> on the agency\u2019s website. Thousands of Forest Service employees have been fired amid President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to downsize the federal government, led by billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/25/doge-administrator/\" target=_blank>U.S. DOGE Service.</a>\n\u201cIf you are feeling uncertainty, frustration, or loss, you are not alone,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cThese are real and valid emotions that I am feeling, too. Please take care of yourselves and each other. I have been silent these last few weeks because these decisions are being made at a level above our organization, and I was and am learning about the changes the same time as many of you.\u201d\nThe Agriculture Department, which oversees the Forest Service, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Feb. 14, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/14/secretary-rollins-takes-bold-action-stop-wasteful-spending-and-optimize-usda-better-serve-american\">said</a> in a statement that she welcomed the efforts of DOGE \u201cbecause we know that its work makes us better, stronger, faster, and more efficient.\u201d\nMoore, the first Black chief of the Forest Service, said in his email that he had worked for the organization for 45 years. He has <a href=\"https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/people/chiefs/randy-moore/\">held</a> its top post since 2021. His retirement was met with mixed emotions from current employees.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been the soul of the Forest Service,\u201d said one staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. \u201cThe agency is diminished with his departure.\u201d\nBut one employee said Moore did not push hard enough for better pay at the agency.\n\u201cA lot of Forest Service folks are not sad to see him go,\u201d the employee said. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s the devil you know versus the unknown.\u201d\nSome politicians and activists have raised alarms over the culling of an agency responsible for mitigating and fighting <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/11/29/eastern-wildfires-firefighters-risk-west-coast/\" target=_blank>wildfires</a>.\n\u201cThe decision to fire thousands of FS employees will undoubtedly impact the agency\u2019s ability to fight wildfires,\u201d Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) wrote in a Feb. 14 letter to Rollins. \u201cWhile reports suggest that public safety employees were not part of the mass firing, positions that support forest management were included.\u201d\nIn his departure note, Moore acknowledged there may  be more challenges ahead.\n\u201cThe workforce will continue to be unsettled for a while,\u201d Moore wrote. He added, \u201cAs I end my career and reflect on it, I am validated in knowing and believing that the Forest Service is about its people and its worthy mission.\u201d\n<i>Hannah Natanson and Maxine Joselow contributed to this report.</i>\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:49:33"}
