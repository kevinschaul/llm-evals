Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nSenators ask nominees about Trump\u2019s potential defiance of court orders\nA Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday for three top Justice Department lawyers was dominated by concerns from lawmakers who asked when, if ever, a president could defy a court order.\nDemocrats and Republican Sen. John Neely Kennedy (Louisiana) made clear they think the answer should be never.\nBut Aaron Reitz, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the department\u2019s Office of Legal Policy, was equivocal on the matter.<b> </b>D. John Sauer, the president\u2019s pick to serve as the government\u2019s top advocate at the Supreme Court, was more definitive.\nThe question was urgent, Democratic lawmakers said, as judges throughout the country have forcefully pushed back on Trump\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal workforce, halt government spending and dismantle federal agencies. Some Trump administration officials, <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1888607143030391287\">including Vice President JD Vance</a>, have publicly questioned the authority of judges in response to recent rulings against some of the president\u2019s executive orders.\nThe administration on Wednesday was appealing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/usaid-aid-supreme-court-payment-deadline/\" target=\"_blank\">a looming court deadline</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/25/usaid-funding-trump-administration-court/\"> </a>to pay hundreds of millions in foreign assistance funds that have remained in limbo despite a judge\u2019s previous order.\n\n\u201cThere is no hard and fast rule in all instances in which a litigant must comply with all or some or various parts of a judicial decision,\u201d Reitz, who is currently chief of staff to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), told lawmakers at the hearing. \u201cIt is so fact-, law- and case-specific that one cannot speak generally.\u201d\nSauer, who has represented Trump in his previous criminal cases, said, \u201cGenerally, if there\u2019s a direct court order that binds a federal or state official, they should follow it.\u201d\nAs to whether Trump would defy a direct order, he said that having represented Trump for nearly two years, \u201cI just think that\u2019s not a plausible scenario.\u201d\nIn response to those answers, Kennedy offered a forceful directive to the president\u2019s nominees:\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever, ever take the position that you\u2019re not going to follow the order of a federal court \u2014 ever. Now, you can disagree with it within the bounds of legal ethics. You can criticize it. You can appeal it or you can resign,\u201d he said. He separately noted his frustration with what he called efforts to undermine the legitimacy of the judiciary during the Biden administration.\nThe committee also heard Wednesday from Harmeet K. Dhillon, a California lawyer and Republican National Committee member who is nominated to lead the department\u2019s civil rights division. She, too, worked as one of Trump\u2019s private attorneys.\nSauer, who is nominated<b> </b>to serve as<b> </b>solicitor general,<b> </b>has already scored one landmark victory for Trump<b> </b>before the Supreme Court,<b> </b>winning a broad expansion of presidential immunity in Trump\u2019s election interference case.\nSen. Peter Welch (D-Vermont) invoked that court decision Wednesday when he raised concerns about the power of Congress to restrain the president\u2019s authority, citing what he<b> </b>called \u201ca profoundly new set of expectations and boundaries about what the executive power is now.\u201d\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Sauer would play a critical role shaping the administration\u2019s legal strategy as it responds to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/trump-lawsuits-executive-orders-actions-legal-challenges/\">flood of litigation</a> over Trump\u2019s aggressive moves.\nSauer, a Rhodes scholar and graduate of Harvard Law School, was a law clerk to conservative justice Antonin Scalia and another leading conservative, J. Michael Luttig, a former appeals court judge. He spent<b> </b>five years as a federal prosecutor before becoming the solicitor general of Missouri when the state attorney general\u2019s office was led by Josh Hawley and then Eric Schmitt \u2014 both of whom are now Republican U.S. senators from the state.\nThey had high praise for Sauer when they introduced him to the committee Wednesday. After he left the state attorney general\u2019s office, he opened<b> </b>a small law practice instead of joining a big firm.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think John wanted to be in a position where he couldn\u2019t do work that interested him because it conflicted with the business of the firm,\u201d said John Demers, who worked alongside Sauer as a co-clerk to Scalia and led the Justice Department\u2019s national security division in the first Trump administration. \u201cHe took cases he believed in, and he wanted to have the freedom to do them.\u201d\nIn addition to defending Trump personally, Sauer joined unsuccessful <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O155/163215/20201209144840609_2020-12-09%20-%20Texas%20v.%20Pennsylvania%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20Missouri%20et%20al.%20-%20Final%20with%20Tables.pdf\">efforts to try to overturn</a> the 2020 presidential election results and has a long track record of advocating for conservative causes. He has defended <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-449/328563/20241017143623902_Petersen%20v.%20Doe%20-%20Petition.pdf\">restrictions on transgender athletes</a> in Arizona and efforts to limit access to abortion in Missouri. Sauer also<b> </b>helped lead litigation accusing the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-411/280017/20230920145521680_2023-09-20%20-%20Murthy%20v.%20Missouri%20-%20Opposition%20to%20Stay%20Application%20-%20FINAL.pdf\">Biden administration of collaborating with social media platforms</a> to censor conservative voices online.\nLast year, Sauer donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Missouri Right to Life\u2019s political action committee as it opposed a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/29/abortion-missouri-ballot-amendment-election/\">ballot measure to protect abortion rights</a> in the state, according to Missouri campaign finance records reviewed by The Washington Post.\nIn court, he often tangled with attorney Chuck Hatfield, who represented Planned Parenthood in Missouri in its efforts to retain funding and renew a license to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/02/missouri-restricts-abortion-planned-parenthood-opens-massive-new-clinic-across-border/\">operate a surgical abortion center</a>. Hatfield called Sauer fast-talking, hardworking and incredibly bright. He also said Sauer is<b> </b>\u201cnot the kind of lawyer who is going to try to dissuade his client from a position that he thinks might be a stretch or inconsistent with current law.\u201d\n\u201cJohn is not likely to be a roadblock to policy positions his clients want to take,\u201d said Hatfield, who earlier spent a decade working in the state attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cHe\u2019s more likely to be an advocate in favor of those positions \u2014 and a very good, a very smart one.\u201d\nIn Scalia\u2019s chambers, Sauer stood out for his wide-ranging knowledge, outstanding memory,<b> </b>and ability to talk about everything from pop culture to theology and philosophy.\n\u201cHe\u2019s never offensive, but he loves to argue,\u201d Demers said of Sauer\u2019s style. \u201cHe argues on the substance; it\u2019s not an argument about who can raise their voice louder.\u201d\nIn the days before<b> </b>Trump\u2019s return to the White House, Sauer continued to represent him at the Supreme Court. He tried unsuccessfully to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/09/trump-sentencing-supreme-court-new/\">delay Trump\u2019s sentencing</a> in New York for his hush money conviction<b> </b>and <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-656/336151/20241227163400981_2024-12-27%20-%20TikTok%20v.%20Garland%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20President%20Donald%20J.%20Trump.pdf\">filed an unusual brief</a> seeking an opportunity for Trump<b> </b>to negotiate a deal to prevent TikTok, the video-sharing app, from going dark.\n\u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government,\u201d Sauer wrote. The brief was<b> </b>criticized by the Wall Street Journal editorial page and others for not staking out a legal position and suggesting that there could be more than one president at a time.\nSauer\u2019s most high-profile role came last year, when he asked the Supreme Court to rule that Trump \u2014 accused in D.C. federal court of trying to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory \u2014 should be broadly protected from prosecution for his official actions while in the White House.\nIn response to a hypothetical question from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Sauer suggested that it could be an official action, and therefore immune, if a president <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2023/23-939_3fb4.pdf\">ordered the military to assassinate a political rival</a>.\nThe high court\u2019s conservative supermajority ruled in favor of Trump, saying that a president\u2019s official actions could not be prosecuted, though his<b> </b>private conduct<b> </b>could be.\nLuttig, who has become an outspoken Trump critic, said his former law clerk is intellectually honest and has great integrity. While Luttig disagreed with the court\u2019s<b> </b>immunity ruling, he said Sauer made the only possible argument that could save Trump from criminal prosecution.\n\u201cA man who can convince the Supreme Court that the Constitution affords the President of the United States absolute immunity can convince the Supreme Court the Constitution means anything he wants,\u201d Luttig said. \u201cThat the Supreme Court bought the fallacious argument hook, line and sinker was not to Mr. Sauer\u2019s discredit. It was to the Supreme Court\u2019s discredit.\u201d\nAll three nominees seemed to have the support they would need from Republicans to advance to the full Senate.\nAs head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, Dhillon would oversee an office whose work<b> </b>traditionally has included<b> </b>investigating police misconduct, enforcing voting rights and filing<b> </b>cases over<b> </b>alleged civil rights<b> </b>violations.\nIf confirmed, she would be the first Sikh American to hold the position.\nDhillon<b> </b>has previously garnered attention for her legal work targeting social media companies, challenging corporate diversity policies, and suing over California\u2019s pandemic restrictions.\nReitz, a Marine Corps veteran who previously worked for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), would oversee a Justice Department office tasked with advising the attorney general on policy and assisting in the selection of nominees for the federal bench.\nDemocrats repeatedly confronted him Wednesday with his past posts on the social media site X, many of which have been deleted. One post from March 2020 responded to a ruling from U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel temporarily blocking Texas from closing an abortion clinic during the covid pandemic.\n\u201cJudge Yeakal has made his decision. Now let him enforce it,\u201d Reitz wrote, echoing an apocryphal quote attributed to Andrew Jackson in response to a much earlier court ruling.\nHe was asked at multiple points during Wednesday\u2019s hearing to commit to the concept that even the president should be bound by adverse court rulings. Reitz repeatedly resisted giving a firm answer.\n\u201cMy position reflects a fairly mainstream view within right-of-center jurisprudential circles, which is simply to suggest that various Supreme Court or Court of Appeals decisions are more limited in scope than maybe our friends who share a different jurisprudential view of Supreme Court holdings would suggest,\u201d he said.\nSen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) pushed back. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving me great confidence by not stating unequivocally that we are a<b> </b>nation that respects the separation of powers, the role of the courts and \u2026 the traditions of the country,\u201d he said.\n<i>Razzan Nakhlawi contributed to this report.</i>\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:54:13"}
