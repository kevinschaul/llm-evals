Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and Ron Wyden (Oregon), the top Democrats on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, respectively, are asking the Government Accountability Office to investigate Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s decision to grant Elon Musk and his \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d acolytes <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/01/elon-musk-treasury-payments-system/\" target=_blank>access to sensitive government payment systems</a>.\nIn a letter to the GAO \u2014 the congressional watchdog \u2014 Warren and Wyden say reports of Musk\u2019s access to the delicate financial systems \u201care deeply troubling.\u201d The systems, they note, process trillions of dollars of transactions each year, contain sensitive personal and financial information about millions of Americans, and ensure that Social Security checks, tax refunds and Medicare benefits are paid on time.\n\u201cGAO must investigate and determine who was granted access to these systems, why and how this access was granted, and the implications for the nation\u2019s economic and national security,\u201d they wrote. The senators specifically point to Bessent, highlighting reports that he was personally involved in granting Musk and his team access to the systems, and that he was also involved in the pushing out of the Treasury Department\u2019s top career official, David Lebryk, who long oversaw the federal government\u2019s financial infrastructure and operations.\n\u201cThe access may threaten economic and national security,\u201d the senators wrote.\nWarren and Wyden directed the GAO to investigate and determine which specific systems were accessed, whether the individuals who accessed the sensitive information had the appropriate security clearances, and whether guardrails are in place to protect economic and national security and Americans\u2019 privacy.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:53:43"}
