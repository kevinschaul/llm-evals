Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nLosing is the Wizards\u2019 way. It might also be their way out.\nThe Washington Wizards are in the middle of one of the worst seasons in NBA history.\nThey won just nine of their first 54 games before the all-star break and have the worst record in the NBA, 3\u00bd games behind the New Orleans Pelicans.\nThe season extends the franchise\u2019s struggles in the 21st century: The Wizards have the lowest winning percentage of all franchises since Jan. 1, 2000. They also haven\u2019t won at least 50 games in a season \u2014 the mark of a very good but not great team \u2014 since 1978-79.\n\nThe Wizards had been run by Ernie Grunfeld or his top lieutenant, Tommy Sheppard, since 2003. They <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/04/19/wizards-fire-tommy-sheppard/\" target=_blank>broke away from that tree</a> after the 2022-23 season in an organizational overhaul.\nWashington <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/05/24/michael-winger-wizards-general-manager/\" target=_blank>hired former Los Angeles Clippers general manager Michael Winger</a> as the president of Monumental Basketball, the group overseeing the Wizards, the WNBA\u2019s Washington Mystics and the G League\u2019s Capital City Go-Go. Winger <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/06/05/will-dawkins-wizards-general-manager/\" target=_blank>brought in General Manager Will Dawkins</a>, who previously worked with Winger with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nWeeks after the two were hired, they began an intense rebuild that included trading stars Bradley Beal and Kristaps Porzingis.\nAn oversimplified description of Washington\u2019s new strategy: Lose a lot, get high draft picks, accumulate young talent, and develop it into a winning core.\nThe Wizards won just 15 games in 2023-24. They\u2019re on pace for even fewer this season and have often lost by wide margins. Until recently, they were en route to having the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/01/30/wizards-lakers-lebron-james/\" target=_blank>worst average point differential</a> in NBA history.\nA recent positive stretch (more on that later) has bumped them up to third worst.\n\nWinger and Dawkins have overseen two drafts in D.C. They have made four first-round picks, including <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/26/wizards-deni-avdija-trade-trail-blazers/\" target=_blank>three last year</a>, and acquired another rookie this month <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/05/kyle-kuzma-trade-khris-middleton/\" target=_blank>in the Kyle Kuzma trade</a>.\nThe Wizards haven\u2019t been shy about playing their youth, believing in-game repetitions \u2014 going through the fire, as Coach Brian Keefe often puts it \u2014 is the best way to develop. Injuries to Kuzma and guard Malcolm Brogdon early this season increased the young players\u2019 minutes and roles.\n\nThe development process often has been ugly \u2014 as evidenced by two 16-game losing streaks, each tying the franchise record.\nWashington almost always has multiple players on the court who have yet to reach their physical primes or maximize their skills \u2014 players who are often committing youthful mistakes and undergoing growing pains. The Wizards have the NBA\u2019s worst offensive and defensive ratings (points scored and allowed per 100 possessions), per Basketball Reference.\nThose young players seem to be improving, an increased comfort somewhat evident in the Wizards\u2019 recent positive stretch. In February, the team jumped to 11th in offensive rating and 21st in defensive rating, per analytics site Cleaning the Glass. The month even featured a season-best three-game winning streak.\n\nBut Wizards fans probably don\u2019t want to see their team win <i>too much</i> over the final 28 games. Though the NBA flattened the lottery odds so the three worst teams have the same chance at netting the No. 1 draft pick, finishing worst means that team can fall only as far as fifth.\n\nThis season undoubtedly has been painful, evident in the red on all of these graphs. Winger, Dawkins and the rest of the organization hope the short-term struggles lead to a high draft pick and eventually the type of sustainable winner that has been absent in Washington for nearly 50 years."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:28:32"}
