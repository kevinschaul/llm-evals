U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, a Trump appointee, first entered a restraining order last week stopping the plan.\nOn Thursday, he told Justice Department employees to submit to him by Friday the steps it was taking to ensure overseas employees\u2019 safety and to indicate whether it would cover employees\u2019 other benefits, such as school or car payments, while they are on leave.\nNichols had set his original restraining order to expire at 11:59 p.m. Friday. He extended all the deadlines in the order by one week, while he drafts an opinion on whether to enjoin the spending shutdowns throughout the litigation. He amended the order to ban involuntary evacuations of USAID workers overseas, but not voluntary ones.\nLawyers on both sides were not fully clear last week how many USAID workers were affected. The government said in an affidavit that 2,140 employees had been placed on paid leave as of Feb. 7, replacing the 2,700 figure used in last week\u2019s hearing. The government said 98 percent of those placed on leave were stationed in the United States. The unions said Thursday USAID employs about 4,700 people, and about 1,400 live abroad.\nThe Trump administration has argued that it was merely pausing USAID spending while it examines whether the agency is pursuing Trump\u2019s agenda, and that some top aides were ousted for refusing directions to immediately stop funding. The employees\u2019 union said the pause has already damaged aid programs around the world and possibly placed employees in danger by not paying for their cellphones, internet or other security measures.\nThe suit marks the first major legal challenge to the push by President Donald Trump and his allies, led by billionaire Elon Musk and his U.S. DOGE Service, or Department of Government Efficiency, targeting foreign aid programs and USAID staff as part of their campaign<b> </b>to reshape the federal government. The lawsuit is one of several <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/06/trump-resistance-courts-democrats-musk/\" target=_blank>legal challenges mounted by Trump opponents</a> seeking to<b> </b>slow or halt the administration\u2019s barrage of actions to curtail spending, pare back the administrative state, eradicate diversity initiatives and more.\nThe judge\u2019s extension comes as the Trump administration grows increasingly defensive of the chaos caused by the halt in aid projects around the world.\nOn Thursday, the Trump administration sent an internal memo to USAID employees threatening to fire them if they communicated with the press about continued disruptions to foreign aid despite Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s issuing an exemption for \u201clifesaving humanitarian assistance\u201d last month.\n\u201c\ufeffThe purpose of this memo is to correct a false narrative in the press, and provide clarity for staff on external communications,\u201d wrote USAID official Mark Lloyd to staff in a memo obtained by The Washington Post.\nRubio\u2019s exemption \u201chas continued uninterrupted and was never paused,\u201d Lloyd added. \u201cUnauthorized engagement externally with the press or others is subject to discipline, including dismissal.\u201d\nLeading aid groups say even when they\u2019ve obtained exemptions, they cannot continue their work because Rubio\u2019s \u201cstop work\u201d order has effectively shut down payment systems required to draw down funds. That has resulted in thousands of aid workers and USAID contractors being furloughed, disrupting projects from Asia to Africa to Latin America.\nUSAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.\nIn another move this week, the White House fired the inspector general for USAID on Tuesday after he released a blistering report saying $489 million in food assistance was at risk of spoilage or potential diversion because of the funding freeze and work stoppage.\nThe Trump administration is \u201cengaged in a wholesale and rapid campaign to dissolve the USAID in its entirety,\u201d said attorney Karla Gilbride, representing both the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees. \u201cThat campaign has begun with the freezing of all funding on USAID projects.\u201d\nNichols immediately interjected, saying, \u201cAs I understand it, all funding on all projects is not frozen.\u201d\nGilbride said the government\u2019s claims do \u201cnot match the reality on the ground,\u201d in which bills are not being paid and employees are operating in an information vacuum as USAID leadership in Washington is upended. \u201cIt is not consistent with the declaration that this is just a \u2018pencils down\u2019 pause. Which is what a 90-day review suggested.\u201d\nThe unions have argued that USAID is a body created by Congress, and a law passed last year requires the president to notify and consult Congress if it intends to \u201creorganize or redesign, eliminate, consolidate or downsize any agency,\u201d Gilbride said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary that the court impose the injunction and extend the temporary order so that the situation doesn\u2019t get worse,\u201d Gilbride said.\nWith a preliminary injunction, Nichols would not be making a final judgment on whether the USAID moves are legal. For now, he must decide whether irreparable harm will be caused if he doesn\u2019t issue the injunction while also considering the likelihood of whether the employees will prevail on the larger question.\nNichols seemed particularly concerned by a \u201cclearly harrowing situation\u201d in Democratic Republic of Congo, where USAID staff in Kinshasa had to evacuate due to civil unrest there but couldn\u2019t obtain any funds from Washington to do so, and wound up crossing the Congo River in small boats, leaving their homes and belongings behind.\nJustice Department attorney Eric Hamilton said the Trump administration was \u201ccommitted to every USAID employee\u2019s security, and everyone will be kept safe.\u201d\nHamilton said the Justice Department believes Trump acted within his authority under Article II of the Constitution, and \u201cEight foreign aid statutes recognize the need for presidential direction in this space. We think it\u2019s consistent with all of those authorities, that the president when he comes into office, on the first day to take brief stock to see that foreign aid is only let out consistent with his policy.\u201d\nHamilton added: \u201cWe don\u2019t think a reorganization has happened. It\u2019s a 90-day pause.\u201d But he noted Rubio did send a letter to Congress on Feb. 3 notifying them of the move.\n\u201cThat notice checks the box,\u201d Hamilton said of the requirement for the president to consult with Congress before remaking an agency. \u201cWe think the specifics of that consultation would be a political question.\u201d\nNichols raised the issue of whether the employees\u2019 complaints of mistreatment should be heard by a civil service board, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board, rather than a court. Harrison agreed. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s changing is whether they\u2019re doing work and having access to systems,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThis makes this very much a personnel dispute, not appropriate for federal district court.\u201d\nGilbride responded that going through civil service appeals can \u201ctake years to reach a conclusion. By the time the MSPB process goes through, many years may have passed and there will no longer be a USAID for individuals to return to. \u2026 The unions that are in this case are not seeking damages or back pay on behalf of their members. What they\u2019re seeking is that USAID not be unconstitutionally dissolved.\u201d\nThe extension comes as former U.S. officials who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations have become increasingly vocal about the ramifications of USAID\u2019s dismantling.\nOn Wednesday, more than 200 former officials wrote a letter to leaders of the House and Senate saying \u201cthe human suffering that these cutoffs have caused is catastrophic and heartbreaking.\u201d\n\u201cIn Kenya, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere, aid to survivors of torture was stopped in its tracks,\u201d said the officials, who include Michael Hayden, who headed the National Security Agency during the Bush administration; former CIA officer Bruce Riedel; former Middle East adviser Aaron David Miller; former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch; and others.\n\u201cChildren and adult victims of war and terror who have relied on the United States have been left without care. And in poorer countries around the world, thousands of women and girls will die in the next 90 days due to complications of childbirth that might otherwise have been avoided through interventions funded by Congress and administered by USAID,\u201d they wrote in the letter, obtained by The Post."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:33:53"}
