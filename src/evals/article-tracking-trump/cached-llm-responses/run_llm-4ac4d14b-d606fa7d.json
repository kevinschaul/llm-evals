Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nFAA targeting Verizon contract in favor of Musk\u2019s Starlink, sources say\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is close to canceling a $2.4 billion contract to overhaul a communications system that serves as the backbone of the nation\u2019s air traffic control system and awarding the work to Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink, according to two people briefed on the plans.\nThe move to cancel a major contract in favor of a venture led by Musk \u2014 who is leading<b> </b>President Donald Trump\u2019s disruptive<b> </b>overhaul of the federal government through the U.S. DOGE Service \u2014 would represent a significant test of protections against conflicts of interest in government projects. It would be an especially extraordinary step for the typically cautious FAA, whose systems are vital to the safety of millions of air travelers every day.\nThe existing contract was awarded to Verizon in 2023, with the aim of upgrading a platform that different air traffic control facilities and FAA offices use to communicate with one another.\nMusk has personally taken aim at Verizon on his social media platform X in recent days, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1894202642639061144\" target=_blank>saying on Monday</a>: \u201cThe Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.\u201d\nVerizon did not respond to a request for comment. Joseph Russo, a Verizon executive vice president, said at an event hosted by Barclays Bank on Tuesday that Starlink\u2019s efforts at FAA might be complementary to Verizon\u2019s. Verizon was offering the \u201creliability and performance\u201d that the FAA needed, and its system was expected to be operational soon, Russo said.\nThe FAA said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cno decisions have been made\u201d about the Verizon project.\nA team of employees from SpaceX, Starlink\u2019s parent company, has been working inside the FAA in recent days, charged by the Trump administration with helping modernize the agency\u2019s aging technology. Ted Malaska, one of them, shared a<a href=\"https://x.com/TedMalaska/status/1892705202576277926\" target=_blank> picture on X on Thursday</a> saying he was excited to be working with the FAA, and thanking Musk and Trump for their \u201cvision and focus on safety.\u201d\n\u201cI challenge anyone to question the honesty and my technical integrity on this matter,\u201d Malaska <a href=\"https://x.com/TedMalaska/status/1894787084663300535\" target=_blank>posted Wednesday</a>. \u201cI am working without biases for the safety of people that fly.\u201d\nSeveral of the SpaceX employees now have FAA email addresses, according to two people who have seen the addresses, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. FAA regulates SpaceX and has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/17/faa-spacex-fine-elon-musk-regulation/\" target=_blank>alleged</a> that the company has violated safety rules relating to its rocket launches.\nIn a statement Monday, the FAA said it was testing Starlink systems at facilities in New Jersey and Alaska, in hopes of providing more reliable connectivity in remote locations. Elements of the FAA\u2019s deliberations were previously reported by the Associated Press and Bloomberg News.\nTransportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369262913112\" target=_blank>on Fox News this week</a> that the government had been too slow to modernize its technology and that the new administration was ready to move quickly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at a year, year-and-a-half time frame and do massive upgrades, improve the systems, help air traffic controllers, keep our skies safer,\u201d Duffy said.\nBut the Starlink plan adds to Musk\u2019s existing conflicts of interest at the FAA relating to SpaceX, according to John P. Pelissero, the director of an ethics center at Santa Clara University.\nPelissero said it appears that \u201cbecause of Musk\u2019s current position in DOGE and his closeness to Trump he and his company are getting an advantage and getting a contract.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s looking out for the public interest here when you get the person who\u2019s cutting budgets and personnel from the FAA, suddenly trying to benefit from still another government contract?\u201d Pelissero said.\nThe Transportation Department, DOGE and SpaceX did not respond to questions on how the process of changing contractors has been handled and whether potential conflicts of interest have been reviewed. Trump has said Musk will not be permitted to participate in decisions that pose a conflict of interest.\nVerizon was tapped in 2023 to build a system called the FAA Enterprise Network Services Program or FENS, replacing a system that dates to 2002. The contract had a 15-year lifespan, and the system is intended to connect some 4,600 sites, according to the FAA.\nThe agency was scheduled to make a final decision on whether<b> </b>to start paying Verizon for the contract next month, said one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\nInstead, Musk\u2019s team determined the job should go to Starlink, the person said. But the process for unwinding a contract and awarding it to another company is lengthy and has not been followed in this case so far, the person said.\nSeveral senior FAA officials have refused to sign paperwork authorizing the switch,<b> </b>according to the person, who has been briefed on the internal deliberations and resulting fallout, so Musk\u2019s team is now seeking help from the acting administrator of the agency, Trump appointee Chris Rocheleau, and Duffy.\nOutside reviews of the FAA\u2019s technology have repeatedly concluded in recent years that it is woefully out of date and that the agency is too slow to make upgrades. A 2023 <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/NAS_safety_review_team_report.pdf\" target=_blank>safety review pointed to technological problems</a> as one factor that was creating \u201crisk\u201d in the aviation system, a problem the Verizon contract is supposed to help solve.\nJessica Tillipman, the associate dean for government and procurement law studies at George Washington University School of Law, said terminating a contract can be expensive, time consuming and could lead to litigation.\n\u201cWhen the government terminates a contract it\u2019s not like it shuts off the spigot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive to wind down a contract. It\u2019s very expensive and it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\nShe said negotiating a settlement can take a year.\nIn awarding a new contract, agencies must comply with the Competition and Contracting Act, which requires competition in government procurements. It does have some exceptions. Among those: national security, public interest or urgency, she said.\n\u201cBut the question is, how is it so urgent when you already had a contractor dealing with it?,\u201d said Tillipman, adding that there are many different guardrails within the federal acquisition system to make sure things are fair, transparent and efficient.\n\u201cHowever, in the last few weeks she said many of these guardrails have been tested, which will likely lead to litigation,\u201d she said.\n<i>Washington Post researcher Aaron Schaffer contributed to this report.</i>"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:58:35"}
