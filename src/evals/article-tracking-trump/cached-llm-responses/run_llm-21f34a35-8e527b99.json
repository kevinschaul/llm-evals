Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nHouse speaker suggests Democratic votes could be needed on debt ceiling\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) hinted that the GOP-led Congress may have to rely on Democrats to raise the debt ceiling this year in an interview during the House GOP retreat in Doral, Florida.\nThough Johnson and many Republicans would like to raise the debt ceiling with only Republican votes, the speaker blamed the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold for making that goal difficult. \u201cI think there\u2019s some concern in the Senate that might be difficult to do on a partisan basis,\u201d he said.\nSenate Republicans hold 53 seats, meaning they need seven Democrats to agree on passing bills that require a filibuster-proof majority. Republicans are hoping to use and approve of a budgetary maneuver \u2014 often referenced as \u201creconciliation\u201d \u2014 that would  lower the filibuster threshold to a simple majority to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. Some House Republicans would like to tack the debt ceiling onto the reconciliation process \u2014 which is expected to address border security, energy and tax changes \u2014 because it could be passed with GOP-only votes. But it\u2019s unclear whether the debt ceiling can be included under the strict budgetary parameters of reconciliation.\nHouse Republicans privately say they will need Democratic help, too, given that many fiscal hawks have pledged not to support raising the debt ceiling unless there are substantial spending cuts.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:21:32"}
