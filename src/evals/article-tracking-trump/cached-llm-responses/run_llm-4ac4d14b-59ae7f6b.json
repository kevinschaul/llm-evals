Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nActing ICE director removed amid White House pressure to boost arrests\nThe Trump administration has removed the top official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement one month into his tenure, as White House officials have become <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/ice-arrests-immigration-deportations/\" target=_blank>increasingly frustrated</a> that the agency isn\u2019t arresting immigrants fast enough to satisfy the president\u2019s deportation goals.\nCaleb Vitello, a veteran ICE official who was installed as acting director when President Donald Trump took office, will be reassigned to a senior role overseeing daily enforcement operations, according to Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. She did not say who would replace him.\nTrump has ordered ICE to carry out the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/interactive/2025/trump-immigrants-mass-deportations/?itid=ap_nickmiroff_9\" target=_blank>largest mass deportation campaign</a> in U.S. history and quickly ramp up the number of immigrants it arrests each day. Despite the administration dedicating a rush of resources to the effort that has included sending thousands of troops to the southern border and assigning thousands of agents and officers from the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies, ICE\u2019s budget and staffing remain largely unchanged, leaving officers scrambling to meet aggressive arrest quotas.\nIn late January, Vitello told ICE\u2019s 25 field office directors they should arrest at least 75 immigrants per day for a national <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/26/ice-arrests-raids-trump-quota/\" target=_blank>daily total of 1,200 to 1,500</a>. ICE officers have been working six and even seven days a week since then, but Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem and Trump \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan have blamed agency officials for falling far short of those goals. Homan did not respond to requests for comment.\nLouisiana Secretary of Wildlife and Fisheries<b> </b>Madison Sheahan, a former campaign aide to Noem, is expected to become acting deputy director of ICE, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a position that hadn\u2019t been publicly announced. Sheahan was also <a href=\"https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2023/01/19/sheahan-named-executive-director-sd-gop/\" target=_blank>executive director</a> of the South Dakota GOP. A DHS official said that \u201cpositions are being reevaluated\u201d and that the agency had \u201cnothing new to announce at this time.\u201d\nICE averaged more than 800 arrests per day nationwide in late January in the 10 days after Trump took office, publishing its results on social media amid a publicity campaign that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/28/new-york-city-ice-raid/\" target=_blank>invited television crews</a> to embed with officers. The pace of arrests slowed during the first two weeks of February to fewer than 600 daily, and ICE stopped publishing data on social media, saying it would move to a monthly format.\nCurrent and former ICE officials said the enforcement blitz in late January depleted the lists of targets ICE developed before Trump took office with the names, addresses and other data on immigrants they could arrest. Officer teams have not had time to build out new target lists.\nOfficers have also struggled to meet their quotas because many immigrants are refusing to open their doors when ICE officers knock, according to three ICE officials. Noem has accused FBI agents of leaking sensitive information about upcoming immigration enforcement operations, which the law enforcement agency has pushed back on.<b> </b>The enforcement teams generally do not possess criminal arrest warrants that would allow them to force their way into their targets\u2019 residences. ICE officials say they can\u2019t afford to leave teams of officers waiting for targeted immigrants to leave their homes.\nVitello\u2019s demotion follows the reassignment this month of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/11/ice-enforcement-officials-reassigned/\" target=_blank>top two officials at ICE\u2019s enforcement division</a>.\nA Trump administration official said that Vitello will now oversee field and enforcement operations as part of an effort to expand the team. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the personnel move, said Noem made the decision and it was not done at Trump\u2019s direction.\nVitello\u2019s removal was first reported Friday by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ice-leadership-changes-trump-deportations-1856e1bb\" target=_blank>The Wall Street Journal</a>. Several ICE staffers said news of his demotion caught them by surprise, and they found out through news alerts.\nJason Houser, chief of staff for ICE under President Joe Biden, said that the White House is asking ICE to \u201cdefy the math\u201d and do things that are \u201cunrealistic.\u201d\n\u201cThe White House needs to look in the mirror,\u201d Houser said. \u201cThe dysfunction isn\u2019t with ICE rank-and-file who are trying to do their jobs effectively.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has sought to take an<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/ice-arrests-immigration-deportations/\" target=_blank> all-of-government approach </a>to immigration enforcement, treating it as a near wartime effort. At least 3,600 servicemen and servicewomen have been sent to the border, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/border-soldiers-texas-migrants-trump/\" target=_blank>according to the </a>Defense Department. The administration has used military planes to transport migrants to locations as far away as India. As ICE has run out of space in its detention centers, the Trump administration has started to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/16/trump-guantanamo-migrants-deportations-venezuela/\" target=_blank>send migrants to the Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base in Cuba</a>, where Trump ordered the construction of a detention camp with 30,000 beds. On Thursday, 177 Venezuelan migrants  at Guant\u00e1namo were <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/20/guantanamo-migrants-trump-deportations-honduras/\" target=_blank>deported</a> to their homeland.\nHoman has said he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with the results so far. Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) said recently that Homan came to the Hill \u201cbegging\u201d for additional money. The Senate adopted a budget blueprint early Friday  for legislation to increase border security and immigration enforcement by $175 billion. Trump has backed a competing, more expansive plan in the House.\nThe Biden administration deported 271,000 people in fiscal year 2024, the highest annual total in a decade. Deportations during Trump\u2019s first term reached a peak of about 267,000 during the 2019 fiscal year, even as he made similar promises. ICE would need to deport more than 2,700 people a day to hit 1 million deportations a year, a goal that veteran immigration officials say is improbable."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:59:37"}
