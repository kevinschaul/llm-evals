Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nIn new order, Trump administration places more USAID staff on leave\nThe Trump administration put scores of additional employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave Tuesday, dealing a further blow to the beleaguered aid agency.\nIn a new letter, Pete Marocco, who was appointed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a senior agency official, told affected USAID personnel they were being put on a paid \u201cexcused absence\u201d effective immediately.\n\u201cDuring the period that you are on administrative leave you are not to enter USAID premises, access USAID systems, or attempt to use your position or authority with USAID in any way without my prior permission or prior permission of a supervisor in your chain of command,\u201d Marocco said in the letter, copies of which were obtained by The Washington Post.\nIt was not immediately clear how many employees were affected. One USAID official said the number could be as high as 1,400.\nThe move is the latest action since Trump\u2019s return to the White House impacting USAID employees, many of whom have been furloughed or forced out of their jobs, and America\u2019s overseas assistance programs, many of which were suspended while the new administration conducts a review of USAID\u2019s activities.\nThe campaign to overhaul \u2014 and potentially abolish \u2014 USAID has been led by billionaire Elon Musk, who is advising Trump in his effort to shrink the federal government. Musk has tweeted that USAID \u201cmust die.\u201d\nPlacing officials on administrative leave has hamstrung large parts of USAID just as humanitarian groups around the world seek exemptions to Trump\u2019s 90-day aid freeze. Officials who received the letter were immediately locked out of emails and unable to manage the flood of exemption requests, a bottleneck that aid workers say has prevented life-saving aid projects from restarting across the developing world.\nUSAID did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDemocrats have vowed to fight any attempt to dismantle the agency, citing its creation in statute. A Democratic Senate aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Tuesday\u2019s move to put additional staff on leave was \u201csweeping in nature.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:39:12"}
