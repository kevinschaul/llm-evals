Spencer Cox (R) last week after both chambers passed it largely along party lines. If signed into law, the <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0081.html\" target=_blank>bill</a> would prohibit adding fluoride to public water systems and would bar cities and counties from requiring the mineral in their water.\nOpponents of the measure <a href=\"https://www.uda.org/government-affairs/fluoride\" target=_blank>argue </a>that it infringes on communities\u2019 right to decide whether to use the cavity-fighting mineral and that it<b> </b>departs from decades of science demonstrating fluoride\u2019s enamel-strengthening, tooth-decay-combating benefits \u2014 particularly for children. The bill\u2019s supporters <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1A1s1VDW9y/\" target=_blank>contend</a> that it would prevent the government from medicating the public without its consent.\nThe governor has not publicly indicated whether he supports the bill, and his office did not immediately respond to request for comment on Tuesday. The Republican governor, who occasionally <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/03/23/utah-cox-transgender-athlete-veto/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwY2xjawIrMrVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHZD5IgYgTW1mXm3PPM2X3SeBkNNMqArWGTijzUvNjiZbzxekMCUE2Mmxkg_aem_NA3_iem9lK2GmT-Rb8ocXw\" target=_blank>breaks </a>from party lines, has until the end of March to sign or veto the bill; if he takes no action, it will lapse into law.\nUtah\u2019s potentially unprecedented move comes at a time of renewed attention to the practice of adding fluoride to drinking water: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/14/robert-f-kennedy-jr-hhs-secretary/\" target=_blank>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, the newly appointed Health and Human Services secretary, has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/03/rfk-jr-trump-fluoride-water/\" target=_blank>assailed </a>the practice, alleging that it can harm brain development and bones.\nWhile this isn\u2019t the first time communities have fought over fluoride, which was first used in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the issue has historically been hyperlocal, rather than partisan. Democrat-majority<b> </b>states, such as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/20/rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-oregon/\" target=\"_blank\">Oregon </a>and New Jersey, have some of the lowest fluoridation rates, while states where Republicans predominate, including Kentucky and South Carolina, boast some of the highest.\nMost Americans drink fluoridated water, including about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2024/fluoride-water-mandates/\" target=_blank>half of Utah residents</a>. The process of adjusting fluoride quantities to recommended levels \u2014 known as community water fluoridation \u2014 reduces oral health disparities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most communities that add the mineral do so voluntarily, but about a dozen states require fluoridation. Some of those mandates have been in place for more than 50 years.\nIn Utah, residents who receive fluoridated water \u2014 in Salt Lake County, Davis County and Brigham City \u2014 experience tooth decay at rates 25 to 50 percent lower than other residents, according to the Utah Dental Association. The group blasted the bill, urging residents to call Cox\u2019s office to demand a veto.\n\u201cHouse Bill 81 would adopt public policy that is in complete opposition to effectively decreasing dental decay and strengthening teeth enamel,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.uda.org/government-affairs/call-to-governor-cox-to-veto-hb-81\" target=_blank>the group said</a>.\nThe group\u2019s national counterpart, the American Dental Association, sent a letter to Cox on Tuesday to similarly urge a veto.\n\u201cUtah would be the only state to end this preventive health practice that has been in place for over three quarters of a century,\u201d the group <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/-/media/Project/ADA%20Organization/ADA/ADA-org/Files/Advocacy/Prevention%20and%20Education/utah_cwf_bill_veto_letter_20250225.pdf\" target=_blank>wrote</a>. \u201cThe Utah measure proposes to take the unprecedented step of ending one of the most trusted and tested public health strategies in the arsenal of preventive medicine.\u201d\nUtah Rep. Stephanie Gricius (R), the bill\u2019s sponsor, said the legislation is about choice.\n\u201cCommunity water fluoridation does not allow for informed consent which is a crucial component of good, healthcare policy,\u201d she wrote in an email to The Washington Post, adding that she is \u201chopeful\u201d that Cox will sign the bill, \u201cgiven the broad support from both legislative bodies.\u201d\nDays before the presidential election, Kennedy signaled that a<b> </b>future Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/03/rfk-jr-trump-fluoride-water/\" target=\"_blank\">would advise</a> water districts to remove fluoride, which he <a href=\"https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923\" target=\"_blank\">referred to</a> as \u201can industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease.\u201d Medical organizations said Kennedy\u2019s assertions are unfounded; Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-banning-vaccines-president-rfk-fluoride-rcna178570\" target=\"_blank\">supported</a> the idea.\nThe federal government<b> </b>does not mandate fluoridation or directly control local water systems, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2024/fluoride-water-mandates/\" target=_blank>experts have said</a> the Trump administration could influence communities across the country to reconsider decades-old fluoridation programs.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:14:02"}
