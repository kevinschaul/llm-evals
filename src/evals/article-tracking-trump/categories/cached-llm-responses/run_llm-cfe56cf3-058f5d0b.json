Reyes of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia tore into the attorneys for the plaintiffs in a brief but heated hearing on Friday afternoon.\nReyes demanded to know why the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys waited 21 days after the firings <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/12/trump-fired-inspectors-general-lawsuit/\" target=_blank>to file their lawsuit</a>, only to then seek emergency same-day relief. She ticked off the list of emergency actions that have flooded the federal dockets and then limited the attorneys to \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d answers.\nShe also objected to the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel comparing the facts of their case to those of Hampton Dellinger, the fired head of the Office of Special Counsel who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/10/trump-office-of-special-counsel-firing-lawsuit/3195b7de-e7ce-11ef-969b-cfbefacb1eb3_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">sued the Trump administration last week</a>. Dellinger argued in his complaint that his termination violated a law that shields the leaders of independent agencies from removal by the president. The inspectors general, however, are arguing that their firing was illegal because Trump did not give Congress 30 days\u2019 notice of his decision as required by law.\nAfter forcing the plaintiffs to withdraw their motion for a temporary restraining order, the parties agreed to an expedited schedule. The government must reply to the lawsuit by Feb. 21.\n\u201cWhy on earth this could not have been decided in a five-minute phone call is beyond me,\u201d Reyes said. She said she considered sanctioning the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys but had more pressing matters on her docket."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Firing government watchdogs", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 15:45:02"}
