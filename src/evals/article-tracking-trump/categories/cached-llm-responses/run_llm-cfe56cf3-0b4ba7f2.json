It also tasked federal agencies to review their rules, while revoking an order issued under President Joe Biden designed to improve safeguards on the financial technology.\nTrump signed the executive order just days after he widely promoted a new cryptocurrency project that quickly soared in value, potentially generating billions of dollars, in a move that sparked fresh concerns about his commingling of public office and personal business.\nIn a radical departure from his first term, Trump last year began to align himself with the nation\u2019s crypto elite, who eagerly backed his candidacy in a bid to secure a more favorable regulatory environment in Washington. Appearing at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Trump even promised to turn the United States into the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet,\u201d particularly by pursuing policy \u201cwritten by people who love your industry.\u201d\nAfter he won the White House, the president sought advice from crypto investors including Marc Andreessen, and he tapped fellow Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks to help guide crypto policy in the administration. Trump also nominated Paul Atkins, a veteran regulator who has consulted for crypto firms, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Crypto", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 13:09:24"}
