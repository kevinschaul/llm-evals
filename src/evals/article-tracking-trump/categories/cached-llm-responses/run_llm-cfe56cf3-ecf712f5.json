He is expected to be replaced on a temporary basis by Melanie Krause, who has also served in senior positions at the tax agency, the people said. President Trump has nominated <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/05/billy-long-irs-commissioner-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">Billy Long</a>, a former Republican congressman from Missouri, to run the agency on a more permanent basis, if he is confirmed by the Senate.\nO\u2019Donnell\u2019s expected departure comes at a pivotal time for the IRS, which faces a crush from tax filing season and fresh scrutiny from Musk\u2019s team.\nThe people familiar with the matter said O\u2019Donnell was concerned by many of the moves Musk made on the government, including firing probationary employees. As part of Musk-driven cuts, about 7,000 IRS employees are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/20/irs-layoffs-trump-firings-doge/\" target=_blank>expected to lose their jobs</a>, a person familiar with the matter has said. O\u2019Donnell was also widely expected to retire sometime this year, people familiar with the matter said.\nThe White House also has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/16/doge-irs-access-taxpayer-data/\" target=_blank>been working on a memorandum of understanding</a> to give DOGE officials broad access to IRS systems, property and databases. The draft would require DOGE to maintain the confidentiality of tax return information, but was still viewed by IRS officials as highly unusual.\nO\u2019Donnell\u2019s anticipated resignation was first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/politics/acting-irs-commissioner-retire.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a>. Spokespeople for the Treasury Department and IRS did not immediately return requests for comment. Efforts to locate contact information for O\u2019Donnell directly were not immediately successful Monday night.\nO\u2019Donnell\u2019s exit follows the departure of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/31/elon-musk-treasury-department-payment-systems/\" target=_blank>David A. Lebryk</a>, who had been the highest-ranking civil servant in the Treasury Department, over DOGE\u2019s request for access to the department\u2019s sensitive payment systems."], "kwargs": {}, "result": "DOGE", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 15:45:05"}
