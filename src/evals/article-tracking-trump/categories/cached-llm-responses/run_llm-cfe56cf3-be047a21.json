The agency is responsible for education research, evaluation of programs and collection of a vast amount of data about American schools.\nThe vast majority of the work of this agency is done by contractors, so canceling their work will have a significant impact on its ability to function, they said.\nThe canceled contracts were identified by a team of workers from the Department of Government Efficiency service, known as DOGE. The list includes some functions required by statutes.\nNotices to contractors were sent Monday, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak. He said they were canceled \u201cfor convenience,\u201d a provision that allows for a contract to be terminated without finding fault.\nMadi Biedermann, spokeswoman for the department, said three popular programs run by the research arm of the agency were spared: the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a set of nationally representative tests to measure student progress over time, the College Scorecard and the College Navigator.\nBiedermann said the canceled contracts would be rebid in hopes of getting the same or better work done at a lower cost. She said she did not know how or why DOGE concluded that these particular contractors are overpaid or underdelivering.\n\u201cThe significant amount of money as compared to the outcomes generated for students is not commensurate,\u201d she said. She said they are \u201clooking for vendors to generate better outcomes for students.\u201d\nAsked how DOGE workers have the requisite expertise to make these determinations, she said, \u201cThe entire goal of DOGE is to cut waste, and they have been trained to identify that.\u201d\nBiedermann said 90 contracts worth $900 million were canceled. The second official said the list included 167 contracts.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Department of Education", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 13:09:36"}
