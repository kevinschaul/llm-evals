Administration officials, seeking to project strength, put them in a prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay that has been used to house suspected terrorists after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, saying that an initial wave was all from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\nHegseth is expected to highlight the mission and how it is taking shape, said the military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Some troops at Guant\u00e1namo Bay were informed of the visit on Tuesday, one of the officials said.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Guant\u00e1namo Bay", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 13:09:03"}
