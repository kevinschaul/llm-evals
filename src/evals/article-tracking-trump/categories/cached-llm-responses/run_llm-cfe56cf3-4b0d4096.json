Ali gave the government until 11:59 p.m. Wednesday to fulfill its contractual obligations and restart payments to contractors whose work in impoverished parts of the world had been largely stopped during an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/21/usaid-trump-freeze-food-foreign-aid/\">ongoing legal battle</a>. Administration officials must also provide examples of communication sent to partners on the ground about resuming assistance, Ali ruled.\nHis order applies to work done before Feb. 13.\nAid groups that are plaintiffs in the case provided evidence that the government has not lifted its suspension of funding, Ali said, and the defendants did not rebut that Tuesday.\nThe administration filed a notice of appeal late Tuesday afternoon. A spokesman has said officials will not discuss the pending litigation outside of court.\nDuring the contentious 90-minute hearing, Justice Department lawyer Indraneel Sur told Ali he was \u201cnot in a position to answer\u201d whether the Trump administration had taken needed steps to allow the assistance to begin moving. Sur said the administration would provide further details in a status report due at noon Wednesday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t get a straight answer from you,\u201d Ali responded. \u201cWe are now 12 days in. You can\u2019t answer me whether any of the funds \u2026 covered by the court\u2019s order have been unfrozen?\u201d\nThe total amount owed to organizations by the U.S. Agency for International Development was not immediately clear, but one development group, DAI Global LLC, said in court filings that it is owed more than $115 million. Separately, the U.N. World Food Program \u2014 the largest distributor of food aid \u2014 is owed more than $820 million, officials confirmed this week.\nMore than 10 days of delays have wreaked havoc on some of the world\u2019s poorest and sickest communities. People with HIV have lost access to lifesaving medicines. Those in famine-stricken areas of Sudan and other countries <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/\">are without food</a>.\nIn an emergency request Monday, the partner organizations said they face possible eviction and threats to worker safety because of the administration\u2019s ongoing defiance of Ali\u2019s federal court order.\n\u201cWhat the government has revealed is that the government has done nothing to make the flow of payments happen,\u201d Stephen K. Wirth, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, said in court.\nThe groups allege that instead of complying with Ali\u2019s directive, the Trump administration \u201cchose to take a series of new actions\u201d around access to a key reimbursement system, adding new approval processes and terminating \u201chundreds of critical personnel\u201d \u2014 \u201call but halting the disbursement of foreign-assistance funds,\u201d according to their emergency motion.\nDespite the State Department <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/28/state-department-foreign-aid-trump-waiver/\">granting a waiver</a> for certain lifesaving aid to resume, the plaintiffs contend, the payment system remains down, with employees seeing a variety of error messages when they try to submit invoices. Many organizations have not been paid for expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2024, before Trump returned to the White House.\nShould the government not comply by Ali\u2019s new deadline, \u201cwe are in uncharted and dangerous territory,\u201d Lauren Bateman, another attorney for the plaintiffs, noted via email after Tuesday\u2019s hearing.\nThe case is among several in which legal experts say the administration has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/20/trump-judge-orders-comply-defy-usaid/\">come close</a> to the red line of disobeying judicial orders as Trump and his allies assert vast<b> </b>presidential powers.\nThousands of federal workers have lost their jobs in recent weeks, adding to the chaos. On Sunday, the administration sent notices that it would <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/\">eliminate</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/\"><b> </b></a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/\">1,600 jobs at USAID</a> and place all but a small number of the remaining employees on leave, after a different federal judge ruled that the job-cutting efforts could move forward.\nAid advocates believe the Trump administration is determined to dismantle USAID, the chief U.S. agency for foreign assistance, which provides $40 billion in help each year. The president and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have both derided the diplomats\u2019 work, with Trump calling them \u201cradical lunatics\u201d and Musk vowing USAID must \u201cdie.\u201d\n<i>Aaron Schaffer contributed to this report.</i>"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Foreign aid", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 15:44:57"}
