Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Wednesday, installing a new board of trustees as he furthers his executive authority to remake one of the nation\u2019s premier cultural institutions.\nThe Kennedy Center\u2019s new board is composed of Trump loyalists, including White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance, former transportation secretary Elaine Chao and Trump himself, <a href=\"https://www.kennedy-center.org/about-us/leadership/trustees/\" target=_blank>according to its website</a>.\n\u201cIt is a Great Honor to be Chairman of The Kennedy Center, especially with this amazing Board of Trustees. We will make The Kennedy Center a very special and exciting place!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, noting he was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/02/12/trump-elected-kennedy-center-board-chair/\" target=_blank>voted in as chairman</a> unanimously.\nTrump\u2019s recasting of the Kennedy Center board breaks from tradition.
