The White House Office of Management and Budget issued guidance Tuesday that the order was not supposed to impact programs such as Head Start, yet access to funding appears to have been frozen.\nThese funds \u2014 which must be spent within two days of when they are requested \u2014 are used to pay for everything from staff salary to utility bills, said Donna Davidson, president and CEO of Easter Seals North Georgia, a Head Start provider.\n\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t correct itself fairly quickly, we\u2019re going to have to close,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cWe are hoping that this was an error, but we\u2019re already on Tuesday, payroll is on Friday. We have to be able to draw down that money to make payroll.\u201d\nClosing would mean that staffers, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck, would lose their income, and parents who rely on the program would need to figure out alternative child-care arrangements or stay home from work, Davidson said. So far, she said, providers have gotten no guidance from OMB or the federal Head Start agency offices on when access would be reinstated or what to do in the meantime.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Federal funding", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 13:09:34"}
