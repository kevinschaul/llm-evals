The third order seeks to combat antisemitism in schools.\nFor years, Republicans including President Donald Trump have attacked schools for teaching a basket of ideas about systemic racism labeled critical race theory. Trump has also attacked schools for policies and lessons that recognize and respect transgender students.\nFederal law allows the agency to withhold federal funds from any school that discriminates based on race. Trump and his allies argue that lessons about systemic racism amount to discrimination, because they presume certain things about people based on race, such as that White Americans enjoy certain privileges based on their race. They say that giving rights to transgender students, especially transgender girls and women, discriminates against cisgender girls and women by forcing them to share spaces and sports teams.\nThe order also reinstates the<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/02/trump-1776-commission-education/\" target=_blank> 1776 Commission</a>, which Trump created just a week before the 2020 presidential election to promote \u201cpatriotic education.\u201d The commission wrote a report that was published in the final days of his first term. The report came under heavy fire from historians as a distortion of American history, and President Joe Biden disbanded the panel as one of his first acts. As a candidate, Trump promised to reinstate the commission if reelected.\n<i>Cleve R.
