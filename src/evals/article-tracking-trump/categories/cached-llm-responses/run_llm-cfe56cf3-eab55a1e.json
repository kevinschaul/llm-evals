But that information is some of the most heavily guarded data in the federal government. Political officials do not have access to the Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS. The IRS\u2019s commissioner, national taxpayer advocate and even senior officials in the office of the chief information officer do not have IDRS access either.\nThe IRS was prepared to reject the White House\u2019s request, the people said, on the grounds that allowing DOGE to have the information would put millions of taxpayers\u2019 information at risk. But over the course of the week, Treasury officials recognized the broad nature of DOGE\u2019s request and agreed to limit Kliger\u2019s access, the people said.\nRepresentatives for the White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nDOGE has sought entry to several highly sensitive data systems across the government. The group sought access to the Treasury Department\u2019s payment systems; the career official who was in charge of that program resigned rather than grant the request. He was later replaced by a DOGE staffer on assignment to Treasury.\nDOGE is also attempting to gain access to Social Security Administration datasets, which include the world\u2019s largest repository of medical data and years of history on social safety net payments and employment histories. The acting Social Security administrator resigned late last week after clashing with DOGE officials over that request.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "DOGE", "cached_at": "2025-04-21 13:09:42"}
