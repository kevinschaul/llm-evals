        "content": "As GOP lawmakers in Washington try to protect a key food aid program from the Trump administration\u2019s cutbacks, international humanitarian organizations say the ongoing disruptions<b> </b>in assistance are devastating countries that are on the verge of famine.\nThe administration\u2019s move in late January to gut the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/01/foreign-aid-freeze-state-department-usaid/\" target=_blank>laying off thousands of workers</a> and freezing funding<b> </b>in more than 100 countries \u2014 immediately jeopardized Food for Peace. For more than 70 years, the $2 billion program has purchased surplus commodities from American farmers for distribution overseas.\nLate Thursday, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered administration officials to temporarily lift their freeze on U.S. aid and development programs abroad. He alluded to the \u201cshockwave\u201d caused by their action and said they \u201chave not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid \u2026 was a rational precursor to reviewing programs.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump and top adviser Elon Musk, a tech billionaire, have been highly critical of USAID\u2019s work, with Trump baselessly claiming the agency had committed \u201ctremendous fraud.\u201d \nDespite a State Department waiver for emergency food assistance, those shipments still had been delayed around the world, a USAID inspector general wrote in a report Monday \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/11/trump-fires-usaid-inspector-general/\" target=_blank>a day before he was dismissed</a>. The bottleneck, Paul K. Martin wrote, put more than $489 million in food assistance at risk of spoilage or theft as it waited at ports, in transit and in warehouses.\nIn defending itself in court, Ali noted, the government acknowledged that the waiver process \u201cmay have had \u2018hiccups.\u2019\u201d\nAid groups had said Thursday that some food deliveries were starting to move through shipping channels but that millions more pounds of corn, lentils and pinto beans remained stuck because the agency\u2019s payment system was not functioning.\nThe waiver for lifesaving assistance that was in place before the judge\u2019s order was \u201ctheoretical\u201d because \u201cthe payment system that reimburses partners for expenses they incur is offline,\u201d said Sarah Charles, former head of USAID\u2019s Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, which oversaw the Food for Peace program. Some relief agencies are still owed for services rendered in December and January, she added.\nAt a contentious meeting at the State Department, the Trump appointee tasked with overseeing USAID \u2014 or what is left of it \u2014 had assured aid workers and congressional staff that aid payments would resume early next week. But Peter Marocco also said that a department review of the agency\u2019s remaining projects was underway and that those that do not \u201cgive the president real influence\u201d will be cut, according to a readout of the event obtained by The Washington Post.\nA department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\nComplicating the administration\u2019s narrative is a growing tide of Republican lawmakers and former officials who say it\u2019s not quite accurate.\nAndrew Natsios, who served as USAID administrator during the George W. Bush administration, told lawmakers this week that even those relief organizations already granted waivers haven\u2019t been able to \u201cissue checks\u201d and keep working because of the shutdown of USAID\u2019s payment system.\nThat includes Christian humanitarian groups, which receive $1 billion a year, Natsios said at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing<b> </b>Thursday. The session was meant to highlight what Trump and his allies say is USAID\u2019s wasteful spending but instead underscored concerns about the flow of critical assistance, as two of the three expert witnesses warned of dire consequences for U.S. interests and national security if the aid did not resume soon.\nSen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), who has urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \u201cquickly ship and distribute\u201d the American-grown food assistance, is among those questioning what\u2019s happening on the ground.\nMoran said the State Department last weekend had notified participating groups that they could restart operations. He is skeptical that there has been much impact so far. \u201cMy impression is that waivers were granted, but then it doesn\u2019t seem like it was making a significant difference,\u201d he told The Post.\n\nHe is working with Rep. Tracey Mann (R), a fellow Kansan, and other lawmakers to protect Food for Peace by moving it to the U.S. Department of Agriculture as \u201cpart of an ongoing effort to save money and increase efficiency,\u201d Moran said in a statement. That proposal has gained widespread support from agricultural groups.\nFounded in Kansas, Food for Peace was signed into law in 1954 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It has long been championed by the state\u2019s leaders, including former senator Robert J. Dole, and has helped more than 4 billion people in over 150 countries since its inception.\nThe program is a source of pride for farmers. But it has been criticized over the years for various issues, including the potential to undermine local agriculture in recipient countries and exacerbate conflicts in war-torn areas, according to Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute.\nEven if the lawmakers prevail, the program\u2019s ultimate survival is not guaranteed.\nNick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, pointed to the USDA\u2019s new secretary. Brooke Rollins, former head of a conservative Texas think tank, was confirmed Thursday.\n\u201cWhat happens if she goes into this office cleaning house?\u201d Levendofsky asked. \u201cAnd what about when Elon Musk comes over to USDA? Anything is to be expected at this point.\u201d\nKansas is the country\u2019s biggest grower of sorghum, and millions of bushels of the high-protein grain are backed up in warehouses across the state. Kim Barnes, chief financial officer of the Pawnee County Cooperative Association, a grain trader in central Kansas, said he\u2019s storing more than 1.3 million bushels of sorghum because of a market downturn over the last year \u2014 a situation that will only worsen with USAID cutbacks.\nIt\u2019s a shame, he said, adding: \u201cThere are still countries that need it.\u201d\nOn Thursday, a different federal judge <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/13/usaid-workers-trump-leave-ruling/\" target=_blank>extended a block</a> on the Trump administration\u2019s plan to place thousands of USAID employees on leave. But with thousands of contractors already<i><b> </b></i>fired, the agency\u2019s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance could ultimately lose more than 90 percent of its workforce, Martin, the inspector general, wrote. That outcome exacerbates concerns about whether any existing staff can work with locals on the ground to distribute the commodities, he added.\nThe <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">temporary gap in supplies has been \u201cdevastating\u201d</a> some countries, said Paul Spiegel, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health and former chief of public health in the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\u201cThere has already been much damage done that will be difficult to undo,\u201d Spiegel said Friday. \u201cThe administration has not always done what they said they would do providing exceptions for humanitarian response, so the question remains: Will they allow funds to go out, or will they simply slow it down and the pain and suffering of all these vulnerable people around the globe will continue?\u201d\nDuaa Tarig, who worked as an art curator in Sudan before war broke out, said she personally knew three people who recently died of malnutrition in her Khartoum neighborhood.\nThe pattern is familiar. During a 10-day period last year, many died when soup kitchens in the city were forced to shutter for lack of funding, she recounted. Weakened by starvation, individuals succumbed quickly to malaria or dengue fever.\nWith USAID funding curtailed, more than 80 percent of those soup kitchens have closed again, she said. Many of those remaining open are unable to afford the lentils they usually buy and are scraping together vegetable soups.\n\u201cEveryone, including myself, have lost a lot of weight. Some have lost more than half their body weight. I see the faces of people I used to know and I can\u2019t recognize them \u2014 they are just bone and skin,\u201d she said.\n<i>Houreld reported from Nairobi.

        "content": "The notices popped into email boxes all over the country Monday afternoon, notifying researchers who collect, analyze and study data on the American education system that their contracts were terminated, effective immediately. No reason was given.\nThe nixed contracts support the Institute for Education Sciences at the Education Department, known as IES,<b> </b>and inside the agency, staff questioned whether the cuts were legal, much less justified.\nBut the decisions were not made by the institute\u2019s leaders or education experts. Rather, the canceled contracts were all on a list drawn up by a U.S. DOGE Service team that is working to unravel the Education Department, stripping the agency of staff, terminating contracts and \u2014 soon \u2014 canceling program grants, according to people familiar with DOGE activity who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re completely crippled,\u201d said one IES employee. \u201cIt really prevents us from serving the mission we thought we were carrying out.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump has made clear he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/\">wants the Education Department shuttered</a>. Absent congressional action to do that, his administration is at work dismantling it on its own.\nOn Wednesday, at least 50 recently hired employees who were on probation were abruptly dismissed without cause across the department, according to union leaders. Staff have been warned that layoffs are coming. And managers inside the agency have been instructed to identify workers who can be converted to a new job status that would strip them of some worker protections, according to a person with direct knowledge of the order.\nIn addition, DOGE caused about 100 Education Department employees to be put on administrative leave for their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/10/education-department-dei-devos/\">mostly tangential</a> connections to diversity, equity and inclusion<b> </b>programs, based on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/22/dei-federal-employees-trump/\">Trump\u2019s executive order</a> to rid the federal government of DEI offices and initiatives. And in <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/\">an executive order</a> Tuesday, Trump instructed departments heads across the government to hire no more than one employee for every four employees who depart, and to plan for mass layoffs.\n\u201cThe inmates are running the asylum, and the goal is chaos and the goal is destruction,\u201d Arne Duncan, who served as education secretary in the Obama administration, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this in our lifetime.\u201d\nOn Friday, the department announced another round of cancellations: $336 million in canceled contracts for Regional Educational Laboratories, which help states apply evidence-based practices to teaching and that <a href=\"https://www.the74million.org/article/from-covid-learning-loss-to-artificial-intelligence-education-rd-cant-wait/\" target=\"_blank\">have been praised</a> by the former Tennessee schools chief who Trump nominated as deputy secretary of education.\nThe cancellation of contracts began at IES, but is expected to extend to other parts of the department. A department spokeswoman, Madi Biedermann, said earlier this week that 89 contracts worth nearly $900 million had been canceled at IES \u2014 not counting the new crop canceled on Friday.\nOther officials said the total number was 167 or 169. It\u2019s not clear what accounted for the discrepancy. IES has a small full-time staff; most of its work is<b> </b>contracted out.\nIt\u2019s also not clear<b> </b>whether the savings are as deep as the<b> </b>department said.\nNat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, pulled data on the canceled contracts that suggested DOGE overstated the cost of some of them. He also found that, in many cases, contractors are already several years into their agreements, so a lot of the money has been spent already. His preliminary calculations show that the actual savings may be half as much as DOGE claims, or less.\nMalkus\u2019s concern is that agreements were canceled without careful consideration, and for less of a benefit than advertised.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bloat in IES. There\u2019s a lot of problems to be solved,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are problems you solve with a scalpel and maybe a hatchet, but not a bulldozer.\u201d\n\u2018Complete confusion\u2019\nThe \u201cbulldozer\u201d arrived at IES on Monday, when a young representative of DOGE delivered the list of contracts to be terminated to the department\u2019s acting director. Soon after, a flurry of emergency meetings began, first with managers and then with rank-and-file employees, announcing that the contracts were being canceled, effective immediately.\nThere were no reasons given for the cuts, attendees said, except that DOGE wanted them. The mood was somber, with some holding back tears, staffers said. Confused IES employees asked repeatedly about the legality of DOGE\u2019s actions, but they didn\u2019t get an answer.\nMeantime, on the outside, texts, emails and calls were bouncing among researchers and contractors as word spread of canceled contracts. The feeling was utter shock and \u201ccomplete confusion,\u201d said Rachel Dinkes, president and CEO of Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education research groups.\nInside and outside the department, those close to IES research said they<b> </b>were unsettled by the youth and inexperience of DOGE representatives recommending the cancellations, as well as what seemed to be a lack of understanding of the complex, interdependent ecosystem of contracts maintained by IES.\nFor instance, one canceled contract was for work on the Common Core of Data, the primary database of all K-12 schools in the United States. It includes data on enrollment, demographics and other information about students and teachers, and is used by researchers, government agencies and others for a wide range of reasons. It is, said Dinkes, the \u201cbackbone\u201d of knowledge about American education and needed for virtually any effort to compare and analyze schools.\nContracts for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/01/29/nations-report-card-naep-test-scores-fall/\">National Assessment of Educational Progress</a>, or NAEP, exams were not canceled. But Dinkes and others said that NAEP relies on the Common Core of Data when it creates the sample<b> </b>of schools to administer tests. So running the testing program, sometimes called the Nation\u2019s Report Card, will be harder without the Common Core of Data, she said.\nIn another example, DOGE killed a contract for interpreting data IES collects from colleges and universities tracking enrollment and financial aid. The raw data will still be gathered, but the studies that made sense of it for the public are gone. That will make it harder to understand how students are using financial aid, staffers said, and to identify barriers to higher education.\n\u201cSure, you have the raw data that scientists can fiddle with, but the necessary step of digesting that in ways that answer questions, it\u2019s gone,\u201d a staffer said. \u201cNow you need a PhD to make any sense of it.\u201d\nDOGE also canceled contracts IES maintained to publish practice guides for students and schools on topics including how to prepare for college, how to succeed in high school, how to become literate in STEM \u2014 and, for educators, how to solve attendance problems. The guides were the most popular product IES publishes, staffers said.\n\nIn other cases, contracts were for programs that are designed to test the most effective way to solve a problem within the education system. For instance, one contractor was running a study looking at how best to accelerate math learning, Dinkes said. She said the study involved giving half of a group of students<b> </b>one type of instruction and the other half another. The goal was to see which teaching method produced better math results.\nBut the experiment was abruptly terminated this week when the contract was canceled, she said, and the students are no longer getting either of the math interventions.\nBefore the cuts, some employees tried to lay out these complexities for DOGE representatives, a staffer said. Some contracts were expendable, they suggested, but others were not. But the employees were unable to sway DOGE team.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve effectively dismantled us,\u201d said one staffer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re completely crippled,\u201d said another.\nIn addition, many of the canceled contracts were nearing the end of multiyear projects, so terminating them meant time, effort and money already expended may go to waste.\n\u201cCanceling them now yields the taxpayers no return on their investment,\u201d said a statement from American Institutes for Research, which had 15 IES contracts worth more than $180 million, according to DOGE\u2019s list, which was obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cThis is an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\nBiedermann, the department spokeswoman, said the contracts were costing more than they were worth. But she said she didn\u2019t know<b> </b>how or why DOGE reached that conclusion. \u201cThe significant amount of money as compared to the outcomes generated for students is not commensurate,\u201d she said.\nAsked how DOGE workers have the requisite expertise to make these determinations, she said, \u201cThe entire goal of DOGE is to cut waste, and they have been trained to identify that.\u201d\nContracts that can be justified or that are congressionally mandated will be rebid, which can be a lengthy process, officials said.\nThe cancellations hung over the confirmation hearing Thursday for Linda McMahon, Trump\u2019s nominee for Education secretary, with several Democrat senators pressing her on what was going on inside the agency.\nSen. Edward J. Markey (D-Massachusetts) said DOGE rightfully stands for the \u201cDepartment of Gutting Education.\u201d\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s just a down payment to gut the education of every public school student in America,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst they announce the cuts. Then they go to find where it is. So it\u2019s all backwards.\u201d\nGrants on the chopping block\nStaff at the Education Department<b> </b>are now bracing for the next round of cuts, they said, including more grant cancellations.\nMost of the money that Education sends to schools is distributed by a formula, but more than $7 billion is given through competitive grant programs, such as one that pays for after school programs and another that supports charter schools.\nLast week, staffers were directed to review all grants that have \u201cillegal DEI in them,\u201d another employee said. On Monday, a DOGE account on X <a href=\"https://x.com/DOGE/status/1889105335991820585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1889105335991820585%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc\">said</a> that it had terminated 29 \u201cDEI training grants\u201d at the Education Department totaling $101 million.\nAlso on Monday, DOGE was given access to scour a database detailing all the department\u2019s grants, said one person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private proceedings. \u201cGrants will be [canceled] this week or early next,\u201d the person predicted.\nThen, on Friday, the department announced it was terminating $33 million in grants for Equity Assistance Centers, a program created to support school desegregation but that the department said supports \u201cdivisive training.\u201d\nThe DOGE team has also gained access to sensitive department data, including the personal information of millions of borrowers who\u2019ve taken out federal student loans. That\u2019s led to a 30-fold increase in complaints<b> </b>to a privacy office at the department, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nDuncan, the former education secretary, said DOGE workers have no qualifications and no legal right to access Americans\u2019 personal data. More important, he said, they have the wrong goals.\n\u201cAll this sound and noise and drama and not one word about helping more kids learn to read,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even a mention.\u201d"

        "content": "A federal judge on Friday denied a request to temporarily ban employees working with the U.S. DOGE Service from accessing closely guarded systems inside the federal government that contain tax returns, Social Security numbers and reams of private data for millions of Americans.<b> </b>But another federal court\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/\" target=_blank>temporary ban remains in place for now</a>.\nThe lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Virginia by the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center and an anonymous federal worker is one of several seeking to block DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency, from getting ahold of records kept by the Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which processes about $6 trillion a year in electronic payments to households, businesses and other recipients \u2014 and keeps vast stores of data on \u201cvirtually every single person in the country,\u201d according to the plaintiffs.\nAttorneys also asked the judge to block DOGE from accessing records maintained by the U.S.<b> </b>Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which detail the Social Security numbers, birth dates, salaries, home addresses and disciplinary histories of all federal workers and personal information for millions of applicants seeking government jobs. DOGE\u2019s flurry of moves in the first month of the new presidential administration have sparked dozens of lawsuits across the country.\nIn a written opinion Friday, U.S. District Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr. said the nonprofit and the federal worker seeking a preliminary injunction had \u201cnot provided concrete evidence that Defendants are actively misusing or even attempting to misuse their sensitive data.\u201d\nA federal court in Manhattan already had imposed a temporary ban on DOGE access to Americans\u2019 private data held by the Treasury, and other requests for temporary bans are pending before a federal judge in D.C. Alston was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term.\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 fears of future harm are much too speculative and would require the Court to make several leaps in reasoning in order to warrant injunctive relief,\u201d Alston wrote.\nJohn L. Davisson, director of litigation for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said at a hearing Friday that exposing millions of Americans\u2019 private financial data in a \u201chistorically large and consequential breach\u201d violated several federal laws and the Fifth Amendment, and could leave the United States more vulnerable to malign actors.\nIn one of his first executive orders last month, Trump charged DOGE and its de facto leader, billionaire Elon Musk, with modernizing government agencies and reviewing their functions. Justice Department attorneys said in a legal filing that the groups suing over DOGE\u2019s moves were \u201cseeking unprecedented judicial micromanagement of the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to share government data with its own employees.\u201d\nJonathan Lucier, an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, said at a court hearing Friday that the employees in question were all hired by Treasury and OPM or detailed to those agencies. Granting data access to in-house employees carrying out a presidential initiative \u201ccannot be illegal,\u201d Lucier argued.\nTom Krause, a tech company chief executive who briefly worked for DOGE, is now a senior Treasury adviser and the only liaison to the group. Justice Department attorneys said in court papers that he has never been given \u201cdirect access\u201d to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service payment system, only \u201cover-the-shoulder\u201d access \u201cto review activity others performed in the system or data others accessed from the system.\u201d\nBut Justice Department attorneys acknowledged in a footnote that another employee who began working at DOGE and was then hired by Treasury, Marko Elez, did have access to the closely guarded payment system \u2014 which includes details of highly classified programs \u2014 until he resigned Feb. 6. He was found to have made racist statements on social media. Musk said he would rehire Elez, who now works at the Social Security Administration, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/doge-staffer-behind-racist-posts-reappears-at-social-security?embedded-checkout=true\" target=_blank>according to Bloomberg News</a>.\nIn response to a lawsuit filed by 19 states, another federal court barred Krause from accessing Americans\u2019 personal or financial information pending further legal proceedings. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in Manhattan found that the states would face irreparable harm without the temporary ban \u201cbecause of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.\u201d\nAnother federal judge in Manhattan <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/\" target=_blank>issued a preliminary injunction</a> in that case Friday, prohibiting DOGE from accessing the Treasury data while the states\u2019 lawsuit is pending. U.S. District Judge Jeannette A. Vargas said she could lift the ban if the Trump administration can show it is taking steps to safeguard the public\u2019s most sensitive data."

        "content": "A federal judge on Thursday extended for seven days <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/07/federal-judge-blocks-trump-administration-putting-thousands-usaid-workers-leave/\" target=\"_blank\">his temporary restraining order</a> on the Trump administration\u2019s move to place about 2,100 employees from the U.S. Agency for International Development on paid leave, delaying any action while the judge weighs whether to order a longer pause.\nTwo labor unions representing USAID employees sued the Trump administration last week, saying the sudden halt to funding not only upended overseas aid programs but endangered some employees\u2019 lives in various countries. U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, a Trump appointee, first entered a restraining order last week stopping the plan.\nOn Thursday, he told Justice Department employees to submit to him by Friday the steps it was taking to ensure overseas employees\u2019 safety and to indicate whether it would cover employees\u2019 other benefits, such as school or car payments, while they are on leave.\nNichols had set his original restraining order to expire at 11:59 p.m. Friday. He extended all the deadlines in the order by one week, while he drafts an opinion on whether to enjoin the spending shutdowns throughout the litigation. He amended the order to ban involuntary evacuations of USAID workers overseas, but not voluntary ones.\nLawyers on both sides were not fully clear last week how many USAID workers were affected. The government said in an affidavit that 2,140 employees had been placed on paid leave as of Feb. 7, replacing the 2,700 figure used in last week\u2019s hearing. The government said 98 percent of those placed on leave were stationed in the United States. The unions said Thursday USAID employs about 4,700 people, and about 1,400 live abroad.\nThe Trump administration has argued that it was merely pausing USAID spending while it examines whether the agency is pursuing Trump\u2019s agenda, and that some top aides were ousted for refusing directions to immediately stop funding. The employees\u2019 union said the pause has already damaged aid programs around the world and possibly placed employees in danger by not paying for their cellphones, internet or other security measures.\nThe suit marks the first major legal challenge to the push by President Donald Trump and his allies, led by billionaire Elon Musk and his U.S. DOGE Service, or Department of Government Efficiency, targeting foreign aid programs and USAID staff as part of their campaign<b> </b>to reshape the federal government. The lawsuit is one of several <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/06/trump-resistance-courts-democrats-musk/\" target=_blank>legal challenges mounted by Trump opponents</a> seeking to<b> </b>slow or halt the administration\u2019s barrage of actions to curtail spending, pare back the administrative state, eradicate diversity initiatives and more.\nThe judge\u2019s extension comes as the Trump administration grows increasingly defensive of the chaos caused by the halt in aid projects around the world.\nOn Thursday, the Trump administration sent an internal memo to USAID employees threatening to fire them if they communicated with the press about continued disruptions to foreign aid despite Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s issuing an exemption for \u201clifesaving humanitarian assistance\u201d last month.\n\u201c\ufeffThe purpose of this memo is to correct a false narrative in the press, and provide clarity for staff on external communications,\u201d wrote USAID official Mark Lloyd to staff in a memo obtained by The Washington Post.\nRubio\u2019s exemption \u201chas continued uninterrupted and was never paused,\u201d Lloyd added. \u201cUnauthorized engagement externally with the press or others is subject to discipline, including dismissal.\u201d\nLeading aid groups say even when they\u2019ve obtained exemptions, they cannot continue their work because Rubio\u2019s \u201cstop work\u201d order has effectively shut down payment systems required to draw down funds. That has resulted in thousands of aid workers and USAID contractors being furloughed, disrupting projects from Asia to Africa to Latin America.\nUSAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.\nIn another move this week, the White House fired the inspector general for USAID on Tuesday after he released a blistering report saying $489 million in food assistance was at risk of spoilage or potential diversion because of the funding freeze and work stoppage.\nThe Trump administration is \u201cengaged in a wholesale and rapid campaign to dissolve the USAID in its entirety,\u201d said attorney Karla Gilbride, representing both the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees. \u201cThat campaign has begun with the freezing of all funding on USAID projects.\u201d\nNichols immediately interjected, saying, \u201cAs I understand it, all funding on all projects is not frozen.\u201d\nGilbride said the government\u2019s claims do \u201cnot match the reality on the ground,\u201d in which bills are not being paid and employees are operating in an information vacuum as USAID leadership in Washington is upended. \u201cIt is not consistent with the declaration that this is just a \u2018pencils down\u2019 pause. Which is what a 90-day review suggested.\u201d\nThe unions have argued that USAID is a body created by Congress, and a law passed last year requires the president to notify and consult Congress if it intends to \u201creorganize or redesign, eliminate, consolidate or downsize any agency,\u201d Gilbride said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary that the court impose the injunction and extend the temporary order so that the situation doesn\u2019t get worse,\u201d Gilbride said.\nWith a preliminary injunction, Nichols would not be making a final judgment on whether the USAID moves are legal. For now, he must decide whether irreparable harm will be caused if he doesn\u2019t issue the injunction while also considering the likelihood of whether the employees will prevail on the larger question.\nNichols seemed particularly concerned by a \u201cclearly harrowing situation\u201d in Democratic Republic of Congo, where USAID staff in Kinshasa had to evacuate due to civil unrest there but couldn\u2019t obtain any funds from Washington to do so, and wound up crossing the Congo River in small boats, leaving their homes and belongings behind.\nJustice Department attorney Eric Hamilton said the Trump administration was \u201ccommitted to every USAID employee\u2019s security, and everyone will be kept safe.\u201d\nHamilton said the Justice Department believes Trump acted within his authority under Article II of the Constitution, and \u201cEight foreign aid statutes recognize the need for presidential direction in this space. We think it\u2019s consistent with all of those authorities, that the president when he comes into office, on the first day to take brief stock to see that foreign aid is only let out consistent with his policy.\u201d\nHamilton added: \u201cWe don\u2019t think a reorganization has happened. It\u2019s a 90-day pause.\u201d But he noted Rubio did send a letter to Congress on Feb. 3 notifying them of the move.\n\u201cThat notice checks the box,\u201d Hamilton said of the requirement for the president to consult with Congress before remaking an agency. \u201cWe think the specifics of that consultation would be a political question.\u201d\nNichols raised the issue of whether the employees\u2019 complaints of mistreatment should be heard by a civil service board, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board, rather than a court. Harrison agreed. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s changing is whether they\u2019re doing work and having access to systems,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThis makes this very much a personnel dispute, not appropriate for federal district court.\u201d\nGilbride responded that going through civil service appeals can \u201ctake years to reach a conclusion. By the time the MSPB process goes through, many years may have passed and there will no longer be a USAID for individuals to return to. \u2026 The unions that are in this case are not seeking damages or back pay on behalf of their members. What they\u2019re seeking is that USAID not be unconstitutionally dissolved.\u201d\nThe extension comes as former U.S. officials who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations have become increasingly vocal about the ramifications of USAID\u2019s dismantling.\nOn Wednesday, more than 200 former officials wrote a letter to leaders of the House and Senate saying \u201cthe human suffering that these cutoffs have caused is catastrophic and heartbreaking.\u201d\n\u201cIn Kenya, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere, aid to survivors of torture was stopped in its tracks,\u201d said the officials, who include Michael Hayden, who headed the National Security Agency during the Bush administration; former CIA officer Bruce Riedel; former Middle East adviser Aaron David Miller; former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch; and others.\n\u201cChildren and adult victims of war and terror who have relied on the United States have been left without care. And in poorer countries around the world, thousands of women and girls will die in the next 90 days due to complications of childbirth that might otherwise have been avoided through interventions funded by Congress and administered by USAID,\u201d they wrote in the letter, obtained by The Post."

The third order seeks to combat antisemitism in schools.\nFor years, Republicans including President Donald Trump have attacked schools for teaching a basket of ideas about systemic racism labeled critical race theory. Trump has also attacked schools for policies and lessons that recognize and respect transgender students.\nFederal law allows the agency to withhold federal funds from any school that discriminates based on race. Trump and his allies argue that lessons about systemic racism amount to discrimination, because they presume certain things about people based on race, such as that White Americans enjoy certain privileges based on their race.

It\u2019s a hot mess,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), who has discussed plans with regional leaders including Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, whom Blumenthal met in the Jordanian Red Sea resort of Aqaba this week.\n\u201cThe Arab plan will seek to present a realistic proposal for reconstruction in Gaza without forced evacuation and without a United States takeover,\u201d Blumenthal said in a telephone interview.\nThe broad strokes of the Arab plan \u2014 hoped to be<b> </b>finalized ahead of an emergency summit with representatives of the broader 22-member Arab League on March 4 \u2014 are \u201cbecoming clearer,\u201d Blumenthal said. But significant hurdles remain, including reaching Arab consensus and<b> </b>obtaining U.S. and Israeli buy-in, he added.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel is \u201ccommitted\u201d to Trump\u2019s plan and described it as a \u201cbold vision\u201d for Gaza. The proposal has also received rapturous approval from the country\u2019s far-right politicians, who have pushed for Israeli settlements in Gaza and the enclave\u2019s annexation.\nBut Arab states are hoping to garner backing for their plan with their checkbooks. A new assessment by the United Nations estimates that it could cost $50 billion to rebuild Gaza after the devastation caused by 15 months of war.\nThe exact figure to be put forward is \u201cstill up for review,\u201d but the proposal is likely to include a headline number, said Emirati academic Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a visiting fellow at Harvard University.\n\u201cThe number is important because they know the president of the United States is transactional, he likes numbers, and they think he might be swayed when he sees these billions of dollars,\u201d including construction opportunities for U.S. companies,<b> </b>he said.\nEgyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said this week that regional construction firms, including those in Egypt, have the capacity to build 300,000 housing units over a three-year period.\nOther proposals being considered appear aimed at keeping Trump\u2019s interest in investment at the heart of Gaza\u2019s future. One, from the Al Habtoor Group, an Emirati conglomerate, <a href=\"https://www.alhabtoorgroup.com/gaza/Gaza-Reconstruction-Plan.pdf\" target=_blank>outlines a phased approach</a> that would establish security in the territory and transition emergency housing into redevelopment over 18 months.\nArab countries know they hold leverage by being \u201cthe ATMs\u201d for reconstruction, said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. However, the \u201cclash of worldviews,\u201d between Israel and Trump on one side and the region on the other, remains a major sticking point, he said.\nDuring his trip to Washington this month, Netanyahu looked on smiling as Trump outlined his plans for a U.S. \u201ctakeover\u201d of Gaza. \u201cThe big impediment is if the whole exercise will be accepted by Trump, and certainly big questions over whether it will be accepted by the current Israeli government,\u201d Katulis said of the Arab plan.\nPhase one of the Arab plan envisages reconstruction in areas that have not been completely obliterated, but Arab leaders are willing to open their wallets only if other political and security elements of a plan are put in place, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who has recently met with ministers from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan to discuss evolving plans. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balancing act because all these three pieces need to converge,\u201d he said.\nThe technocratic committee envisioned for Gaza under the Arab plan would not include Hamas, the ruler of Gaza for almost two decades and architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\u201cThe two main driving principles on the governance side is that Hamas will have no governing role in Gaza, and also that it creates a political unity with the West Bank,\u201d said Van Hollen, adding that Arab states want the Palestinian Authority, the governing entity in the West Bank, to have some degree of sign-off on the structure.\nArab leaders, like previous U.S. administrations, have long advocated a clear path to a two-state solution, which Netanyahu has repeatedly opposed, along with any rule by the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.\n\u201cSquaring that circle is a big challenge at this point,\u201d Van Hollen said.\nTwo officials briefed on the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive proposals that are still in flux, emphasized that the technocratic government is intended to be a \u201ctemporary\u201d body to oversee rebuilding and would remain in place only until elections could be held.\nWhile many officials in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, and in Riyadh remain frustrated that they were not informed before Trump floated the Gaza displacement plan, they also acknowledge that the U.S. leader\u2019s approach has succeeded in motivating the Arab states to act, according to the officials.\n\u201cTrump scrambled the table, and it forced other people to start doing some of the heavy lifting,\u201d said one individual familiar with the thinking of the regional leadership. Others in the region draw parallels to Trump\u2019s comments on Ukraine that spurred emergency meetings of leaders in Europe.\nBut Van Hollen said he also fears that Trump\u2019s plan has set back the chances of making a deal. \u201cIn addition to being outrageous on its face, it\u2019s further emboldened the far right and made it more difficult to achieve an overall settlement,\u201d he said.\nHamas\u2019s objections are another potential spoiler to any plan, as is the thorny question of who will provide security in Gaza. Hamas still holds weapons stockpiles, while the security vacuum has led to a rise in criminal gangs.\n\u201cThere is still a very challenging and complicated road ahead, even if Arab leaders present a realistic plan,\u201d said Blumenthal, adding that Abdullah has been \u201cvery clear-eyed and realistic\u201d in his thinking.\nBut while the gaps remain wide, both Trump and Netanyahu want a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and also to maintain a regional coalition against Iran as Israel mulls <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/12/israel-iran-us-intelligence/\" target=_blank>strikes against Tehran\u2019s nuclear program</a>.\n\u201cThere is a golden opportunity for Israel to integrate with the region and recognize its wildest dreams,\u201d said Katulis.\nWhile Trump\u2019s initial proposal to empty Gaza of its inhabitants sparked anger in Saudi Arabia, the close ties between the two powers were on full display this week.\nTrump made an appearance at a Saudi investment summit in Miami after tapping Riyadh to host talks to end the war in Ukraine. The coverage in Saudi media was glowing. Saudi Arabia \u201chas achieved success on all fronts,\u201d proclaimed a column in Asharq al-Awsat by Tariq Alhomayed, the newspaper\u2019s former editor.\nSpeaking at the summit in Miami on Thursday, Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, addressed Gaza and appeared to dial back elements of the president\u2019s plan that had caused alarm, saying some of Trump\u2019s comments had been misconstrued.\nThe level of destruction is so great, a five-year development plan \u201cis not physically possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we are on an eviction plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means the president wants to shake up everybody\u2019s thinking.\u201d\nWitkoff said Arab leaders are now considering new solutions for rebuilding Gaza, ideas that \u201cpeople would have never considered, and I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n<i>Abigail Hauslohner in Washington contributed to this report.</i>"

It would be an especially extraordinary step for the typically cautious FAA, whose systems are vital to the safety of millions of air travelers every day.\nThe existing contract was awarded to Verizon in 2023, with the aim of upgrading a platform that different air traffic control facilities and FAA offices use to communicate with one another.\nMusk has personally taken aim at Verizon on his social media platform X in recent days, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1894202642639061144\" target=_blank>saying on Monday</a>: \u201cThe Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.\u201d\nVerizon did not respond to a request for comment. Joseph Russo, a Verizon executive vice president, said at an event hosted by Barclays Bank on Tuesday that Starlink\u2019s efforts at FAA might be complementary to Verizon\u2019s. Verizon was offering the \u201creliability and performance\u201d that the FAA needed, and its system was expected to be operational soon, Russo said.\nThe FAA said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cno decisions have been made\u201d about the Verizon project.\nA team of employees from SpaceX, Starlink\u2019s parent company, has been working inside the FAA in recent days, charged by the Trump administration with helping modernize the agency\u2019s aging technology. Ted Malaska, one of them, shared a<a href=\"https://x.com/TedMalaska/status/1892705202576277926\" target=_blank> picture on X on Thursday</a> saying he was excited to be working with the FAA, and thanking Musk and Trump for their \u201cvision and focus on safety.\u201d\n\u201cI challenge anyone to question the honesty and my technical integrity on this matter,\u201d Malaska <a href=\"https://x.com/TedMalaska/status/1894787084663300535\" target=_blank>posted Wednesday</a>. \u201cI am working without biases for the safety of people that fly.\u201d\nSeveral of the SpaceX employees now have FAA email addresses, according to two people who have seen the addresses, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. FAA regulates SpaceX and has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/17/faa-spacex-fine-elon-musk-regulation/\" target=_blank>alleged</a> that the company has violated safety rules relating to its rocket launches.\nIn a statement Monday, the FAA said it was testing Starlink systems at facilities in New Jersey and Alaska, in hopes of providing more reliable connectivity in remote locations. Elements of the FAA\u2019s deliberations were previously reported by the Associated Press and Bloomberg News.\nTransportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369262913112\" target=_blank>on Fox News this week</a> that the government had been too slow to modernize its technology and that the new administration was ready to move quickly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at a year, year-and-a-half time frame and do massive upgrades, improve the systems, help air traffic controllers, keep our skies safer,\u201d Duffy said.\nBut the Starlink plan adds to Musk\u2019s existing conflicts of interest at the FAA relating to SpaceX, according to John P. Pelissero, the director of an ethics center at Santa Clara University.\nPelissero said it appears that \u201cbecause of Musk\u2019s current position in DOGE and his closeness to Trump he and his company are getting an advantage and getting a contract.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s looking out for the public interest here when you get the person who\u2019s cutting budgets and personnel from the FAA, suddenly trying to benefit from still another government contract?\u201d Pelissero said.\nThe Transportation Department, DOGE and SpaceX did not respond to questions on how the process of changing contractors has been handled and whether potential conflicts of interest have been reviewed. Trump has said Musk will not be permitted to participate in decisions that pose a conflict of interest.\nVerizon was tapped in 2023 to build a system called the FAA Enterprise Network Services Program or FENS, replacing a system that dates to 2002. The contract had a 15-year lifespan, and the system is intended to connect some 4,600 sites, according to the FAA.\nThe agency was scheduled to make a final decision on whether<b> </b>to start paying Verizon for the contract next month, said one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\nInstead, Musk\u2019s team determined the job should go to Starlink, the person said. But the process for unwinding a contract and awarding it to another company is lengthy and has not been followed in this case so far, the person said.\nSeveral senior FAA officials have refused to sign paperwork authorizing the switch,<b> </b>according to the person, who has been briefed on the internal deliberations and resulting fallout, so Musk\u2019s team is now seeking help from the acting administrator of the agency, Trump appointee Chris Rocheleau, and Duffy.\nOutside reviews of the FAA\u2019s technology have repeatedly concluded in recent years that it is woefully out of date and that the agency is too slow to make upgrades. A 2023 <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/NAS_safety_review_team_report.pdf\" target=_blank>safety review pointed to technological problems</a> as one factor that was creating \u201crisk\u201d in the aviation system, a problem the Verizon contract is supposed to help solve.\nJessica Tillipman, the associate dean for government and procurement law studies at George Washington University School of Law, said terminating a contract can be expensive, time consuming and could lead to litigation.\n\u201cWhen the government terminates a contract it\u2019s not like it shuts off the spigot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive to wind down a contract. It\u2019s very expensive and it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\nShe said negotiating a settlement can take a year.\nIn awarding a new contract, agencies must comply with the Competition and Contracting Act, which requires competition in government procurements. It does have some exceptions. Among those: national security, public interest or urgency, she said.\n\u201cBut the question is, how is it so urgent when you already had a contractor dealing with it?,\u201d said Tillipman, adding that there are many different guardrails within the federal acquisition system to make sure things are fair, transparent and efficient.\n\u201cHowever, in the last few weeks she said many of these guardrails have been tested, which will likely lead to litigation,\u201d she said.\n<i>Washington Post researcher Aaron Schaffer contributed to this report.</i>"

        "headline": "Trump moves to narrow independence of Fed, along with other Wall Street overseers",
        "content": "The Trump administration took another swing at the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence late Tuesday with a new executive order that seeks more control over federal agencies that have traditionally operated with day-to-day autonomy.\nEven as the White House executive order said it would protect the Fed\u2019s monetary policy \u2014 including its powers to set interest rates \u2014 it sought to scoop up all of Wall Street\u2019s biggest regulators and make their budgets subject to the authority of the White House budget office.\nIt\u2019s just the latest political attack on the Fed, a 111-year institution responsible for setting short-term borrowing costs that trickle through the financial sector and influence what millions of consumers and businesses pay to borrow money. It also plays a key role supervising and regulating Wall Street.\nIt\u2019s possible little of Tuesday\u2019s order will ultimately apply to the Fed because Congress established the central bank to operate with significant independence in determining how to use its resources. The order notes it does not seek to \u201cimpair\u201d any authorities Congress has given to independent agencies.\n\u201cTime, the courts and Congress will ultimately determine whether and how much of this sticks,\u201d said Scott Alvarez, a former general counsel at the Fed. \u201cWhat\u2019s important at this point is the President has announced he wants to dismantle a system of independent agencies that Congress has established and the courts have upheld and wants to shift funding decisions from Congress and the appropriations process to himself.\u201d\nLaws and norms have traditionally protected the Fed from the executive branch, with the aim of demonstrating to global markets that U.S. monetary policy isn\u2019t at the mercy of the political whims of the White House. But President Donald Trump has made clear he thinks he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/23/trump-federal-reserve/\" target=_blank>should get more of a say</a>.\nThe Fed declined to comment. A White House spokesman had no immediate comment.\nFor their part, Fed officials of their own volition have already made a series of decisions in the first weeks of the Trump administration to align internal policies with lawful directives from the White House, with the aim of avoiding a dispute with the administration, Fed watchers say.\nAlmost immediately after Trump was sworn into office, Fed officials announced a suspension of \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d programs, as well as a systemwide hiring freeze, according to emails reviewed by The Washington Post. The Fed is also trying to align to Trump\u2019s return-to-office policies, with officials considering reductions to remote work.\n\u201cAs has been our practice over many administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,\u201d Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell told reporters earlier this month.\nThe difference in the move on Tuesday is that the White House appears to be trying to force the changes on the Fed when it comes to its oversight and regulation of Wall Street. The order requires that independent agencies submit major regulations to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review.\nThe new order also states that only the president and the attorney general \u2014 \u201csubject to the President\u2019s supervision and control\u201d \u2014 will interpret law on behalf of the executive branch, blocking independent federal agencies from adopting legal interpretations that are at odds with the Trump White House.\nOMB is run by Russell Vought, a fiscal hawk who helped to craft Project 2025, a controversial policy blueprint that has informed Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Specifically, Project 2025 suggests the Fed\u2019s role should be narrowed to only keeping the money supply stable, <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-24.pdf\" target=_blank>not regulating Wall Street banks or acting as a lender of last resort when big banks fail</a>, because \u201cpolitical pressure has led the Federal Reserve to use its power to regulate banks as a way to promote politically favorable initiatives,\u201d the paper said.\nFed watchers say the central bank\u2019s actions to date suggest it wants to choose its battles carefully, avoiding conflicts with Trump that don\u2019t directly threaten its control over monetary policy. The Fed has fiercely protected its independence since the high-inflation era of the 1970s. That period was partly driven by the central bank\u2019s own missteps under pressure from President Richard M. Nixon to keep rates low, despite signs that the economy was overheating, to help his reelection campaign.\n\u201cThe Fed is willing to go all 15 rounds with the sitting president to preserve its ability to make interest-rate policy separate from the Oval Office,\u201d said Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt is not willing to separate itself from the Oval Office on nearly anything else.\u201d\n\u201cThe White House \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 appears to insist on precisely this balance of power,\u201d he added. \u201cThe question only remains whether President Trump and those closest to him will continue to regard even monetary policy as outside of his immediate control.\u201d\nFor months, Trump officials have privately discussed ways to streamline the alphabet soup of agencies responsible for overseeing Wall Street. One approach envisions consolidating agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency into a single entity, according to people familiar with the discussions granted anonymity to convey internal plans.\nLacking sufficient votes in the Senate to overhaul the financial regulatory system, the White House\u2019s order could provide a backup approach to trying to consolidate at least some control of financial regulation, even if it remains unlikely the Fed\u2019s regulatory functions wind up under the direct purview of the president. The Fed, the FDIC and the comptroller are the three primary federal banking regulators.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Fed has moved quickly to align its policies with those of a new administration. At the start of Trump\u2019s first term, the central bank similarly adopted a hiring freeze ordered across the government by the president.\nThis time, the political environment is more hostile to the Fed. During Trump\u2019s first term, some Republican senators backed Powell against repeated efforts by Trump to undermine the independence of the Fed. Most of those lawmakers are no longer in office.\nThe push for more say over the Fed comes after Michael Barr, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for banking supervision, last month said he would step down from the role at the end of this month, avoiding a potential legal fight over whether Trump had the authority to demote him.\nThe Fed\u2019s move to comply with earlier orders from the White House has been evident in the way it immediately removed public-facing webpages highlighting the board\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts following a directive from Trump that agencies cease such work.\nThe shift is notable at some regional Fed banks. At the New York Fed, officials canceled a reception scheduled for Thursday and also withdrew from a summer fellowship program that aimed to support women and underrepresented groups in economics, according to a social media post from Yana van der Meulen Rodgers, an economist at Rutgers University. A bank official attributed the cancellations to the suspension of DEI work, according to an email reviewed by The Post.\nThe New York Fed declined to comment.\nAt the Kansas City Fed, top officials told staff members on Halloween \u2014 less than a week before the presidential election \u2014 that the bank\u2019s commitment to DEI \u201cremains steadfast,\u201d according to a message to the bank\u2019s roughly 2,000 employees reviewed by The Post.\nThat contrasted sharply with a Jan. 28 message from the top two officials at each Fed bank announcing the system was \u201ctemporarily pausing\u201d diversity initiatives through at least February.\n<i>Jeff Stein contributed to this report.</i>"

        "headline": "Trump, Modi aim to cut U.S. trade gap with India amid global tariff concerns",
        "content": "The United States and India are working toward a deal that aims to cut America\u2019s sizable trade gap with India as New Delhi pledges to buy more U.S. energy, weapons and civil nuclear power, President Donald Trump said Thursday during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Washington.\nThe meeting with Modi \u2014 the fourth foreign leader to visit Trump in the White House since his inauguration \u2014 was one of the earliest measures of how Trump will handle his relationship with New Delhi. The partnership is a pillar of Washington\u2019s strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, but one that is beset with trouble spots on illegal immigration, visas, America\u2019s large trade deficit with India and controversies over India\u2019s attempted assassination of a Sikh activist on American soil.\nDuring the news conference, Trump sought to emphasize the friendship between Washington and New Delhi, even as he announced shortly before it that the United States would implement a \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff policy that would tax foreign goods at the same rate that other nations apply to American products, potentially complicating talks with India.\nTrump said the United States will increase military sales to India by \u201cmany billions of dollars\u201d and would consider providing New Delhi F-35 fighter jets. He reiterated his dismay with India\u2019s tariffs toward the United States, but said the two countries will negotiate a trade deal that will ensure a \u201clevel playing field.\u201d Trump said India will reform its laws to welcome U.S. nuclear technology into its domestic market.\nOn the issue of immigration \u2014 which sparked outrage in India after the Trump administration sent deportees back to the country in shackles on military fights \u2014 Modi said New Delhi will comply with Trump\u2019s desires. \u201cWe are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they have absolutely no right to be in that country,\u201d Modi said.\nIn one of the few moments the Indian prime minister spoke English, Modi became the latest leader trying to foster a personal relationship with Trump. The Indian leader borrowed from Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rhetoric to announce his own vision: Make India Great Again, or MIGA, he said in English, adding that the two countries could continue to help each other.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes \u2018mega\u2019 \u2014 a mega-partnership for prosperity,\u201d the Indian prime minister said, according to a translator.\nThe United States is India\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-india/\">largest</a> trading partner, buying more than 18 percent of all its exports. India exported $45 billion more to the United States than it imported, and Trump is keen to shrink that deficit. The lack of parity, as well as lingering frustration from a trade deal that never materialized during his first term, drove Trump to describe India on the campaign trail last year as a \u201cvery big abuser\u201d of tariffs.\nIn a call with Modi <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/readout-of-president-donald-j-trumps-call-with-prime-minister-modi-of-india/\">last month</a> \u2014 the second such conversation between the two leaders since the American election \u2014 Trump stressed the \u201cimportance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship,\u201d according to a White House readout.\nModi visited Washington <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/indias-modi-meet-trump-with-planned-tariff-concessions-2025-02-10/\">armed</a> with concessions aimed at averting a trade war and staving off damaging tariffs on the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. The concessions include a commitment to significantly boost purchases of American energy. New Delhi has already reduced tariffs on high-end American motorcycles \u2014 a fixation for Trump, who repeatedly called the 100 percent duty on Harley-Davidsons \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nIndia signaled it was open to offering tariff concessions for imports from the United States in several sectors, including electronics, medical equipment and chemicals, an analyst familiar with the matter said. The Modi administration is looking at potential deals on U.S. agriculture exports and nuclear energy investments, the analyst added, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Reuters earlier reported the possible concessions.\nAhead of his meeting with Trump, Modi on Thursday met with the president\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz. He also held meetings with billionaire Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, according to Indian officials. On Wednesday, he held talks with Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard.\nDuring the news conference Thursday evening, the two leaders said a key path to shrinking America\u2019s trade gap with India involves selling billions of dollars worth of energy, especially liquid natural gas, to India. The Biden administration had paused liquid natural gas project approvals as part of its effort to curb climate change. While the leaders were speaking, Waltz posted on X: \u201cDrill Baby Drill = Buy Baby Buy.\u201d\nModi said that India and the United States will collaborate on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum technology. Trump said the United States would also extradite one of the plotters of the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai.\nAlso, Modi announced that India was moving to change its liability laws to enable U.S. civil nuclear energy firms to sell reactors there. The law currently puts liability on the supplier, not the operator.\nSuch a move would be \u201ca long-sought win for the Trump administration,\u201d said Lindsey Ford, White House director for South Asia in the Biden administration. \u201cBut Modi\u2019s decision to announce a similar agreement with France one day prior is a reminder for the United States that U.S. technology will not be the only game in town.\u201d\nA sign of the growing confidence between the two governments was Trump\u2019s statement that his administration was open to considering selling the vaunted F-35 stealth fighter jet to India, a weapons platform the United States makes available to only its closest and most trusted allies and partners.\nBut the weapon is costly and India would need to \u201cdramatically overhaul and upgrade its industrial security procedures to better protect against espionage and technology leakage,\u201d said Sameer Lalwani, a senior expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gesture of trust\u201d that Trump was even willing to contemplate that, he said. But the Indians are intent on building their own fighter jets, he said.\nThere would also be significant national security concerns with selling the fifth-generation fighter to India, which has recently fielded Russian S-400 air defense systems. Operating the two near one another enhances the risk that the Russian air defenses could acquire data that compromises the fighter\u2019s stealth signature, and could be used by Russia or China to better detect and target American F-35s, he said.\nThe trip also came in the wake of tensions around immigration. Last week, scenes of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/modi-trump-white-house-india-immigration-tariffs/\">dramatic deportation of more than 100 Indians</a>, who were sent back in shackles on a military jet, caused enormous embarrassment to Modi domestically. India is a major source of illegal immigration to the United States. As of 2022, it accounted for 725,000 out of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, according to the Pew Research Center.\nOver the Christmas holiday, far-right activists in Trump\u2019s base engaged in a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/27/h-1b-visas-elon-musk-trump-immigration/\">civil war</a>\u201d with Musk and other senior Trump allies over the need for a skilled-worker visa program that Silicon Valley has long relied on. Many Indians decried the backlash as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/07/india-maga-h1b-visa-america/\">racist</a>.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nModi said he did not discuss with Trump whether the American president would take action on the U.S. court case against Gautam Adani, an Indian billionaire and ally of the Indian prime minister accused of bribery schemes.\nTrump and Modi have forged a positive relationship since their first meeting in 2017, punctuated by reciprocal mass rallies \u2014 \u201cHowdy Modi\u201d in Houston in 2019 and \u201cNamaste Trump\u201d in Ahmedabad, India, in 2020. Their bond stems from a shared strategic interest in countering China as well as the cultivation of a strongman image.\nWashington has over the past 20 years grown closer to New Delhi, slowly diminishing India\u2019s decades-long dependence on Russian arms, for instance, though it has been buying large quantities of Russian oil.\nHeightened tensions with China after deadly border clashes in 2020 helped drive India closer to the United States, which has provided intelligence and equipment, including leased Predator drones, to help India defend its frontier.\nTrump in his first term revived a grouping known as \u201cthe Quad,\u201d consisting of India, Japan, the United States and Australia, widely seen as a counterweight to China\u2019s growing influence in the region. The Biden administration advanced the initiative, and analysts say that Trump may push the group in a more security-oriented direction.\nThe two countries established <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/01/31/india-us-tech-defense/\">a significant partnership</a> in emerging technology during the Biden administration, announcing for instance co-production plans for military jet engines and armored infantry vehicles.\nOne area that is likely to have a lower profile now is human rights, analysts said. The attempted assassination of the Sikh activist in 2023 caused tension between the two governments and led to murder-for-hire charges against an Indian intelligence official, who has since left the government.\nAdministration officials declined to comment on the matter on Thursday.\n\u201cI think now that issue is somewhat behind us,\u201d said Lisa Curtis, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a White House South Asia aide in Trump\u2019s first term.\nTrump also sought to flatter his Indian counterpart, grinning as he responded to a question about who won their negotiations.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a much tougher negotiator than me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a much better negotiator than me.\u201d\n<i>Anant Gupta and Karishma Mehrotra in New Delhi contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "The Justice Department is recruiting new attorneys to help defend President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration and other policies in court, according to public job postings, department officials and legal experts.\nThe aim is to create a cadre of lawyers with the skills and willingness to back the administration as it gears up for legal challenges on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/24/birthright-citizenship-democrats-lawsuits/\" target=_blank>birthright citizenship</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/25/guantanamo-trump-migrants-deportations-venezuela/\" target=_blank>sending migrants</a> to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/26/doge-federal-workforce-firings-job-cuts/\" target=_blank>federal workforce firings</a>, deep spending cuts and more.\nThe hirings are largely to fill openings created by the high number of civil division attorneys who have resigned since the 2024 presidential election, according to people familiar with the situation, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals and to discuss sensitive information.\nBut the effort also gives the Justice Department an opportunity to bring a slew of attorneys who align ideologically with the president into career positions in high-profile sections of the department.\nMultiple job postings say the Justice Department is seeking \u201cmany\u201d attorneys to work in its Federal Programs Branch and the Office of Immigration Litigation. Both departments are in the civil division, and their attorneys would be at the forefront of deportation fights and defending the most controversial executive branch policies, including a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/25/trump-refugee-ban-blocked/\" target=_blank>refugee ban</a>, terminations of government workers and the slashing of government agencies.\nThe attorneys would work under senior political appointees being hired to the Justice Department, many of whom are attorneys from conservative law firms and Republican state governments.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement agenda is a top national security priority that this Department of Justice is prepared to vigorously defend whenever challenged in court,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said in a statement.\nThe Justice Department is also planning to temporarily assign people to the civil divisions from other offices to defend Trump administration policies, according to a public listing on LinkedIn. At least some of those detailees could come from the civil rights division \u2014 an area of the Justice Department that is expected to have dwindling workload demands during the Trump administration.\nAnd attorneys in departments that do not typically deal with immigration enforcement are being asked to handle some immigration matters, the people familiar with the situation said.\nThe job listings, coupled with interviews with current and former Justice Department officials, suggest that the Trump administration is preparing for extensive and prolonged legal battles in court, with the department seeking both trial attorneys and those who specialize in the appeals process.\nAlready, the Trump administration is facing more than 80 lawsuits over its efforts to dramatically reshape the federal government and national policies. Several initiatives have been temporarily blocked by lower-court judges, and so far two have reached the Supreme Court.\nWhile many federal agencies are slashing probationary employees and laying off workers en masse, the Justice Department workforce has largely remained intact since Trump took office.\nHis administration has pushed out or transferred top career officials who held powerful jobs in agency, creating uncertainty and mistrust among the career workforce by according to people familiar. But it has not fired or laid off large swaths of rank and file attorneys or staff.\nStill, there has been high staff turnover in key divisions, creating an opportunity for the Trump administration to hire more career attorneys who strongly support its legal positions and approach.\nIn some government agencies, the federal hiring freeze mandated by the Trump White House has meant that they cannot replace people who quit. At Justice \u2014 with many jobs focused on Trump\u2019s priorities of boosting deportations and combating violent crime \u2014 the hirings have continued.\nAround a third of the 130 attorneys in the Federal Programs Branch have quit the Justice Department since Election Day, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. More resignations are expected as the workload and demands pile up, these people said.\nWhile federal law would prohibit Justice Department officials from asking about the political ideologies during the hiring process of career employees, legal experts said that the federal programs branch is always entwined with White House policies. In the Biden administration, for example, attorneys in this division defended the president\u2019s student loan forgiveness plans, covid mandates, challenges to firearm regulations and more.\nPeople who are strongly against Trump administration policies would be unlikely to apply for a job that would put them at the forefront of defending those policies, people familiar with how the branch works said.\nIn general, the office is filled with career staffers, a group of whom may disagree with any given administration, the people said. Career staffers and political appointees are supposed to work together to find strong strategies for defending presidential policies that meet legal muster \u2014 a process that often entails disagreements and workshopping legal arguments.\nBut some attorneys are frustrated because they are being asked simply to defend Trump\u2019s policies, with little room for discussion or dissent, according to a former civil division employee who is familiar with the branch\u2019s current dynamics.\nThe Office of Immigration Litigation is a division of more than 300 attorneys who typically handle the process of stripping citizenship from immigrants who commit crimes or have used fraud on their naturalization applications. These attorneys also defend the government when there is an appeal of a decision made in the administrative immigration courts.\n\nAn attorney from the Office of Immigration Litigation was also listed on the Trump administration\u2019s civil lawsuits against the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, which seek to block state and local protections for undocumented immigrants. Involvement in cases like this is unusual for the Office of Immigration Litigation, people familiar with the office said.\nThe Trump administration has also created a division focused on fighting what are known as \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d which are typically Democratic cities with a policy of protecting immigrants who are in the country illegally and not cooperating with federal authorities to deport them.\nJustice Department officials have transferred veteran career officials from other divisions \u2014 many of whom have little background in immigration law \u2014 to this office, giving them the option of quitting if they do not want to work there.\nThe office is reporting to the deputy attorney general. Officials say it is up and running, though it is unclear what litigation the office is working on."

        "content": "JERICHO, West Bank \u2014 The Trump administration has stopped all funding to the Palestinian Authority security forces as part of the global freeze on foreign assistance, according to U.S. and Palestinian officials.\nThe freeze comes at a critical time for the embattled authority as it struggles to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/11/palestinian-authority-secuirty-forces-west-bank-faq/\" target=_blank>maintain its rule</a> in pockets of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and jockeys to govern a postwar Gaza Strip. The security forces, which are chronically underfunded and widely unpopular, are nonetheless <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/05/palestinian-authority-security-forces-gaza/\" target=_blank>considered a linchpin to the Palestinian Authority\u2019s ability to maintain law and order</a> in both territories.\nWashington last stopped direct aid to the authority during Trump\u2019s first term but continued to fund training and reform for the security forces. Exercises and courses are run through the Jerusalem-based Office of the Security Coordinator \u2014 formerly known as the U.S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which is made up of a consortium of countries.\nBrig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, spokesman for the Palestinian security forces, told The Washington Post that the United States was considered a \u201cbig donor to the PA projects\u201d that included security training for the forces.\nA former Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue said that the Palestinian Authority security forces were \u201cnot affected in any meaningful way\u201d by the freeze and that \u201cother donors have committed to make up the shortfall.\u201d\nBut the freeze has already led to cuts in some training, a colonel at the authority\u2019s Central Training Institute for security forces told The Post on Tuesday. He spoke on the condition of anonymity per his office\u2019s protocol.\nA meeting planned with American officials this month to assess the authority\u2019s operation targeting militants in the Jenin refugee camp \u2014 which stopped after Israeli forces invaded last month \u2014 was postponed and has not been rescheduled, he said. Washington was also funding the building of a virtual shooting range, which the institute needs because Israel will not permit the importation of bullets for live-fire training sessions, the colonel said. Though the project was almost completed, the institute is seeking alternative funders because of the U.S. freeze, he said.\nConfirmation of the aid freeze comes amid widespread confusion about programs the Trump administration is saving or suspending.\nU.S. officials have been loath to specify <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/29/pepfar-trump-hiv-aids-aid-pause/\" target=_blank>what programs</a> are spared under exemptions issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio for \u201clifesaving\u201d assistance, aid to Israel, HIV prevention programs and other priorities. And even in cases when exemptions apply, aid organizations have in many cases been unable to continue to work because Rubio\u2019s directives have effectively shut down the payment systems required to draw down funds.\nThe United States has for years supported the Palestinian Authority security forces, viewing them as critical to Israel\u2019s security. The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has provided approximately $1.1 billion in civilian security and justice assistance to support the authority\u2019s security forces since 2007, the State Department said last year.\nThe Biden administration also backed proposals for the Palestinian Authority to play a key role in postwar Gaza, which both Israel and Hamas, the authority\u2019s internal rival, oppose.\nThe authority is struggling to control a new generation of Palestinian militancy in the West Bank that\u2019s centered in the territory\u2019s northern refugee camps and draws support from widespread frustration with the aging authority leadership, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, who is 89.\n\nThe State Department said the funding is under review but did not provide clarity on when a determination is likely to be made. \u201cThe Department and USAID paused nearly all foreign assistance,\u201d the department said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Agency for International Development. \u201cThe Department of State has granted waivers for critical programming that aligns with Administration priorities in the region.\u201d\n<i>Hudson reported from Washington.

No reason was provided.\nThe email warned members against forwarding the email.

Federal health officials pick the flu strains that the vaccine will target in advance of the flu season because the production process takes several months.\nThe FDA usually holds a meeting of its expert panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, in March to accommodate tight manufacturing deadlines and go over discussions about flu strain selection led by the World Health Organization.\nThe FDA advisory panel meeting includes public presentations from WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Defense, said Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and a critic of Kennedy\u2019s.\n\u201cWhat is the plan for picking this year\u2019s flu strain?\u201d Offit said.\nLast week, Trump officials <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/\">postponed</a> a three-day meeting of the vaccine advisory panel to the CDC that was scheduled to begin Wednesday.\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Kennedy repeatedly denied that he is anti-vaccine, contending that he is simply seeking more data and pledging not to undermine confidence in the shots. But public health experts have long warned that as HHS secretary, Kennedy could use his authority to undermine vaccine safety and effectiveness. A pivotal swing vote in Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) said he grappled with his vote but later said he had received a list of commitments from Kennedy that included protecting vaccine oversight.\nKennedy was critical of the CDC vaccine panel during his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/30/rfk-health-secretary-confirmation-hearings/\">confirmation process</a> and has argued that federal agencies are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/18/trump-health-firings-fda-cdc/\">captive</a> to the industries they regulate.\n\u201cWe will remove conflicts of interest on the committees and research partners whenever possible, or balance them with other stakeholders,\u201d Kennedy said in remarks to HHS staff earlier this month.\nAn executive order issued by President Donald Trump last week to reduce federal bureaucracy said White House officials would identify \u201cunnecessary governmental entities and Federal Advisory Committees that should be terminated on grounds that they are unnecessary.\u201d"

Administration officials must also provide examples of communication sent to partners on the ground about resuming assistance, Ali ruled.\nHis order applies to work done before Feb. 13.\nAid groups that are plaintiffs in the case provided evidence that the government has not lifted its suspension of funding, Ali said, and the defendants did not rebut that Tuesday.\nThe administration filed a notice of appeal late Tuesday afternoon. A spokesman has said officials will not discuss the pending litigation outside of court.\nDuring the contentious 90-minute hearing, Justice Department lawyer Indraneel Sur told Ali he was \u201cnot in a position to answer\u201d whether the Trump administration had taken needed steps to allow the assistance to begin moving.

Wirth, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, said in court.\nThe groups allege that instead of complying with Ali\u2019s directive, the Trump administration \u201cchose to take a series of new actions\u201d around access to a key reimbursement system, adding new approval processes and terminating \u201chundreds of critical personnel\u201d \u2014 \u201call but halting the disbursement of foreign-assistance funds,\u201d according to their emergency motion.\nDespite the State Department <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/28/state-department-foreign-aid-trump-waiver/\">granting a waiver</a> for certain lifesaving aid to resume, the plaintiffs contend, the payment system remains down, with employees seeing a variety of error messages when they try to submit invoices. Many organizations have not been paid for expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2024, before Trump returned to the White House.\nShould the government not comply by Ali\u2019s new deadline, \u201cwe are in uncharted and dangerous territory,\u201d Lauren Bateman, another attorney for the plaintiffs, noted via email after Tuesday\u2019s hearing.\nThe case is among several in which legal experts say the administration has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/20/trump-judge-orders-comply-defy-usaid/\">come close</a> to the red line of disobeying judicial orders as Trump and his allies assert vast<b> </b>presidential powers.\nThousands of federal workers have lost their jobs in recent weeks, adding to the chaos.

She did not say who would replace him.\nTrump has ordered ICE to carry out the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/interactive/2025/trump-immigrants-mass-deportations/?itid=ap_nickmiroff_9\" target=_blank>largest mass deportation campaign</a> in U.S. history and quickly ramp up the number of immigrants it arrests each day. Despite the administration dedicating a rush of resources to the effort that has included sending thousands of troops to the southern border and assigning thousands of agents and officers from the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies, ICE\u2019s budget and staffing remain largely unchanged, leaving officers scrambling to meet aggressive arrest quotas.\nIn late January, Vitello told ICE\u2019s 25 field office directors they should arrest at least 75 immigrants per day for a national <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/26/ice-arrests-raids-trump-quota/\" target=_blank>daily total of 1,200 to 1,500</a>. ICE officers have been working six and even seven days a week since then, but Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem and Trump \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan have blamed agency officials for falling far short of those goals. Homan did not respond to requests for comment.\nLouisiana Secretary of Wildlife and Fisheries<b> </b>Madison Sheahan, a former campaign aide to Noem, is expected to become acting deputy director of ICE, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a position that hadn\u2019t been publicly announced. Sheahan was also <a href=\"https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2023/01/19/sheahan-named-executive-director-sd-gop/\" target=_blank>executive director</a> of the South Dakota GOP. A DHS official said that \u201cpositions are being reevaluated\u201d and that the agency had \u201cnothing new to announce at this time.\u201d\nICE averaged more than 800 arrests per day nationwide in late January in the 10 days after Trump took office, publishing its results on social media amid a publicity campaign that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/28/new-york-city-ice-raid/\" target=_blank>invited television crews</a> to embed with officers. The pace of arrests slowed during the first two weeks of February to fewer than 600 daily, and ICE stopped publishing data on social media, saying it would move to a monthly format.\nCurrent and former ICE officials said the enforcement blitz in late January depleted the lists of targets ICE developed before Trump took office with the names, addresses and other data on immigrants they could arrest. Officer teams have not had time to build out new target lists.\nOfficers have also struggled to meet their quotas because many immigrants are refusing to open their doors when ICE officers knock, according to three ICE officials. Noem has accused FBI agents of leaking sensitive information about upcoming immigration enforcement operations, which the law enforcement agency has pushed back on.<b> </b>The enforcement teams generally do not possess criminal arrest warrants that would allow them to force their way into their targets\u2019 residences. ICE officials say they can\u2019t afford to leave teams of officers waiting for targeted immigrants to leave their homes.\nVitello\u2019s demotion follows the reassignment this month of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/11/ice-enforcement-officials-reassigned/\" target=_blank>top two officials at ICE\u2019s enforcement division</a>.\nA Trump administration official said that Vitello will now oversee field and enforcement operations as part of an effort to expand the team. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the personnel move, said Noem made the decision and it was not done at Trump\u2019s direction.\nVitello\u2019s removal was first reported Friday by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ice-leadership-changes-trump-deportations-1856e1bb\" target=_blank>The Wall Street Journal</a>. Several ICE staffers said news of his demotion caught them by surprise, and they found out through news alerts.\nJason Houser, chief of staff for ICE under President Joe Biden, said that the White House is asking ICE to \u201cdefy the math\u201d and do things that are \u201cunrealistic.\u201d\n\u201cThe White House needs to look in the mirror,\u201d Houser said. \u201cThe dysfunction isn\u2019t with ICE rank-and-file who are trying to do their jobs effectively.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has sought to take an<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/ice-arrests-immigration-deportations/\" target=_blank> all-of-government approach </a>to immigration enforcement, treating it as a near wartime effort. At least 3,600 servicemen and servicewomen have been sent to the border, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/border-soldiers-texas-migrants-trump/\" target=_blank>according to the </a>Defense Department. The administration has used military planes to transport migrants to locations as far away as India. As ICE has run out of space in its detention centers, the Trump administration has started to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/16/trump-guantanamo-migrants-deportations-venezuela/\" target=_blank>send migrants to the Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base in Cuba</a>, where Trump ordered the construction of a detention camp with 30,000 beds. On Thursday, 177 Venezuelan migrants  at Guant\u00e1namo were <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/20/guantanamo-migrants-trump-deportations-honduras/\" target=_blank>deported</a> to their homeland.\nHoman has said he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with the results so far. Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) said recently that Homan came to the Hill \u201cbegging\u201d for additional money. The Senate adopted a budget blueprint early Friday  for legislation to increase border security and immigration enforcement by $175 billion. Trump has backed a competing, more expansive plan in the House.\nThe Biden administration deported 271,000 people in fiscal year 2024, the highest annual total in a decade. Deportations during Trump\u2019s first term reached a peak of about 267,000 during the 2019 fiscal year, even as he made similar promises. ICE would need to deport more than 2,700 people a day to hit 1 million deportations a year, a goal that veteran immigration officials say is improbable."

        "headline": "Judge allows intelligence agencies to fire officers in DEI roles",
        "content": "A federal judge on Thursday refused to stop the CIA and director of national intelligence from firing 51 officers who had been assigned to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility roles that were scrapped last month by President Donald Trump. The officers may not appeal to civil service boards, and they may not transfer to other jobs in the intelligence community because agency rules allow the director to fire employees without any recourse.\nIn three court hearings this month, U.S. District Judge Anthony J. Trenga questioned why the Trump administration decided to fire all of the officials instead of reassigning them, as had been recommended by career-services officials at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\u201cThese are talented, experienced assets, if you will, that would be in the interests of the United States to be reassigned elsewhere, if that need existed,\u201d Trenga said at a hearing Monday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.\nBut government lawyers said CIA Director John Ratcliffe relied on a regulation particular to the intelligence community stating that \u201cany employee may be terminated from the Agency at any time without regard to any procedural steps \u2026 when the [director], in his discretion, deems it necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States.\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Dennis Barghaan said that prevented the employees from being reassigned.\nKevin T. Carroll, a lawyer for the fired officers, argued that \u201cin the interest of the United States\u201d meant that the employee was being fired for reasons related to national security, and that there should be individualized findings before anyone is released. But Trenga said the court didn\u2019t have jurisdiction over an administrative claim unless the agency waived its sovereign immunity, and that the officers probably wouldn\u2019t prevail on the issues that their First Amendment right to free speech and their Fifth Amendment right to due process were violated.\n\u201cIn effect, they are at-will employees,\u201d the judge ruled. \u201cThe regulations make it clear they have no property interest in the employment they have.\u201d\nAs the disappointed officers looked on, Carroll said afterward: \u201cWe respect the court\u2019s decision. I would certainly hope, given the judge\u2019s remarks, that Director Ratcliffe would consider allowing the plaintiffs to apply for other jobs.\u201d He said one of the fired officers had eight other job offers within the CIA, as a data scientist, but was prevented from accepting one.\nThe lawsuit was filed by 19 anonymous intelligence officers who said they had been temporarily assigned to DEI roles within their agencies and were now being scapegoated \u201cin the service of a partisan ideological agenda.\u201d Some of the employees have been on the job for two decades, according to court records. Ten of the employees were in court for Thursday\u2019s ruling, but declined to comment afterward.\nEarlier, Carroll said the career intelligence officers had been trained at taxpayers\u2019 expense to perform some of the most sensitive spy jobs \u2014 \u201cfrom source development to recruitment\u201d and \u201ccollection to analysis\u201d \u2014 and that they were being fired despite being qualified for other open positions at their agencies. Some stand to lose the government pensions they had been working toward for years, the lawyer said.\n\u201cNone of these officers\u2019 activities was or is illegal, and at no time have the agencies employing Plaintiffs contended that they individually engaged in any misconduct, nor are they accused of poor performance,\u201d Carroll said in a legal filing. Their job duties included \u201cadvancing the hiring, promotion and advancement of members of protected classes,\u201d and firing them for performing assigned work would violate their constitutional rights, he said.\nAccording to court records, the officers were placed on administrative leave with pay two days after Trump signed an executive order last month terminating all DEI programs in the executive branch. Weeks later, some of the officers were told to report to their agencies\u2019 visitor centers with their badges and without lawyers. That\u2019s what it looks like when an intelligence community member is about to get fired or placed on leave without pay, one of the anonymous CIA officers said in a court filing.\nThe intelligence officer defended the need for diversity among the agency\u2019s ranks. Blending in \u201cracially and culturally\u201d among foreign populations is key to intelligence collection, he said. \u201cThere are needs for dual citizenship documentation, foreign language skills and/or overseas living experiences,\u201d the officer said, noting that in some cultural settings, women will not meet alone with men.\nJustice Department attorneys said in a legal filing that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard had not finalized any plans to fire officers in DEI roles. But Gabbard and Ratcliffe have unqualified authority to fire any of their employees, and Ratcliffe has chosen to use it, the attorneys argued.\nRatcliffe in a court filing said he could terminate any CIA employee under provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, \u201cwhen, in my discretion, I deem it \u2018necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.\u2019 \u201d Shutting down the CIA\u2019s diversity and inclusion office and firing all its employees met that standard, he said.\nThe DEI-related firings could affect not just the 19 intelligence officers who sued but a total of 51 employees at the CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence, their attorneys said. At the CIA, they said, the mass ouster \u201csuggests an unlawful effort \u2026 to misuse the Director\u2019s unique national security-related authorities to evade federal equal opportunity laws.\u201d\nTrenga said he was puzzled by the CIA\u2019s decision not to reassign the officers. Agency regulations state that any employees who are terminated as part of a downsizing should be offered open positions, he said. Justice Department attorneys said Ratcliffe fired the employees under a different regulation that provides no such job protections.\n\u201cI frankly don\u2019t quite understand why that\u2019s being resisted by the agency,\u201d the judge said at the hearing Monday. Trenga was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush and presides over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in addition to serving as a federal district court judge in Virginia.\nAttorneys for the CIA officers said the agency\u2019s career service has identified at least one suitable open position for each of them."

Dellinger said the firings of those employees, and potentially many others, were <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/24/hampton-dellinger-special-counsel-filing-probationary-employees/\" target=\"_blank\">probably illegal</a>.\nIn court Wednesday morning, Jackson sharply questioned claims by the Trump administration\u2019s lawyer that Trump had the power to fire Dellinger without cause and that the law prohibiting him from doing so was unconstitutional. Unlike other agency heads, the special counsel was granted independence from the president to investigate potential wrongdoing by the administration, the judge said. Dellinger was appointed to a five-year term that ends in 2029.\n\u201cHis actual job is to be a check and balance on the president,\u201d Jackson said.\nThe judge pressed Justice Department lawyer Madeline McMahon to explain why it would be in the public interest to fire Dellinger.\nMcMahon said barring Dellinger\u2019s removal would cause Trump to \u201close control over an executive branch agency\u201d and would represent an \u201cintrusion\u201d into Trump\u2019s authority under the Constitution."

        "headline": "Layoffs to hit IRS as DOGE targets tax collections",
        "content": "The Trump administration is expected to begin laying off thousands of employees at the Internal Revenue Service, six people briefed on the matter said, as billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s team begins to target tax collections.\nTreasury officials have discussed laying off roughly 9,000 employees still in their probationary period as part of broader dismissals across the government of recently hired workers, according to the six people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal conversations. That number could not be immediately confirmed, and spokespeople both for the IRS and Treasury declined to comment. The cuts could start as soon as Friday.\nThe layoffs are likely targeting tax collection, several of the people briefed on the matter said. Indeed, associates of Musk\u2019s team are beginning to meet with high-ranking IRS officials about what could prove dramatic changes to the tax agency. Gavin Kliger, a software engineer now working at the IRS, met with Ken Corbin, the IRS\u2019s chief of taxpayer services, and Heather Maloy, the agency\u2019s top enforcement official, during his first day at the agency\u2019s headquarters Thursday, according to several of the people familiar with the meetings.\nRepublicans have long aimed to shrink the tax agency and were particularly incensed by the Biden administration\u2019s push to hire thousands of new IRS agents to increase tax enforcement and collections. The cuts to federal personnel are likely to weaken the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to bolster the IRS, though to what extent remains uncertain.\nThe tax agency grew by about 10 percent last year, as its ranks swelled from roughly 90,000 employees in fiscal year 2023 to 100,000 employees this fiscal year. The IRS has said publicly that personnel critical to the tax filing season are ineligible for the \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d plan that encouraged federal personnel to quit. That has fueled speculation that the cuts to IRS personnel will be concentrated among the agency\u2019s tax collection staff, which could reduce the amount of revenue brought into federal coffers even as Musk calls for a reduced deficit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite distressing, because the Biden administration made serious efforts to bolster enforcement. I think all of that is in jeopardy now,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, who served as a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. \u201cStripping the IRS of resources is a windfall for those who like to game the system, and those are the most sophisticated and richest taxpayers.\u201d\nCongressional Republicans are likely to welcome DOGE\u2019s changes to the IRS. On Thursday, Rep. Jason T. Smith (R-Missouri), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, wrote a letter to IRS\u2019s acting commissioner blasting the $80 billion funding increase for the tax agency, among other measures.\n\u201cPresident Trump has shown in his first three weeks that he meant what he said during the presidential campaign. Our government has not been working effectively for the American people, and it needs to change,\u201d Smith\u2019s letter states.\nCongress had given <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/06/inflation-reduction-act-irs/\" target=\"_blank\">the IRS $80 billion</a> over 10 years through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, but<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/26/irs-funding-cut-20-billion-shutdown/\" target=\"_blank\"> Congress rescinded $20 billion</a> of that.\nWithin the agency, the impending job cuts are being met with dread, both for individuals and the health of the tax system. The vast majority of Treasury employees work for the IRS.\nIRS employees cheered the Biden administration\u2019s funding boosts, which yielded almost immediate performance and IT improvements. Now rolling those back \u2014 and cutting thousands of freshly hired employees \u2014 could send the agency into a tailspin in the middle of filing season.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like going off a cliff immediately,\u201d said David Carrone, a revenue agent and president of the Louisiana-Arkansas National Treasury Employees Union chapter.\n<i>Isaac Arnsdorf contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "The Pentagon said Friday that it will fire about 5,400 civilian employees beginning next week in an \u201cinitial\u201d purge of its workforce, as President Donald Trump\u2019s hastily issued orders to shake up the Defense Department faced new scrutiny and officials scrambled to understand whether such actions could imperil national security.\nThe announcement followed a day of uncertainty, as administration officials paused a plan to begin firings now while evaluating requests to retain thousands of other employees deemed essential. A senior Pentagon official, Darin Selnick, said in a statement late Friday that the Trump administration intends to cull its workforce by between 5 and 8 percent. With more than 900,000 civilian employees in the Defense Department, tens of thousands of people could be forced out eventually.\nEchoing <a href=\"https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1892702578418327972\" target=_blank>a pronouncement</a> made earlier by Trump\u2019s defense secretary,<b> </b>Pete Hegseth, Selnick said in his statement that \u201cit is simply not in the public interest to retain individuals whose contributions are not mission-critical.\u201d\n\u201cTaxpayers deserve to have us take a thorough look at our workforce top-to-bottom to see where we can eliminate redundancies,\u201d Selnick added. The cuts are necessary, he said, \u201cto produce efficiencies and refocus\u201d the Pentagon on Trump\u2019s national security priorities.\nThe firings are not expected to target U.S. troops. The Pentagon oversees about 1.3 million active-duty service members and nearly 800,000 more who are in the National Guard and reserves.\nThe cuts will come after Trump administration officials, coordinating with billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s U.S. DOGE Service, have slashed thousands of employees elsewhere in the government as part of the president\u2019s broad effort to dismantle the federal bureaucracy.\nThe Defense Department\u2019s civilian worker purge is beginning with probationary employees, those who have one to three years of experience or who recently were promoted, according to officials familiar with the matter, who like some others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue\u2019s sensitivity. That pool of people numbers between 50,000 and 55,000, officials said.\nAfter deliberations over the last day, the Pentagon has settled on firing about 10 percent of its probational employees, a defense official familiar with the effort said. A hiring freeze is expected to take hold next week, and administration officials plan to spend two to three months analyzing who else could be ousted, the official said.\nSupervisors throughout the department, the federal government\u2019s largest, have spent days requesting of the new administration that certain employees should be spared because the work they do is vital to national defense. An email obtained by The Washington Post indicates that Trump officials ultimately decided they need more time to sort through those many cases.\nThe message, sent Thursday night by Ruth Vetter, a lawyer in the Pentagon general counsel\u2019s office, said that senior officials had informed human resources staff that \u201cthey should not initiate removals of probationary employees\u201d on Friday because requests for exemptions citing mission criticality \u201care still under review.\u201d\nVetter\u2019s email, labeled \u201cPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL,\u201d warned that an employee\u2019s past performance \u201cmust be viewed through the current needs and best interest of the government, in light of the President\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\u201d\nVetter referred questions to Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot, who did not respond to requests for comment.\nAmong the agency\u2019s probationary employees are hundreds of teachers who work for the Department of Defense Education Activity, a school system that educates about 67,000 students \u2014 mostly the children of service members \u2014 at military installations around the globe. One person familiar with the matter said that DoDEA officials were attempting to save teachers from Trump\u2019s purge of the federal workforce, but it was unclear if the effort would be successful. A DoDEA spokesman declined to comment.\nAt the Office of Naval Intelligence, which provides senior military officials with maritime threat assessments and related analysis, employees were called to a meeting Thursday at their headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, where they were told that all probationary workers would be terminated, said one intelligence analyst.\nThe analyst went to work Friday expecting to be out of a job, but was informed that no further instructions had been received. \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up too much,\u201d he said he was told.\nThe analyst, an Air Force veteran, said about 60 people in his office could be fired, and voiced frustration that he and his colleagues are seen by DOGE officials as numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\u201cWork is next to impossible right now,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cMorale is through the floor.\u201d\nCoinciding with the civilian-worker purge, U.S. defense officials, acting on orders from Hegseth, have undertaken a sprawling effort to compile options for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/19/trump-pentagon-budget-cuts/\" target=_blank>slashing about 8 percent</a> from each armed service\u2019s budget for each of the next five years. Doing so, Hegseth has said, could yield $50 billion in 2026 to be reinvested elsewhere in the Defense Department, including an expensive missile-defense shield that Trump has taken to calling \u201cIron Dome For America.\u201d\nAfter news of Hegseth\u2019s directive alarmed lawmakers and defense officials, the former Fox News personality sought to blame the news media for causing confusion about the administration\u2019s efforts and portrayed his plan as a \u201creorienting\u201d of the Pentagon budget away from \u201cwoke, Biden-era nonlethal programs\u201d to \u201cinstead spend that money on President Trump\u2019s America First, peace-through-strength priorities for our national budget.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a cut,\u201d Hegseth said in a nearly <a href=\"https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1892702578418327972\" target=_blank>nine-minute video</a> posted to social media on Thursday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s refocusing and reinvesting existing funds into building a force to protect you, the American people.\u201d\nBut independent budget analysts said it is highly unlikely that tens of billions of dollars per year can be targeted for reinvestment without slashing some major weapons programs and cutting the number troops in some of the services.\nTravis Sharp, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the fiscal 2025 budget under President Joe Biden included $162 million for diversity, equity and inclusion programs and $3.6 billion to build resiliency at Defense Department installations to counter climate change. Even if all of that money is removed from the budget and reprogrammed, he said, it\u2019s a \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d at getting to $50 billion.\nTo achieve such an ambitious goal, Sharp said, the Pentagon could retire older weapons programs, eliminate newer ones that remain in development, and shrink or shutter individual headquarters and agencies. Similar efforts have been undertaken before, Sharp said, including by Defense Secretary Robert Gates under President Barack Obama, but they still fell well short of Hegseth\u2019s goals.\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re attempting is unprecedented in recent history,\u201d Sharp said.\nMackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said it will take an \u201call of the above\u201d approach to cut that deeply into existing defense budget to fund new efforts. She noted that in a memo to senior Pentagon officials on Tuesday, Hegseth \u201cwalled off\u201d 17 key priorities identified by the Trump administration \u2014 including missile defense, submarines, one-way attack drones and border security. So other areas will be especially vulnerable.\n\u201cLook, the Defense Department reflects America,\u201d she said. \u201cThe largest line item on the balance sheet of most corporations is labor. It\u2019s people. There\u2019s no workforce you can spare. They\u2019re going to have to go after the defense civilian workforce as well as active-duty military end strength.\u201d\nAnother option the Trump administration could pursue, especially if it seeks to slash billions of dollars in future years for new priorities, is the closure of some existing military bases, Eaglen said. Such efforts \u2014 commonly known as base realignment and closure \u2014 have been politically unpopular, but could be appealing to Musk, she predicted.\n\u201cThere is a very compelling case for base closure,\u201d Eaglen said. \u201cIf you kind of get into those weeds with people, you can make a rational business case. I actually think Congress could be compelled with a bully [defense secretary] and bully White House.\u201d\n<i>Warren P. Strobel contributed to this report.</i>"

He is expected to be replaced on a temporary basis by Melanie Krause, who has also served in senior positions at the tax agency, the people said. President Trump has nominated <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/05/billy-long-irs-commissioner-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">Billy Long</a>, a former Republican congressman from Missouri, to run the agency on a more permanent basis, if he is confirmed by the Senate.\nO\u2019Donnell\u2019s expected departure comes at a pivotal time for the IRS, which faces a crush from tax filing season and fresh scrutiny from Musk\u2019s team.\nThe people familiar with the matter said O\u2019Donnell was concerned by many of the moves Musk made on the government, including firing probationary employees. As part of Musk-driven cuts, about 7,000 IRS employees are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/20/irs-layoffs-trump-firings-doge/\" target=_blank>expected to lose their jobs</a>, a person familiar with the matter has said.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has fired government agency watchdogs and officials who protect whistleblowers, in addition to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/28/trump-fire-eeoc-nlrb-board-members/\" target=_blank>members of the boards of<b> </b>three independent federal agencies</a> that oversee swaths of U.S. workers, employers and labor unions.\nThe board terminations appear to violate laws that protect certain agency leaders from being fired by the president<b> </b>without cause, potentially setting up a test of the boundaries of presidential power before the Supreme Court.\nIn a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) on Wednesday, the administration outlined its legal defense of the commissioner firings and appeared to be counting on a conservative Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/supreme-court-donald-trump-test-cases-presidential-authority/\" target=_blank>to be receptive to the president\u2019s expansive views</a> of executive authority.\n\u201cThe Department of Justice has determined that certain for-cause removal provisions that apply to members of multimember regulatory commissions are unconstitutional and that the Department will no longer defend their constitutionality,\u201d acting solicitor general Sarah M. Harris wrote.\nSuch letters are<b> </b>required by Congress when the administration has decided not to defend a federal statute. It essentially put lawmakers<b> </b>on notice that<b> </b>the administration<b> </b>is willing to urge the justices to overturn the 1935 Supreme Court ruling in <i>Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. U.S.</i>, which has protected members of regulatory agencies<b> </b>such as the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe Constitution gives the president the power to remove top executive branch officials for any reason at all, but Congress passed legislation that said those officials may not be fired without cause, an attempt to ensure their independence. The Trump administration\u2019s position would give the president more control over those agencies and essentially treat their leaders more like Cabinet secretaries.\nIn response, Durbin said members of independent, bipartisan agencies such as the NLRB and FTC, which safeguard consumers and workers, have long been protected from removal at the whim of the president. The Trump administration\u2019s push to overturn a nearly century-old Supreme Court precedent, he said in a statement, is a \u201cstriking reversal of the Justice Department\u2019s long-standing position under Republican and Democratic presidents alike.\u201d\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move drew praise from conservatives such as Ed Whelan, a commentator and distinguished senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. He<b> </b>wrote in his newsletter Thursday that the administration is \u201crejecting \u2014 soundly, in my view \u2014 the notion that Congress may limit the president\u2019s ability to remove principal officers of executive-branch agencies.\u201d\nBut Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor and co-director of the school\u2019s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, said the administration\u2019s position amounted to a power grab with Trump wanting<b> </b>\u201cto get rid of anyone who is not in his thrall.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to turn the entire federal government into an episode of \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 where he screams \u2018You\u2019re fired\u2019 at everybody,\u201d she said, making a reference to the president\u2019s former<b> </b>reality TV show.\nIn late January, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/05/trump-lawsuit-nlrb-board-members-firing/\" target=_blank>Trump fired Gwynne Wilcox</a>, a Biden nominee on the NLRB whose term was set to expire in 2028. Wilcox filed a lawsuit alleging that her dismissal defied \u201cSupreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies.\u201d\nThe suit says that while Wilcox \u201chas no desire to aid the President in establishing a test case,\u201d she is also aware \u201cof the fact that, if no challenge is made, the President will have effectively succeeded in rendering\u201d invalid \u201cthe NLRB\u2019s protections \u2014 and, by extension, that of other independent agencies.\u201d\nThe NLRB \u2014 which oversees unionization votes by workers and adjudicates allegations of labor law violations \u2014 has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/21/musk-trump-nlrb-amazon-spacex/\" target=_blank>faced a flurry of legal challenges</a> to its constitutionality over the past year, including by SpaceX and Amazon (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post). Workers are already being affected by Wilcox\u2019s firing, including a group of Philadelphia Whole Foods employees who voted to unionize the same day she was removed.\nWhole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, objected to the union\u2019s win on the grounds that, without Wilcox, the National Labor Relations Board lacks a quorum and therefore doesn\u2019t have the authority to certify the election result. Legal experts said the argument is invalid.\nIn <i>Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. U.S.</i>, the Supreme Court said Congress could stop the president from firing without good reason a member of the Federal Trade Commission. Specifically, the high court said President Franklin D. Roosevelt could not remove one of the FTC commissioners because of their political differences.\nEver since the Reagan administration, the conservative legal movement has advocated a robust view of presidential power known as the \u201cunitary executive theory\u201d in which the president controls all executive decisions without restraint from Congress. The theory played a role in 2020, when the court ruled 5-4 that the structure of another independent watchdog agency was unconstitutional and that the president could fire without cause the director of the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-7_n6io.pdf\" target=_blank>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>.\nThat decision did not overrule the directive in <i>Humphrey\u2019s Executor </i>that Congress can restrict the president\u2019s power to fire officials at \u201cmultimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power.\u201d\nBut Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote separately to call for the ruling to be overturned, saying the precedent<b> </b>\u201cposes a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people.\u201d\nIt is not clear<b> </b>how many of the<b> </b>other justices would agree with Thomas and Gorsuch if given the opportunity in a future case.<b> </b>The court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority, with three justices nominated by Trump, last year overturned<b> </b>another long-standing ruling targeted by conservatives<b> </b>that required judges to defer to the reasonable interpretations of agency experts.\nGillian E. Metzger, a Columbia Law School professor who was deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel during the Biden administration, said recent rulings have created openings for presidents<b> </b>to try to increase their authority over agencies.\nThe Trump administration is \u201cpushing to see how far they can get those to go,\u201d she added, calling the departure from precedent that was signaled in the solicitor general\u2019s letter part of a \u201cvery broad effort to hobble and denigrate core institutions of the federal government.\u201d\nIn her letter to Congress, Harris mentioned three independent, multimember regulator agencies whose commissioners \u201cexercise substantial executive power\u201d: the National Labor Relations Board, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. She<b> </b>said the Supreme Court\u2019s 1935 ruling \u201cprevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the Executive Branch who execute the laws on the President\u2019s behalf.\u201d\nBut the same rationale could apply to other agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. The Supreme Court, legal experts said, may be wary about calling into question the structure of the Federal Reserve, in particular, because of the potential destabilizing effects on monetary policy.\n\u201cWhere would they draw the line?\u201d asked Patrick Schmidt, a political science professor and co-director of legal studies at Macalester College.\n<i>Caroline O\u2019Donovan contributed to this report.</i>"

The agency is responsible for education research, evaluation of programs and collection of a vast amount of data about American schools.\nThe vast majority of the work of this agency is done by contractors, so canceling their work will have a significant impact on its ability to function, they said.\nThe canceled contracts were identified by a team of workers from the Department of Government Efficiency service, known as DOGE. The list includes some functions required by statutes.\nNotices to contractors were sent Monday, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak. He said they were canceled \u201cfor convenience,\u201d a provision that allows for a contract to be terminated without finding fault.\nMadi Biedermann, spokeswoman for the department, said three popular programs run by the research arm of the agency were spared: the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a set of nationally representative tests to measure student progress over time, the College Scorecard and the College Navigator.\nBiedermann said the canceled contracts would be rebid in hopes of getting the same or better work done at a lower cost. She said she did not know how or why DOGE concluded that these particular contractors are overpaid or underdelivering.\n\u201cThe significant amount of money as compared to the outcomes generated for students is not commensurate,\u201d she said. She said they are \u201clooking for vendors to generate better outcomes for students.\u201d\nAsked how DOGE workers have the requisite expertise to make these determinations, she said, \u201cThe entire goal of DOGE is to cut waste, and they have been trained to identify that.\u201d\nBiedermann said 90 contracts worth $900 million were canceled.

Biden commuted their sentences to life in prison without parole. While Trump cannot undo those commutations, he raised the possibility that his administration could encourage local officials to seek new death sentences for them.\nWriting in the order, Trump directed his attorney general to examine whether those people could be charged with state-level capital crimes and then \u201crecommend appropriate action to state and local authorities.\u201d\nIn addition to broadly requesting that the Justice Department seek more federal death sentences, Trump directed the attorney general to seek death \u201cfor every federal capital crime\u201d in which a law enforcement officer is murdered or the defendant is in the country illegally.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, the Justice Department restarted executions and carried out 13, including some in the days leading up to Biden\u2019s inauguration. Under Biden, the Justice Department imposed a moratorium blocking new executions, but prosecutors also continued to seek new death sentences.\nBiden\u2019s action commuting sentences last month left three men on federal death row: the surviving Boston Marathon bomber; the Charleston, South Carolina, church gunman; and the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman, who was prosecuted and sentenced to death during Biden\u2019s term.\nTrump has long been a vocal supporter of the death penalty. Capital punishment\u2019s use nationwide has waned in recent decades, with executions and new death sentences plummeting. A Washington Post examination <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2024/death-row-inmates-us-executions/\" target=_blank>last year</a> found that many of the 2,100 people on death row appeared likely to die there without being executed.\nOfficials in some states have not sought to carry out executions, but in other cases, authorities say they have struggled to obtain the drugs needed for lethal injections. Trump\u2019s order also directs his attorney general to make sure that states with the death penalty have the necessary drugs for lethal injections."

Also disqualified are service members who have been treated for gender dysphoria with hormones or surgery.\nThe memo directs the secretaries of each branch to identify service members with gender dysphoria within 30 days and to \u201cbegin separation actions\u201d within 30 days after that.\nThe affected service members will be honorably discharged as long as they meet normal conditions and qualify for involuntary separation pay, the memo states. If they voluntarily step down, they will be eligible to be paid twice as much under voluntary separation pay, it said.\nThe memo also states that the military will no longer pay for any treatments or surgery relating to service members\u2019 gender dysphoria.\nEven if a transgender service member obtains a waiver to stay in the military, they will face restrictions, the memo says. They cannot access \u201cintimate spaces,\u201d including changing rooms, bathrooms and showers, reserved for members of the gender they transitioned to. They will also have to meet the same physical<b> </b>standards as those of the sex they were assigned at birth, and their military records will be updated to reflect their sex assigned at birth.\nAbout 4,200 service members have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to a senior defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Trump administration. That figure includes active-duty, reserve and National Guard personnel.\nBetween 2015 and 2024, the military spent about $52 million on transgender service members\u2019<b> </b>psychotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery and other treatments, the senior defense official said. About 1,000 service members had transition-related surgeries during that period, while about 3,200 received hormone therapy, the official said.\nOpenly transgender people have been allowed to serve in the military since 2016, when the Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/06/30/the-pentagons-ban-on-transgender-service-just-fell-but-the-details-are-complicated/\" target=_blank>repealed a ban on transgender service</a>, citing the value of ensuring that all qualified individuals were able to serve their country in uniform. Previously, the military considered transgender people to be unfit for service.\nObama had also, in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/military-certifies-repeal-of-dont-ask-policy/2011/07/22/gIQAye15TI_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d</a> a policy that prohibited openly gay service members from serving, and, in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/12/03/pentagon-chief-to-announce-how-womens-roles-in-the-military-will-expand/\" target=\"_blank\">opened more combat roles to women</a>. In 2016, Rand published a <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1530.html\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> that found those changes in long-standing policy \u201chad no significant effect on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness\u201d and that concluded there was a \u201cminimal likely impact on force readiness\u201d from allowing openly transgender people to serve too.\nIn subsequent years, military leaders reported no significant harm from allowing openly transgender people to serve. In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2018, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley told Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) that he had \u201creceived precisely zero reports of issues of cohesion, discipline, morale\u201d caused by integrating transgender service members.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, the Defense Department effectively prohibited transgender people from joining the military but allowed those already in uniform to stay on. The policy was challenged in court, but the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-allows-trump-restrictions-on-transgender-troops-in-military-to-go-into-effect-as-legal-battle-continues/2019/01/22/e68a7284-1763-11e9-88fe-f9f77a3bcb6c_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">upheld Trump\u2019s partial ban in 2019</a>.

        "content": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico extradited 29 alleged drug traffickers to the United States on Thursday, including Rafael Caro Quintero, a prized target long sought in the killing of a U.S. narcotics agent, and two leaders of the hyper-violent Zetas cartel, in a dramatic gesture apparently aimed at heading off crushing economic sanctions, according to U.S. officials.\nPresident Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on Mexico next week for what he calls its failure to stop drugs \u2014 especially fentanyl \u2014 from crossing the border. A high-level Mexican delegation met Thursday with senior Trump administration officials in an effort to hammer out a deal to avoid the economic penalties.\n\u201cTwenty-nine, that\u2019s huge! What they\u2019ve done is literally cleaned out the cupboard,\u201d said John Feeley, a former U.S. diplomat who served as deputy chief of mission in Mexico from 2009 to 2012. Normally, he said, extraditions of major capos were handled one by one, often involving long negotiations. But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was \u201cpulling out all the stops\u201d to avoid the tariffs, he said.\nThe government <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/sspc/prensa/tarjeta-informativa-391650\" target=_blank>did not identify those extradited</a>. But the U.S. Justice Department said in a news release that  they included <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/07/23/mexico-drug-trafficker-caro-quintero/\" target=_blank>Caro Quintero</a>, who was long the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s most-wanted man. He was accused in the murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena in Mexico in 1985. Caro Quintero was freed from a Mexican prison on a technicality in 2013, to the outrage of DEA officials. After years of pursuing the drug lord, Mexican troops finally arrested him again in 2022.\nAlso sent to the United States were Miguel \u00c1ngel and Omar Trevi\u00f1o Morales, according to the DOJ statement.  Their Zetas cartel dominated much of central and northern Mexico starting around 2007. The group was dismantled a decade ago by the Mexican armed forces, but U.S. authorities alleged the brothers continued to run a Zetas offshoot,  the Northeast cartel, from a Mexican prison.\nThe DOJ release said Mexico carried out the extraditions in response to a recent decision by Trump to designate six Mexican cartels as terrorist groups. The Mexican government did not comment, beyond a brief statement saying the 29 people were sought \u201cbecause of their ties to criminal organizations\u201d involved in drug trafficking.\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown, a drug-policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, said the extraditions are \u201call part and parcel of the package the Mexican government is putting on the table to avoid the 25 percent tariffs.\u201d Mexico also has been alarmed by suggestions from some Trump administration officials that U.S. military strikes should be carried out to weaken the cartels.\nWhile the extraditions were welcome, the U.S. government should instead emphasize a broader demand for law enforcement to actively collaborate with Mexico in rounding up and dismantling criminal networks, Felbab-Brown said.\n\nThe Caro Quintero case has long been extremely sensitive for the DEA; U.S. officials at the highest levels had pressed Mexico to find and rearrest him after he managed to leave prison. He is accused of ordering the kidnapping of Camarena, allegedly as a punishment for the agent\u2019s investigations. Camarena\u2019s body was found on March 5, 1985, in a plastic bag on a remote Mexican ranch.\nThe murder was a central plotline of the Netflix series \u201cNarcos, Mexico.\u201d\nCaro Quintero \u201chas spent four decades atop DEA\u2019s most wanted fugitive list,\u201d said the agency\u2019s acting administrator, Derek S. Maltz. \u201cThis moment is extremely personal for the men and women of DEA.\u201d\nCaro Quintero, 72, was being sent to New York, the  DOJ said. He faces charges of leading a criminal organization and participating in the kidnapping, torture and murder of Camarena. Prosecutors have accused his drug organization of sending tons of methamphetamines, cocaine and heroin from Mexico to the United States from 1980 to 2017.\nThe Trevi\u00f1o Morales brothers have been indicted in the District of Columbia on charges of \u201ctrafficking massive quantities of narcotics into the United States,\u201d Nicole Argentieri, then-head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, said in October.\nThe Zetas were originally formed as an armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. Many of the group\u2019s early members were recruited from Mexican army special-forces troops. The group was known for its extreme cruelty \u2014 including beheading its enemies, killing Central American migrants it suspected of alliances with other groups and burning its enemies\u2019 bodies in diesel-fueled fires.\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-mexico-zetas-kingpins-arrest-is-display-of-new-restrained-style-in-drug-war/2013/07/16/5641c20a-ee32-11e2-bb32-725c8351a69e_story.html\" target=_blank>Miguel \u00c1ngel Morales</a>, in his early 50s, started out as a local gangster in the border town of Nuevo Laredo before joining the Zetas. He was known as Z-40. His younger brother, Omar, or Z-42, succeeded his brother as the Zetas leader following his arrest. Omar was himself detained in 2015.\nTrump had initially said the penalties on Mexico and Canada would take effect in early February unless those countries drastically curbed the flow of migrants and illegal fentanyl over their borders with the United States. Mexico won a temporary reprieve by sending 10,000 extra National Guard forces to the border. But Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning that <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114076153524132682\" target=_blank>he intended to go ahead with the sanctions</a>.\n\u201cDrugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\u201d he wrote.\nFentanyl has set off the deadliest drug epidemic in U.S. history. But deaths from overdoses, and quantities of the opioid seized in the United States, have declined over the past year, officials say.\n<i>Valentina Mu\u00f1oz Castillo and Gabriela Martinez contributed to this report.</i>"

Defense Department employees were given similar instructions to not respond, as were FBI personnel<b> </b>and Department of Homeland Security employees.\nThe latest directives<b> </b>come as employees and leaders alike across the government were caught off guard by an email sent Saturday titled: \u201cWhat did you do last week?\u201d\nIt commanded federal employees to \u201creply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,\u201d according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. It gave employees a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time Monday.\nThe email left many worried, others defiant and still others stunned. The resistance, which grew throughout the weekend, came even from some top administration officials selected by President Donald Trump.\nEmployees at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency were told definitively to reply \u2014 a few hours before DHS sent a note saying the opposite. In some parts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, staffers received instructions to draft a response but not send it yet. At other agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, employees were first given one instruction only to be emailed later to pause and watch for more guidance Monday.\nRaising the stakes, Musk warned in a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893386883444437415\">post on X</a> that any employee who failed to respond would be treated as having resigned. But the email sent to workers made no mention of that possible consequence, which lawyers said would be illegal.\nMusk\u2019s threat also appears to contradict an <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/media/kfpozkad/gwes-pia.pdf\" target=_blank>assessment released on Feb. 5</a> by the Office of Personnel Management that concluded that any responses to government-wide emails must be \u201cexplicitly voluntary.\u201d Yet the weekend email was sent by an address at OPM, which serves as human resources for the entire federal government \u2014 and has been largely taken over by Musk\u2019s U.S. DOGE Service.\nOn Sunday, a Republican lawmaker questioned the viability of the directive.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how that\u2019s necessarily feasible,\u201d Rep. Michael Lawler (New York) said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cObviously, a lot of federal employees are under union contract.\u201d\nMany employees at certain agencies cannot disclose information about their work to third parties without explicit authorization, security experts noted. Some warned of security risks if all 2.3 million federal employees are forced to reply to one email server sharing their contact information, their manager\u2019s contact information and details about the work they do.\nWorries at intelligence agencies\nConcerns ran especially deep among employees of the Defense Department, intelligence agencies and the military, according to messages and interviews with more than 300 federal employees.\n\u201cEven if people don\u2019t send classified information, the aggregation of all this information in one place would become classified information, which is a national security violation,\u201d warned one active-duty military officer who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. \u201cThe military cannot function without the DOD federal workforce. This is a national security issue to treat the workforce this way.\u201d\nAt the Justice Department, managers were advised late Saturday evening that all employees should be prepared to submit responses to the email on Monday. But rank-and-file FBI employees and staff in at least three U.S. attorney\u2019s offices across the country said Sunday that the last guidance they received from their direct managers was not to reply to the email before receiving further instructions.\nIn a bureau-wide communication Saturday evening, newly installed FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI would \u201cconduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures.\u201d\nAt the Secret Service, the OPM email prompted a flurry of texts and emails to supervisors among agents and officers about whether they were expected to reveal the sensitive and classified details of their job duties the previous week, according to two people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal communications.\nTo prevent agents from having to describe classified tasks they perform to protect the president and other high-ranking officials, senior officials initially instructed their subordinate agents to send an example response, beginning with: \u201cThis week I accomplished: 100% of the tasks and duties required of me by my position description\u201d and \u201c100% of the work product that my manager and I have agreed to.\u201d\nThe fifth and final bullet said: \u201cI exceeded expectations in the delivery of the above.\u201d\nOn online forums, many employees cheered the boilerplate language, before DHS told staff early Sunday evening that no one should respond, including those in component offices such as the Secret Service.\n\nAt the State Department, Tibor P. Nagy, acting undersecretary of state for management, said in a message obtained by The Post the department \u201cwill respond on behalf of the Department,\u201d adding that \u201cno employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command.\u201d\nSimilar messages went out to employees at a division within the Air Force, the Defense Information Systems Agency and the National Science Foundation, where the chief management officer said in a note to employees that the NSF did not receive advanced notice or guidance about the email.\nMusk stands firm, as directive costs workers time\nOn Saturday night and throughout Sunday, Musk doubled down on the directive. On X, the social media platform he owns, he stated that the email was necessary to ferret out government employees who are \u201cdoing so little work that they are not checking their email.\u201d He claimed, without evidence, that there were \u201cnon-existent people or the identities of dead people\u201d pretending to be government workers. Many Republican lawmakers defended the message, arguing it would only take a few minutes to reply.\nBut it caused uncertainty \u2014 and ate up people\u2019s time across the government. In the Air Force department, for example, some supervisors spent their Sundays phoning or texting each one of their subordinates to ensure they had seen both Musk\u2019s email and later guidance saying not to reply to it, according to several employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\nThe chaos extended beyond the executive branch. At the Library of Congress, which is part of the separate legislative branch, staff received an email Sunday afternoon saying the OPM note was not meant for them and they should not respond.\nSome judges and judiciary staff, who are also not in the executive branch, also received the OPM email, according to a note obtained by The Post from the director\u2019s office of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which staffs the judiciary branch. The message said no action should be taken and that the office would contact OPM about the Musk email.\nOther workers and agencies were unsure if the email was real, given its unorthodox timing.\n\u201cIt is possible that this new message sent outside of normal business hours was sent in error and/or is a phishing attempt,\u201d said an email to some staff from NOAA leadership. \u201cUntil such time as we can verify that the message that was received \u2026 is authentic, please do not respond.\u201d\nThe email also prompted defiance from Democrats and angry workers exhausted by Musk\u2019s efforts.\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) said in a statement Sunday that Democrats would block Musk in Congress and the courts.\n\u201cElon Musk is traumatizing hardworking federal employees, their children and families,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cHe has no legal authority to make his latest demands.\u201d\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) called the request \u201cabsurd\u201d and defended government employees. \u201cIf Elon Musk truly wants to understand what federal workers accomplished over the past week, he should get to know each department and agency, and learn about the jobs he\u2019s trying to cut.\u201d\nAt least one staffer responded to the email with resistance. A worker with the U.S. Geological Survey forwarded the \u201cWhat did you do last week?\u201d email to his direct supervisors informing them he \u201ccategorically\u201d refused to reply.\n\u201cThere is no way that a team of people will read &gt;2 million responses to this message,\u201d the employee wrote. \u201cAnyone who replies is likely to have their responses fed into some AI woodchipper and used for goodness knows what purpose, legal or illegal.\u201d\nHe then urged his bosses to defend their employees and \u201cpush back on these efforts to harass and intimidate us. We are all watching to see whose side you are on.\u201d\nLeaders within a NASA directorate advertised the email as a chance to tout workers\u2019 accomplishments, writing that employees should reply with speed, accuracy and detail.\n\u201cIn just the next two weeks we have 4 launches and 2 lunar landings with missions that will expand our understanding of the first stages of the Universe,\u201d the NASA email stated. \u201cEvery one of you play key roles in these momentous endeavors \u2026 and can supply many more than just 5 accomplishments in any given week to showcase our mission.\u201d\nBut at almost the same time elsewhere within NASA, another group of employees received opposite instructions.\nOne director wrote, \u201cI recognize there are many concerns already being elevated around the request [including] data that would be sent un-encrypted. \u2026 The agency is asking employees to take a pause and wait for additional communication and guidance.\u201d\nAnd on Sunday morning, the NASA directorate that had urged employees to reply reversed its guidance. \u201cPlease go ahead and prepare your bullets but do not submit \u2026 until you receive further guidance,\u201d a leader there wrote.\n\n<i>Ellen Nakashima, John Hudson, Mariana Alfaro, Warren Strobel, Derek Hawkins, Spencer S.

        "headline": "Supreme Court grants Trump request to pause USAID payments order",
        "content": "Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. granted the Trump administration\u2019s request late Wednesday to pause a lower court\u2019s midnight deadline for the government to resume nearly $2 billion in foreign aid payments suspended for weeks.\nThe brief administrative order, which did not address the underlying legal issues, will allow time for a full Supreme Court review.\nU.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali had given the administration until 11:59 p.m. to fulfill its contractual obligations and restart the payments to organizations whose work in impoverished parts of the world had been stopped since President Donald Trump halted such foreign assistance in late January.\nActing solicitor general Sarah M. Harris, the government\u2019s top appellate lawyer, had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25546029-24a831/\" target=_blank>asked the Supreme Court to block Ali\u2019s order</a>, which she said had \u201cthrown what should be an orderly review by the government into chaos.\u201d\nThe lower-court order, Harris wrote, exceeds the judiciary\u2019s authority. The government is \u201ccommitted to paying legitimate claims for work that was properly completed,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat the government cannot do is pay arbitrarily determined demands on an arbitrary timeline of the district court\u2019s choosing.\u201d\nRoberts gave the global aid organizations challenging the administration\u2019s actions until noon Friday to respond to those assertions.\nThe request to the Supreme Court marked the second time the new administration has asked the justices to intervene after a lower-court judge blocked Trump\u2019s efforts to reshape the federal government. Last week, the high court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/21/trump-dellinger-fire-supreme-court/\" target=_blank>refused to immediately clear the way</a> for the removal of Hampton Dellinger, the head of an independent watchdog agency, whom Trump tried to fire.\nTrump issued the wide-ranging pause on foreign aid shortly after his inauguration. His allies quickly began dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, the $40 billion arm of the government that assists humanitarian work in more than 100 countries. The moves <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">left millions of people at risk of hunger and illness</a> and thousands of USAID employees without jobs, some stranded in dangerous places around the world.\nTwo groups \u2014 the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council \u2014 filed suit. On Feb. 13, Ali, a Biden appointee who has been on the bench only since December, issued a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/14/usaid-trump-farmers-food-for-peace-kansas/\" target=_blank>temporary restraining order</a> prohibiting the administration from stopping the aid payments.\nBut in the days that followed, advocates alleged in court, administration officials openly defied the order, continued to lay off thousands of staffers and contractors, and started terminating thousands of grants that did not fit the administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio had earlier exempted some of the relief programs from the pause for work deemed \u201clifesaving.\u201d But a key payment system has remained largely offline, which has left aid partners without enough cash to continue their work and stranded thousands of pounds of food and medicine far from the communities desperate for help.\nOn Tuesday, Ali gave officials his deadline for restarting payments. The Trump administration immediately appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, saying that disbursing nearly $2 billion payments would take weeks.\nThree hours before Ali\u2019s deadline, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit<a href=\"https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/orders/docs/2025/02/25-5046LDSD.pdf\" target=_blank> turned away</a> the administration\u2019s request, saying it does not have the right to appeal at this early stage of the litigation before the U.S. district judge has finished his work.\nAt that point, the solicitor general\u2019s office had already asked the Supreme Court to intervene.\nHarris told the justices that the government cannot function and the president cannot carry out his duties over foreign affairs if \u201ca district court can appoint itself the claims-processor for the federal government and second-guess the Executive Branch\u2019s determinations.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the plaintiffs alleged that a small number of Trump\u2019s political appointees, acting at the direction of Trump adviser Elon Musk, were refusing to authorize or vetoing the back payments to foreign aid.\nA Trump administration official said via email Wednesday evening that the State Department and USAID had just completed a review of its programming, identifying nearly $4.4 billion in grants for elimination. Nearly 5,800 awards were targeted for elimination as part of \u201cthe America First agenda,\u201d the official said.\nUSAID retained critical awards, including food assistance, lifesaving medical treatments for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, and support for nations like Lebanon, Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba, the official said.\nThe review had been ongoing when Ali \u201cintervened\u201d in the process, the official added, and the State Department and USAID moved \u201crapidly to complete the programmatic evaluation,\u201d lifting stop-work orders for some programs and terminating others.\nAid groups and contractors told The Washington Post on Wednesday that they were receiving government notices of thousands of aid projects being terminated, despite the federal judge\u2019s ruling that foreign assistance should continue.\n<i>John Hudson contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "The Trump White House<b> </b>and Treasury Department officials have agreed to prohibit the U.S. DOGE Service from accessing personal taxpayer data, according to two people familiar with the arrangement, heading off a brewing privacy<b> </b>crisis at the tax agency.\nGavin Kliger, a software engineer with Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE effort assigned to the IRS, will have read-only access to anonymized tax data, the same access granted to academic researchers and IT professionals who work on IRS systems, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details of the agreement.\nDOGE, which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, over the weekend requested broad access to the most sensitive IRS data systems, which would have given Kliger the ability to see and in some cases edit detailed information \u2014 including bank accounts, payment balances, Social Security and other personal identification numbers and, in some instances, medical information \u2014 on virtually every individual, business and nonprofit in the country.\nWhite House officials argued that access was necessary to fulfill DOGE\u2019s charge of rooting out government waste. But that information is some of the most heavily guarded data in the federal government. Political officials do not have access to the Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS. The IRS\u2019s commissioner, national taxpayer advocate and even senior officials in the office of the chief information officer do not have IDRS access either.\nThe IRS was prepared to reject the White House\u2019s request, the people said, on the grounds that allowing DOGE to have the information would put millions of taxpayers\u2019 information at risk. But over the course of the week, Treasury officials recognized the broad nature of DOGE\u2019s request and agreed to limit Kliger\u2019s access, the people said.\nRepresentatives for the White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nDOGE has sought entry to several highly sensitive data systems across the government. The group sought access to the Treasury Department\u2019s payment systems; the career official who was in charge of that program resigned rather than grant the request. He was later replaced by a DOGE staffer on assignment to Treasury.\nDOGE is also attempting to gain access to Social Security Administration datasets, which include the world\u2019s largest repository of medical data and years of history on social safety net payments and employment histories. The acting Social Security administrator resigned late last week after clashing with DOGE officials over that request."
