"Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem signaled Wednesday morning that the Trump administration is considering using the Guantánamo Bay detention camp to house undocumented immigrants whom officials are seeking to deport.
Asked directly whether Guantánamo Bay was an option for sending undocumented immigrants apprehended by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Noem told Fox News’s “Fox &amp; Friends” that President Donald Trump and his administration are looking at all their options for expelling people who are in the United States illegally, particularly those from countries that do not currently accept deportees, such as Venezuela and Cuba.
“We’re evaluating and talking about that right now. It’s the president’s decision, but it’s an asset, and we’re going to continue to look at how we can use all of our assets to keep America safe,” Noem said.
Guantánamo Bay is known for its military prison within the naval base on the coast of Cuba, where suspected terrorists have been held in the years since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It also has a separate migrant processing facility, which the Biden administration used to process some asylum seekers.",Noem: Guantánamo Bay on the table to house deportees,"[PASS] (1.00)

"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to visit the naval base at Guantánamo Bay as soon as Wednesday as the Trump administration’s effort to detain migrants there continues to take shape, two military officials familiar with that matter said.
The trip will come after the Trump administration dispatched hundreds of U.S. Marines to the installation to assist in an operation detaining what Hegseth has called “high-threat” migrants due for deportation. Administration officials, seeking to project strength, put them in a prison at Guantánamo Bay that has been used to house suspected terrorists after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, saying that an initial wave was all from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
Hegseth is expected to highlight the mission and how it is taking shape, said the military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

"Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO and top ally of President Donald Trump, is casting doubt on the funding source for a massive artificial intelligence project that Trump announced Tuesday.

"NEW YORK — Mayor Eric Adams’s attorney argued Wednesday that the case against him should be dismissed permanently, alleging that leaks of a former top prosecutor’s resignation letter discussing the indictment prevented any future fair trial.
The motion filed by Adams lawyer Alex Spiro argued that the mayor’s right to a fair trial was tainted by former acting U.S. attorney Danielle Sassoon’s leaked Feb. 12 letter that said the case was strong and that her office was prepared to file additional charges for obstruction.
Sassoon also said she believed a quid pro quo existed between a top figure at the Justice Department and Adams, and that the mayor committed to help with President Donald Trump’s immigration efforts in exchange for seeing his case dismissed.
Adams and the Justice Department have denied a quid quo pro exists, but the ordeal and the government’s decision to abandon the public corruption matter have drawn an immense amount of controversy.
Acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove argued in court last week without offering proof that the case was politically motivated and would interfere with the 2025 mayoral election. Bove asked Judge Dale Ho to dismiss the case “without prejudice,” which would leave open a possible future revival of the matter.
Spiro argued in his letter to Ho on Wednesday that the case should be dismissed “with prejudice” instead, because “the government’s conduct has destroyed whatever presumption of innocence Mayor Adams had left.”
Ho cannot ultimately deny Bove’s request, but he did not immediately toss the case. He instead assigned an independent lawyer to evaluate arguments against the government’s dismissal request.",N.Y. Mayor Eric Adams pushes for permanent dismissal of his corruption case,"[PASS] (1.00)

"As GOP lawmakers in Washington try to protect a key food aid program from the Trump administration’s cutbacks, international humanitarian organizations say the ongoing disruptions<b> </b>in assistance are devastating countries that are on the verge of famine.
The administration’s move in late January to gut the U.S. Agency for International Development — <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/01/foreign-aid-freeze-state-department-usaid/"" target=_blank>laying off thousands of workers</a> and freezing funding<b> </b>in more than 100 countries — immediately jeopardized Food for Peace. For more than 70 years, the $2 billion program has purchased surplus commodities from American farmers for distribution overseas.
Late Thursday, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered administration officials to temporarily lift their freeze on U.S. aid and development programs abroad. He alluded to the “shockwave” caused by their action and said they “have not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid … was a rational precursor to reviewing programs.”
President Donald Trump and top adviser Elon Musk, a tech billionaire, have been highly critical of USAID’s work, with Trump baselessly claiming the agency had committed “tremendous fraud.” 
Despite a State Department waiver for emergency food assistance, those shipments still had been delayed around the world, a USAID inspector general wrote in a report Monday — <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/11/trump-fires-usaid-inspector-general/"" target=_blank>a day before he was dismissed</a>. The bottleneck, Paul K. Martin wrote, put more than $489 million in food assistance at risk of spoilage or theft as it waited at ports, in transit and in warehouses.
In defending itself in court, Ali noted, the government acknowledged that the waiver process “may have had ‘hiccups.’”
Aid groups had said Thursday that some food deliveries were starting to move through shipping channels but that millions more pounds of corn, lentils and pinto beans remained stuck because the agency’s payment system was not functioning.
The waiver for lifesaving assistance that was in place before the judge’s order was “theoretical” because “the payment system that reimburses partners for expenses they incur is offline,” said Sarah Charles, former head of USAID’s Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, which oversaw the Food for Peace program. Some relief agencies are still owed for services rendered in December and January, she added.
At a contentious meeting at the State Department, the Trump appointee tasked with overseeing USAID — or what is left of it — had assured aid workers and congressional staff that aid payments would resume early next week. But Peter Marocco also said that a department review of the agency’s remaining projects was underway and that those that do not “give the president real influence” will be cut, according to a readout of the event obtained by The Washington Post.
A department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Complicating the administration’s narrative is a growing tide of Republican lawmakers and former officials who say it’s not quite accurate.
Andrew Natsios, who served as USAID administrator during the George W. Bush administration, told lawmakers this week that even those relief organizations already granted waivers haven’t been able to “issue checks” and keep working because of the shutdown of USAID’s payment system.
That includes Christian humanitarian groups, which receive $1 billion a year, Natsios said at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing<b> </b>Thursday. The session was meant to highlight what Trump and his allies say is USAID’s wasteful spending but instead underscored concerns about the flow of critical assistance, as two of the three expert witnesses warned of dire consequences for U.S. interests and national security if the aid did not resume soon.
Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), who has urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “quickly ship and distribute” the American-grown food assistance, is among those questioning what’s happening on the ground.
Moran said the State Department last weekend had notified participating groups that they could restart operations. He is skeptical that there has been much impact so far. “My impression is that waivers were granted, but then it doesn’t seem like it was making a significant difference,” he told The Post.

He is working with Rep. Tracey Mann (R), a fellow Kansan, and other lawmakers to protect Food for Peace by moving it to the U.S. Department of Agriculture as “part of an ongoing effort to save money and increase efficiency,” Moran said in a statement. That proposal has gained widespread support from agricultural groups.
Founded in Kansas, Food for Peace was signed into law in 1954 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It has long been championed by the state’s leaders, including former senator Robert J. Dole, and has helped more than 4 billion people in over 150 countries since its inception.
The program is a source of pride for farmers. But it has been criticized over the years for various issues, including the potential to undermine local agriculture in recipient countries and exacerbate conflicts in war-torn areas, according to Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute.
Even if the lawmakers prevail, the program’s ultimate survival is not guaranteed.
Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, pointed to the USDA’s new secretary. Brooke Rollins, former head of a conservative Texas think tank, was confirmed Thursday.
“What happens if she goes into this office cleaning house?” Levendofsky asked. “And what about when Elon Musk comes over to USDA? Anything is to be expected at this point.”
Kansas is the country’s biggest grower of sorghum, and millions of bushels of the high-protein grain are backed up in warehouses across the state. Kim Barnes, chief financial officer of the Pawnee County Cooperative Association, a grain trader in central Kansas, said he’s storing more than 1.3 million bushels of sorghum because of a market downturn over the last year — a situation that will only worsen with USAID cutbacks.
It’s a shame, he said, adding: “There are still countries that need it.”
On Thursday, a different federal judge <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/13/usaid-workers-trump-leave-ruling/"" target=_blank>extended a block</a> on the Trump administration’s plan to place thousands of USAID employees on leave. But with thousands of contractors already<i><b> </b></i>fired, the agency’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance could ultimately lose more than 90 percent of its workforce, Martin, the inspector general, wrote. That outcome exacerbates concerns about whether any existing staff can work with locals on the ground to distribute the commodities, he added.
The <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/"" target=""_blank"">temporary gap in supplies has been “devastating”</a> some countries, said Paul Spiegel, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health and former chief of public health in the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
“There has already been much damage done that will be difficult to undo,” Spiegel said Friday. “The administration has not always done what they said they would do providing exceptions for humanitarian response, so the question remains: Will they allow funds to go out, or will they simply slow it down and the pain and suffering of all these vulnerable people around the globe will continue?”
Duaa Tarig, who worked as an art curator in Sudan before war broke out, said she personally knew three people who recently died of malnutrition in her Khartoum neighborhood.
The pattern is familiar. During a 10-day period last year, many died when soup kitchens in the city were forced to shutter for lack of funding, she recounted. Weakened by starvation, individuals succumbed quickly to malaria or dengue fever.
With USAID funding curtailed, more than 80 percent of those soup kitchens have closed again, she said. Many of those remaining open are unable to afford the lentils they usually buy and are scraping together vegetable soups.
“Everyone, including myself, have lost a lot of weight. Some have lost more than half their body weight. I see the faces of people I used to know and I can’t recognize them — they are just bone and skin,” she said.

"The notices popped into email boxes all over the country Monday afternoon, notifying researchers who collect, analyze and study data on the American education system that their contracts were terminated, effective immediately. No reason was given.
The nixed contracts support the Institute for Education Sciences at the Education Department, known as IES,<b> </b>and inside the agency, staff questioned whether the cuts were legal, much less justified.
But the decisions were not made by the institute’s leaders or education experts. Rather, the canceled contracts were all on a list drawn up by a U.S. DOGE Service team that is working to unravel the Education Department, stripping the agency of staff, terminating contracts and — soon — canceling program grants, according to people familiar with DOGE activity who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs.
“We’re completely crippled,” said one IES employee. “It really prevents us from serving the mission we thought we were carrying out.”
President Donald Trump has made clear he <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/"">wants the Education Department shuttered</a>. Absent congressional action to do that, his administration is at work dismantling it on its own.
On Wednesday, at least 50 recently hired employees who were on probation were abruptly dismissed without cause across the department, according to union leaders. Staff have been warned that layoffs are coming. And managers inside the agency have been instructed to identify workers who can be converted to a new job status that would strip them of some worker protections, according to a person with direct knowledge of the order.
In addition, DOGE caused about 100 Education Department employees to be put on administrative leave for their <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/10/education-department-dei-devos/"">mostly tangential</a> connections to diversity, equity and inclusion<b> </b>programs, based on <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/22/dei-federal-employees-trump/"">Trump’s executive order</a> to rid the federal government of DEI offices and initiatives. And in <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/"">an executive order</a> Tuesday, Trump instructed departments heads across the government to hire no more than one employee for every four employees who depart, and to plan for mass layoffs.
“The inmates are running the asylum, and the goal is chaos and the goal is destruction,” Arne Duncan, who served as education secretary in the Obama administration, said in an interview. “We’ve never seen anything like this in our lifetime.”
On Friday, the department announced another round of cancellations: $336 million in canceled contracts for Regional Educational Laboratories, which help states apply evidence-based practices to teaching and that <a href=""https://www.the74million.org/article/from-covid-learning-loss-to-artificial-intelligence-education-rd-cant-wait/"" target=""_blank"">have been praised</a> by the former Tennessee schools chief who Trump nominated as deputy secretary of education.
The cancellation of contracts began at IES, but is expected to extend to other parts of the department. A department spokeswoman, Madi Biedermann, said earlier this week that 89 contracts worth nearly $900 million had been canceled at IES — not counting the new crop canceled on Friday.
Other officials said the total number was 167 or 169. It’s not clear what accounted for the discrepancy. IES has a small full-time staff; most of its work is<b> </b>contracted out.
It’s also not clear<b> </b>whether the savings are as deep as the<b> </b>department said.
Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, pulled data on the canceled contracts that suggested DOGE overstated the cost of some of them. He also found that, in many cases, contractors are already several years into their agreements, so a lot of the money has been spent already. His preliminary calculations show that the actual savings may be half as much as DOGE claims, or less.
Malkus’s concern is that agreements were canceled without careful consideration, and for less of a benefit than advertised.
“There’s a lot of bloat in IES. There’s a lot of problems to be solved,” he said. “These are problems you solve with a scalpel and maybe a hatchet, but not a bulldozer.”
‘Complete confusion’
The “bulldozer” arrived at IES on Monday, when a young representative of DOGE delivered the list of contracts to be terminated to the department’s acting director. Soon after, a flurry of emergency meetings began, first with managers and then with rank-and-file employees, announcing that the contracts were being canceled, effective immediately.
There were no reasons given for the cuts, attendees said, except that DOGE wanted them. The mood was somber, with some holding back tears, staffers said. Confused IES employees asked repeatedly about the legality of DOGE’s actions, but they didn’t get an answer.
Meantime, on the outside, texts, emails and calls were bouncing among researchers and contractors as word spread of canceled contracts. The feeling was utter shock and “complete confusion,” said Rachel Dinkes, president and CEO of Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education research groups.
Inside and outside the department, those close to IES research said they<b> </b>were unsettled by the youth and inexperience of DOGE representatives recommending the cancellations, as well as what seemed to be a lack of understanding of the complex, interdependent ecosystem of contracts maintained by IES.
For instance, one canceled contract was for work on the Common Core of Data, the primary database of all K-12 schools in the United States. It includes data on enrollment, demographics and other information about students and teachers, and is used by researchers, government agencies and others for a wide range of reasons. It is, said Dinkes, the “backbone” of knowledge about American education and needed for virtually any effort to compare and analyze schools.
Contracts for the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/01/29/nations-report-card-naep-test-scores-fall/"">National Assessment of Educational Progress</a>, or NAEP, exams were not canceled. But Dinkes and others said that NAEP relies on the Common Core of Data when it creates the sample<b> </b>of schools to administer tests. So running the testing program, sometimes called the Nation’s Report Card, will be harder without the Common Core of Data, she said.
In another example, DOGE killed a contract for interpreting data IES collects from colleges and universities tracking enrollment and financial aid. The raw data will still be gathered, but the studies that made sense of it for the public are gone. That will make it harder to understand how students are using financial aid, staffers said, and to identify barriers to higher education.
“Sure, you have the raw data that scientists can fiddle with, but the necessary step of digesting that in ways that answer questions, it’s gone,” a staffer said. “Now you need a PhD to make any sense of it.”
DOGE also canceled contracts IES maintained to publish practice guides for students and schools on topics including how to prepare for college, how to succeed in high school, how to become literate in STEM — and, for educators, how to solve attendance problems. The guides were the most popular product IES publishes, staffers said.

In other cases, contracts were for programs that are designed to test the most effective way to solve a problem within the education system. For instance, one contractor was running a study looking at how best to accelerate math learning, Dinkes said. She said the study involved giving half of a group of students<b> </b>one type of instruction and the other half another. The goal was to see which teaching method produced better math results.
But the experiment was abruptly terminated this week when the contract was canceled, she said, and the students are no longer getting either of the math interventions.
Before the cuts, some employees tried to lay out these complexities for DOGE representatives, a staffer said. Some contracts were expendable, they suggested, but others were not. But the employees were unable to sway DOGE team.
“They’ve effectively dismantled us,” said one staffer.
“We’re completely crippled,” said another.
In addition, many of the canceled contracts were nearing the end of multiyear projects, so terminating them meant time, effort and money already expended may go to waste.
“Canceling them now yields the taxpayers no return on their investment,” said a statement from American Institutes for Research, which had 15 IES contracts worth more than $180 million, according to DOGE’s list, which was obtained by The Washington Post. “This is an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.”
Biedermann, the department spokeswoman, said the contracts were costing more than they were worth. But she said she didn’t know<b> </b>how or why DOGE reached that conclusion. “The significant amount of money as compared to the outcomes generated for students is not commensurate,” she said.
Asked how DOGE workers have the requisite expertise to make these determinations, she said, “The entire goal of DOGE is to cut waste, and they have been trained to identify that.”
Contracts that can be justified or that are congressionally mandated will be rebid, which can be a lengthy process, officials said.
The cancellations hung over the confirmation hearing Thursday for Linda McMahon, Trump’s nominee for Education secretary, with several Democrat senators pressing her on what was going on inside the agency.
Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Massachusetts) said DOGE rightfully stands for the “Department of Gutting Education.”
“We know that’s just a down payment to gut the education of every public school student in America,” he said. “First they announce the cuts. Then they go to find where it is. So it’s all backwards.”
Grants on the chopping block
Staff at the Education Department<b> </b>are now bracing for the next round of cuts, they said, including more grant cancellations.
Most of the money that Education sends to schools is distributed by a formula, but more than $7 billion is given through competitive grant programs, such as one that pays for after school programs and another that supports charter schools.
Last week, staffers were directed to review all grants that have “illegal DEI in them,” another employee said. On Monday, a DOGE account on X <a href=""https://x.com/DOGE/status/1889105335991820585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1889105335991820585%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"">said</a> that it had terminated 29 “DEI training grants” at the Education Department totaling $101 million.
Also on Monday, DOGE was given access to scour a database detailing all the department’s grants, said one person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private proceedings. “Grants will be [canceled] this week or early next,” the person predicted.
Then, on Friday, the department announced it was terminating $33 million in grants for Equity Assistance Centers, a program created to support school desegregation but that the department said supports “divisive training.”
The DOGE team has also gained access to sensitive department data, including the personal information of millions of borrowers who’ve taken out federal student loans. That’s led to a 30-fold increase in complaints<b> </b>to a privacy office at the department, according to a person familiar with the situation.
Duncan, the former education secretary, said DOGE workers have no qualifications and no legal right to access Americans’ personal data. More important, he said, they have the wrong goals.
“All this sound and noise and drama and not one word about helping more kids learn to read,” he said. “Not even a mention.”","DOGE rips through Education Department, cutting contracts, staff and grants","[PASS] (1.00)

"President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Wednesday evening aimed at restricting undocumented immigrants’ access to financial benefits from federally funded programs, though they already are generally ineligible for most federal public benefits.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=""https://x.com/PressSec/status/1892350830969270572"" target=_blank>confirmed</a> Trump’s plans to sign the executive order on X, reposting a report from Fox News reporter Bill Melugin that said the order “will direct every federal agency &amp; department to identify all federally funded programs currently providing any financial benefits to illegal aliens, and ‘take corrective action.’”
The action, according to Melugin’s reporting, may be designed to target immigrants who are granted humanitarian parole by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

"A federal judge on Friday denied a request to temporarily ban employees working with the U.S. DOGE Service from accessing closely guarded systems inside the federal government that contain tax returns, Social Security numbers and reams of private data for millions of Americans.<b> </b>But another federal court’s <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/"" target=_blank>temporary ban remains in place for now</a>.
The lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Virginia by the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center and an anonymous federal worker is one of several seeking to block DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency, from getting ahold of records kept by the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which processes about $6 trillion a year in electronic payments to households, businesses and other recipients — and keeps vast stores of data on “virtually every single person in the country,” according to the plaintiffs.
Attorneys also asked the judge to block DOGE from accessing records maintained by the U.S.<b> </b>Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which detail the Social Security numbers, birth dates, salaries, home addresses and disciplinary histories of all federal workers and personal information for millions of applicants seeking government jobs. DOGE’s flurry of moves in the first month of the new presidential administration have sparked dozens of lawsuits across the country.
In a written opinion Friday, U.S. District Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr. said the nonprofit and the federal worker seeking a preliminary injunction had “not provided concrete evidence that Defendants are actively misusing or even attempting to misuse their sensitive data.”
A federal court in Manhattan already had imposed a temporary ban on DOGE access to Americans’ private data held by the Treasury, and other requests for temporary bans are pending before a federal judge in D.C. Alston was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term.
“Plaintiffs’ fears of future harm are much too speculative and would require the Court to make several leaps in reasoning in order to warrant injunctive relief,” Alston wrote.
John L. Davisson, director of litigation for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said at a hearing Friday that exposing millions of Americans’ private financial data in a “historically large and consequential breach” violated several federal laws and the Fifth Amendment, and could leave the United States more vulnerable to malign actors.
In one of his first executive orders last month, Trump charged DOGE and its de facto leader, billionaire Elon Musk, with modernizing government agencies and reviewing their functions. Justice Department attorneys said in a legal filing that the groups suing over DOGE’s moves were “seeking unprecedented judicial micromanagement of the Executive Branch’s ability to share government data with its own employees.”
Jonathan Lucier, an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, said at a court hearing Friday that the employees in question were all hired by Treasury and OPM or detailed to those agencies. Granting data access to in-house employees carrying out a presidential initiative “cannot be illegal,” Lucier argued.
Tom Krause, a tech company chief executive who briefly worked for DOGE, is now a senior Treasury adviser and the only liaison to the group. Justice Department attorneys said in court papers that he has never been given “direct access” to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service payment system, only “over-the-shoulder” access “to review activity others performed in the system or data others accessed from the system.”
But Justice Department attorneys acknowledged in a footnote that another employee who began working at DOGE and was then hired by Treasury, Marko Elez, did have access to the closely guarded payment system — which includes details of highly classified programs — until he resigned Feb. 6. He was found to have made racist statements on social media. Musk said he would rehire Elez, who now works at the Social Security Administration, <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/doge-staffer-behind-racist-posts-reappears-at-social-security?embedded-checkout=true"" target=_blank>according to Bloomberg News</a>.
In response to a lawsuit filed by 19 states, another federal court barred Krause from accessing Americans’ personal or financial information pending further legal proceedings. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in Manhattan found that the states would face irreparable harm without the temporary ban “because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.”
Another federal judge in Manhattan <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/"" target=_blank>issued a preliminary injunction</a> in that case Friday, prohibiting DOGE from accessing the Treasury data while the states’ lawsuit is pending. U.S. District Judge Jeannette A. Vargas said she could lift the ban if the Trump administration can show it is taking steps to safeguard the public’s most sensitive data.",Judge denies temporary ban on DOGE access to private data,"[PASS] (1.00)

"A federal judge on Thursday extended for seven days <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/07/federal-judge-blocks-trump-administration-putting-thousands-usaid-workers-leave/"" target=""_blank"">his temporary restraining order</a> on the Trump administration’s move to place about 2,100 employees from the U.S. Agency for International Development on paid leave, delaying any action while the judge weighs whether to order a longer pause.
Two labor unions representing USAID employees sued the Trump administration last week, saying the sudden halt to funding not only upended overseas aid programs but endangered some employees’ lives in various countries. U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, a Trump appointee, first entered a restraining order last week stopping the plan.
On Thursday, he told Justice Department employees to submit to him by Friday the steps it was taking to ensure overseas employees’ safety and to indicate whether it would cover employees’ other benefits, such as school or car payments, while they are on leave.
Nichols had set his original restraining order to expire at 11:59 p.m. Friday. He extended all the deadlines in the order by one week, while he drafts an opinion on whether to enjoin the spending shutdowns throughout the litigation. He amended the order to ban involuntary evacuations of USAID workers overseas, but not voluntary ones.
Lawyers on both sides were not fully clear last week how many USAID workers were affected. The government said in an affidavit that 2,140 employees had been placed on paid leave as of Feb. 7, replacing the 2,700 figure used in last week’s hearing. The government said 98 percent of those placed on leave were stationed in the United States. The unions said Thursday USAID employs about 4,700 people, and about 1,400 live abroad.
The Trump administration has argued that it was merely pausing USAID spending while it examines whether the agency is pursuing Trump’s agenda, and that some top aides were ousted for refusing directions to immediately stop funding. The employees’ union said the pause has already damaged aid programs around the world and possibly placed employees in danger by not paying for their cellphones, internet or other security measures.
The suit marks the first major legal challenge to the push by President Donald Trump and his allies, led by billionaire Elon Musk and his U.S. DOGE Service, or Department of Government Efficiency, targeting foreign aid programs and USAID staff as part of their campaign<b> </b>to reshape the federal government. The lawsuit is one of several <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/06/trump-resistance-courts-democrats-musk/"" target=_blank>legal challenges mounted by Trump opponents</a> seeking to<b> </b>slow or halt the administration’s barrage of actions to curtail spending, pare back the administrative state, eradicate diversity initiatives and more.
The judge’s extension comes as the Trump administration grows increasingly defensive of the chaos caused by the halt in aid projects around the world.
On Thursday, the Trump administration sent an internal memo to USAID employees threatening to fire them if they communicated with the press about continued disruptions to foreign aid despite Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s issuing an exemption for “lifesaving humanitarian assistance” last month.
“﻿The purpose of this memo is to correct a false narrative in the press, and provide clarity for staff on external communications,” wrote USAID official Mark Lloyd to staff in a memo obtained by The Washington Post.
Rubio’s exemption “has continued uninterrupted and was never paused,” Lloyd added. “Unauthorized engagement externally with the press or others is subject to discipline, including dismissal.”
Leading aid groups say even when they’ve obtained exemptions, they cannot continue their work because Rubio’s “stop work” order has effectively shut down payment systems required to draw down funds. That has resulted in thousands of aid workers and USAID contractors being furloughed, disrupting projects from Asia to Africa to Latin America.
USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.
In another move this week, the White House fired the inspector general for USAID on Tuesday after he released a blistering report saying $489 million in food assistance was at risk of spoilage or potential diversion because of the funding freeze and work stoppage.
The Trump administration is “engaged in a wholesale and rapid campaign to dissolve the USAID in its entirety,” said attorney Karla Gilbride, representing both the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees. “That campaign has begun with the freezing of all funding on USAID projects.”
Nichols immediately interjected, saying, “As I understand it, all funding on all projects is not frozen.”
Gilbride said the government’s claims do “not match the reality on the ground,” in which bills are not being paid and employees are operating in an information vacuum as USAID leadership in Washington is upended. “It is not consistent with the declaration that this is just a ‘pencils down’ pause. Which is what a 90-day review suggested.”
The unions have argued that USAID is a body created by Congress, and a law passed last year requires the president to notify and consult Congress if it intends to “reorganize or redesign, eliminate, consolidate or downsize any agency,” Gilbride said.
“It’s necessary that the court impose the injunction and extend the temporary order so that the situation doesn’t get worse,” Gilbride said.
With a preliminary injunction, Nichols would not be making a final judgment on whether the USAID moves are legal. For now, he must decide whether irreparable harm will be caused if he doesn’t issue the injunction while also considering the likelihood of whether the employees will prevail on the larger question.
Nichols seemed particularly concerned by a “clearly harrowing situation” in Democratic Republic of Congo, where USAID staff in Kinshasa had to evacuate due to civil unrest there but couldn’t obtain any funds from Washington to do so, and wound up crossing the Congo River in small boats, leaving their homes and belongings behind.
Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton said the Trump administration was “committed to every USAID employee’s security, and everyone will be kept safe.”
Hamilton said the Justice Department believes Trump acted within his authority under Article II of the Constitution, and “Eight foreign aid statutes recognize the need for presidential direction in this space. We think it’s consistent with all of those authorities, that the president when he comes into office, on the first day to take brief stock to see that foreign aid is only let out consistent with his policy.”
Hamilton added: “We don’t think a reorganization has happened. It’s a 90-day pause.” But he noted Rubio did send a letter to Congress on Feb. 3 notifying them of the move.
“That notice checks the box,” Hamilton said of the requirement for the president to consult with Congress before remaking an agency. “We think the specifics of that consultation would be a political question.”
Nichols raised the issue of whether the employees’ complaints of mistreatment should be heard by a civil service board, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board, rather than a court. Harrison agreed. “The only thing that’s changing is whether they’re doing work and having access to systems,” Harrison said. “This makes this very much a personnel dispute, not appropriate for federal district court.”
Gilbride responded that going through civil service appeals can “take years to reach a conclusion. By the time the MSPB process goes through, many years may have passed and there will no longer be a USAID for individuals to return to. … The unions that are in this case are not seeking damages or back pay on behalf of their members. What they’re seeking is that USAID not be unconstitutionally dissolved.”
The extension comes as former U.S. officials who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations have become increasingly vocal about the ramifications of USAID’s dismantling.
On Wednesday, more than 200 former officials wrote a letter to leaders of the House and Senate saying “the human suffering that these cutoffs have caused is catastrophic and heartbreaking.”
“In Kenya, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere, aid to survivors of torture was stopped in its tracks,” said the officials, who include Michael Hayden, who headed the National Security Agency during the Bush administration; former CIA officer Bruce Riedel; former Middle East adviser Aaron David Miller; former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch; and others.
“Children and adult victims of war and terror who have relied on the United States have been left without care. And in poorer countries around the world, thousands of women and girls will die in the next 90 days due to complications of childbirth that might otherwise have been avoided through interventions funded by Congress and administered by USAID,” they wrote in the letter, obtained by The Post.","Judge adds one-week pause on Trump plan to put 2,100 USAID workers on leave","[PASS] (1.00)

"The White House is preparing to issue a trio of executive orders on education, including one directing the Education Department to withhold federal funding from any school that teaches about “radical gender ideology” or “critical race theory,” officials said Wednesday.
The order instructs the secretary of education to present a strategy to achieve this within 90 days, according to a summary.
A second order promotes school choice options, including an attempt to help states use federal funding for private-school voucher programs. The third order seeks to combat antisemitism in schools.
For years, Republicans including President Donald Trump have attacked schools for teaching a basket of ideas about systemic racism labeled critical race theory. Trump has also attacked schools for policies and lessons that recognize and respect transgender students.
Federal law allows the agency to withhold federal funds from any school that discriminates based on race. Trump and his allies argue that lessons about systemic racism amount to discrimination, because they presume certain things about people based on race, such as that White Americans enjoy certain privileges based on their race. They say that giving rights to transgender students, especially transgender girls and women, discriminates against cisgender girls and women by forcing them to share spaces and sports teams.
The order also reinstates the<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/02/trump-1776-commission-education/"" target=_blank> 1776 Commission</a>, which Trump created just a week before the 2020 presidential election to promote “patriotic education.” The commission wrote a report that was published in the final days of his first term. The report came under heavy fire from historians as a distortion of American history, and President Joe Biden disbanded the panel as one of his first acts. As a candidate, Trump promised to reinstate the commission if reelected.

"A federal judge in D.C. on Thursday told the Trump administration it had failed to comply with his order to restart billions in foreign aid but stopped short of holding officials in contempt of court as plaintiffs in a pair of lawsuits had asked.
Earlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Amir H. Ali issued a temporary restraining order blocking the administration from putting a 90-day pause on foreign assistance. In Thursday’s ruling, he said the order “was clear,” but Trump officials had not followed it.
President Donald Trump placed the aid on hold as one of his first actions after taking office in January, saying the aid did not align with American interests or values.
Health organizations filed suit in response, claiming the Trump administration was endangering the lives of many around the world who relied on the assistance to combat HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. The money also went to other development projects.
After Ali issued his temporary restraining order, or TRO, requiring Trump officials to restart the aid on Feb. 13, the administration said it had authority under other statutes to continue much of the freeze. Ali rejected that idea Thursday.
“The TRO does not permit Defendants to simply search for and invoke new legal authorities as a post-hoc rationalization for the enjoined agency action,” Ali wrote.",Judge says Trump officials have not complied with order to restart foreign aid,"[PASS] (1.00)

"President Donald Trump’s plan to remove Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and create a real estate “riviera” on the eastern Mediterranean has spurred a regional scramble for an alternative, with Arab leaders working on a proposal that aims to pump billions of dollars in reconstruction money into the enclave, according to people familiar with the planning.
Leaders from Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar met in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Friday to thrash out details less than three weeks after Trump laid out a plan <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/trump-netanyahu-meeting/"" target=_blank>for the United States to “take over” Gaza</a> and displace the population there, a proposal that has been broadly condemned as tantamount to ethnic cleansing.
The emerging Arab plan would call for Palestinian technocrats to govern Gaza and the provision of substantial funds to rebuild the shattered enclave, where the vast majority of the population of 2 million has been left homeless, according to five people with knowledge of the discussions.
And while details of the plan are still being hashed out, they say there is resounding unanimity on one issue: Palestinians should not be displaced.
“The Trump proposal is so outlandish and offensive to many in the Middle East that certainly it’s a nonstarter. It’s a hot mess,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), who has discussed plans with regional leaders including Jordan’s King Abdullah II, whom Blumenthal met in the Jordanian Red Sea resort of Aqaba this week.
“The Arab plan will seek to present a realistic proposal for reconstruction in Gaza without forced evacuation and without a United States takeover,” Blumenthal said in a telephone interview.
The broad strokes of the Arab plan — hoped to be<b> </b>finalized ahead of an emergency summit with representatives of the broader 22-member Arab League on March 4 — are “becoming clearer,” Blumenthal said. But significant hurdles remain, including reaching Arab consensus and<b> </b>obtaining U.S. and Israeli buy-in, he added.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel is “committed” to Trump’s plan and described it as a “bold vision” for Gaza. The proposal has also received rapturous approval from the country’s far-right politicians, who have pushed for Israeli settlements in Gaza and the enclave’s annexation.
But Arab states are hoping to garner backing for their plan with their checkbooks. A new assessment by the United Nations estimates that it could cost $50 billion to rebuild Gaza after the devastation caused by 15 months of war.
The exact figure to be put forward is “still up for review,” but the proposal is likely to include a headline number, said Emirati academic Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a visiting fellow at Harvard University.
“The number is important because they know the president of the United States is transactional, he likes numbers, and they think he might be swayed when he sees these billions of dollars,” including construction opportunities for U.S. companies,<b> </b>he said.
Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said this week that regional construction firms, including those in Egypt, have the capacity to build 300,000 housing units over a three-year period.
Other proposals being considered appear aimed at keeping Trump’s interest in investment at the heart of Gaza’s future. One, from the Al Habtoor Group, an Emirati conglomerate, <a href=""https://www.alhabtoorgroup.com/gaza/Gaza-Reconstruction-Plan.pdf"" target=_blank>outlines a phased approach</a> that would establish security in the territory and transition emergency housing into redevelopment over 18 months.
Arab countries know they hold leverage by being “the ATMs” for reconstruction, said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. However, the “clash of worldviews,” between Israel and Trump on one side and the region on the other, remains a major sticking point, he said.
During his trip to Washington this month, Netanyahu looked on smiling as Trump outlined his plans for a U.S. “takeover” of Gaza. “The big impediment is if the whole exercise will be accepted by Trump, and certainly big questions over whether it will be accepted by the current Israeli government,” Katulis said of the Arab plan.
Phase one of the Arab plan envisages reconstruction in areas that have not been completely obliterated, but Arab leaders are willing to open their wallets only if other political and security elements of a plan are put in place, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who has recently met with ministers from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan to discuss evolving plans. “It’s a delicate balancing act because all these three pieces need to converge,” he said.
The technocratic committee envisioned for Gaza under the Arab plan would not include Hamas, the ruler of Gaza for almost two decades and architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.
“The two main driving principles on the governance side is that Hamas will have no governing role in Gaza, and also that it creates a political unity with the West Bank,” said Van Hollen, adding that Arab states want the Palestinian Authority, the governing entity in the West Bank, to have some degree of sign-off on the structure.
Arab leaders, like previous U.S. administrations, have long advocated a clear path to a two-state solution, which Netanyahu has repeatedly opposed, along with any rule by the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.
“Squaring that circle is a big challenge at this point,” Van Hollen said.
Two officials briefed on the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive proposals that are still in flux, emphasized that the technocratic government is intended to be a “temporary” body to oversee rebuilding and would remain in place only until elections could be held.
While many officials in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, and in Riyadh remain frustrated that they were not informed before Trump floated the Gaza displacement plan, they also acknowledge that the U.S. leader’s approach has succeeded in motivating the Arab states to act, according to the officials.
“Trump scrambled the table, and it forced other people to start doing some of the heavy lifting,” said one individual familiar with the thinking of the regional leadership. Others in the region draw parallels to Trump’s comments on Ukraine that spurred emergency meetings of leaders in Europe.
But Van Hollen said he also fears that Trump’s plan has set back the chances of making a deal. “In addition to being outrageous on its face, it’s further emboldened the far right and made it more difficult to achieve an overall settlement,” he said.
Hamas’s objections are another potential spoiler to any plan, as is the thorny question of who will provide security in Gaza. Hamas still holds weapons stockpiles, while the security vacuum has led to a rise in criminal gangs.
“There is still a very challenging and complicated road ahead, even if Arab leaders present a realistic plan,” said Blumenthal, adding that Abdullah has been “very clear-eyed and realistic” in his thinking.
But while the gaps remain wide, both Trump and Netanyahu want a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and also to maintain a regional coalition against Iran as Israel mulls <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/12/israel-iran-us-intelligence/"" target=_blank>strikes against Tehran’s nuclear program</a>.
“There is a golden opportunity for Israel to integrate with the region and recognize its wildest dreams,” said Katulis.
While Trump’s initial proposal to empty Gaza of its inhabitants sparked anger in Saudi Arabia, the close ties between the two powers were on full display this week.
Trump made an appearance at a Saudi investment summit in Miami after tapping Riyadh to host talks to end the war in Ukraine. The coverage in Saudi media was glowing. Saudi Arabia “has achieved success on all fronts,” proclaimed a column in Asharq al-Awsat by Tariq Alhomayed, the newspaper’s former editor.
Speaking at the summit in Miami on Thursday, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, addressed Gaza and appeared to dial back elements of the president’s plan that had caused alarm, saying some of Trump’s comments had been misconstrued.
The level of destruction is so great, a five-year development plan “is not physically possible,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we are on an eviction plan,” he said. “It means the president wants to shake up everybody’s thinking.”
Witkoff said Arab leaders are now considering new solutions for rebuilding Gaza, ideas that “people would have never considered, and I think that’s a good thing.”

First, I need to check the allowed categories. The options include things like Abortion, AI, Associated Press, Birthright citizenship, CFPB, Climate, etc. Looking at the content, the main topic here is Gaza and the political responses from Arab leaders and Trump's proposal.

The category ""Gaza"" is listed as an option. That seems directly relevant because the article discusses Trump's plan for Gaza and the Arab countries' alternative. Other categories like Foreign policy or Israel might be close, but ""Gaza"" is more specific. There's also ""Foreign aid"" mentioned, but the focus here isn't on aid distribution but rather on political plans and governance in Gaza.

I don't see any mention of other key terms like debt ceiling, health care, or immigration policy. The main subject is clearly Gaza and the international response to Trump's proposal. So the most specific category here is ""Gaza"".

"President Donald Trump was officially elected chair of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Wednesday, installing a new board of trustees as he furthers his executive authority to remake one of the nation’s premier cultural institutions.

"The Department of Housing and Urban Development, acting on a directive from DOGE, is moving to terminate more than $1.1 billion in loans and grants awarded to improve the energy efficiency and weather resilience of multifamily housing, according to a department official with knowledge of the order.
The termination of the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program puts into jeopardy more than 260 projects across the country, several of which have already begun construction. The projects were expected to create “hundreds, if not thousands of jobs” according to the department official. “It’s unfortunate that they are targeting such an effective program just because it has the word ‘green’ in its name,” the official said.
The department communications office did not respond to questions from The Washington Post. The move is likely to spark legal challenges, as the congressionally authorized funds were already awarded by the department, which is now trying to claw them back.
The program, created through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is targeted at upgrading subsidized housing units. It is designed to help building owners and residents lower their utility bills by using less energy, as well as help fund improvements such as fire-resistant roofs and new heating systems that will prolong the life of the units.
“This program helps to rehabilitate affordable apartments, making sure residents have lower utility costs and can survive extreme weather,” said Lowell Ungar, federal policy director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “You disrupt that and it means higher bills for those who can least afford them and greater risk from storms and heat waves.”",HUD moves to cancel $1.1 billion in already-awarded housing upgrades,"[FAIL] (0.00)

"The Federal Aviation Administration is close to canceling a $2.4 billion contract to overhaul a communications system that serves as the backbone of the nation’s air traffic control system and awarding the work to Elon Musk’s Starlink, according to two people briefed on the plans.
The move to cancel a major contract in favor of a venture led by Musk — who is leading<b> </b>President Donald Trump’s disruptive<b> </b>overhaul of the federal government through the U.S. DOGE Service — would represent a significant test of protections against conflicts of interest in government projects. It would be an especially extraordinary step for the typically cautious FAA, whose systems are vital to the safety of millions of air travelers every day.
The existing contract was awarded to Verizon in 2023, with the aim of upgrading a platform that different air traffic control facilities and FAA offices use to communicate with one another.
Musk has personally taken aim at Verizon on his social media platform X in recent days, <a href=""https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1894202642639061144"" target=_blank>saying on Monday</a>: “The Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.”
Verizon did not respond to a request for comment. Joseph Russo, a Verizon executive vice president, said at an event hosted by Barclays Bank on Tuesday that Starlink’s efforts at FAA might be complementary to Verizon’s. Verizon was offering the “reliability and performance” that the FAA needed, and its system was expected to be operational soon, Russo said.
The FAA said in a statement Wednesday that “no decisions have been made” about the Verizon project.
A team of employees from SpaceX, Starlink’s parent company, has been working inside the FAA in recent days, charged by the Trump administration with helping modernize the agency’s aging technology. Ted Malaska, one of them, shared a<a href=""https://x.com/TedMalaska/status/1892705202576277926"" target=_blank> picture on X on Thursday</a> saying he was excited to be working with the FAA, and thanking Musk and Trump for their “vision and focus on safety.”
“I challenge anyone to question the honesty and my technical integrity on this matter,” Malaska <a href=""https://x.com/TedMalaska/status/1894787084663300535"" target=_blank>posted Wednesday</a>. “I am working without biases for the safety of people that fly.”
Several of the SpaceX employees now have FAA email addresses, according to two people who have seen the addresses, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. FAA regulates SpaceX and has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/17/faa-spacex-fine-elon-musk-regulation/"" target=_blank>alleged</a> that the company has violated safety rules relating to its rocket launches.
In a statement Monday, the FAA said it was testing Starlink systems at facilities in New Jersey and Alaska, in hopes of providing more reliable connectivity in remote locations. Elements of the FAA’s deliberations were previously reported by the Associated Press and Bloomberg News.
Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369262913112"" target=_blank>on Fox News this week</a> that the government had been too slow to modernize its technology and that the new administration was ready to move quickly.
“We’re going to look at a year, year-and-a-half time frame and do massive upgrades, improve the systems, help air traffic controllers, keep our skies safer,” Duffy said.
But the Starlink plan adds to Musk’s existing conflicts of interest at the FAA relating to SpaceX, according to John P. Pelissero, the director of an ethics center at Santa Clara University.
Pelissero said it appears that “because of Musk’s current position in DOGE and his closeness to Trump he and his company are getting an advantage and getting a contract.”
“Who’s looking out for the public interest here when you get the person who’s cutting budgets and personnel from the FAA, suddenly trying to benefit from still another government contract?” Pelissero said.
The Transportation Department, DOGE and SpaceX did not respond to questions on how the process of changing contractors has been handled and whether potential conflicts of interest have been reviewed. Trump has said Musk will not be permitted to participate in decisions that pose a conflict of interest.
Verizon was tapped in 2023 to build a system called the FAA Enterprise Network Services Program or FENS, replacing a system that dates to 2002. The contract had a 15-year lifespan, and the system is intended to connect some 4,600 sites, according to the FAA.
The agency was scheduled to make a final decision on whether<b> </b>to start paying Verizon for the contract next month, said one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
Instead, Musk’s team determined the job should go to Starlink, the person said. But the process for unwinding a contract and awarding it to another company is lengthy and has not been followed in this case so far, the person said.
Several senior FAA officials have refused to sign paperwork authorizing the switch,<b> </b>according to the person, who has been briefed on the internal deliberations and resulting fallout, so Musk’s team is now seeking help from the acting administrator of the agency, Trump appointee Chris Rocheleau, and Duffy.
Outside reviews of the FAA’s technology have repeatedly concluded in recent years that it is woefully out of date and that the agency is too slow to make upgrades. A 2023 <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/NAS_safety_review_team_report.pdf"" target=_blank>safety review pointed to technological problems</a> as one factor that was creating “risk” in the aviation system, a problem the Verizon contract is supposed to help solve.
Jessica Tillipman, the associate dean for government and procurement law studies at George Washington University School of Law, said terminating a contract can be expensive, time consuming and could lead to litigation.
“When the government terminates a contract it’s not like it shuts off the spigot,” she said. “It’s expensive to wind down a contract. It’s very expensive and it’s complicated.”
She said negotiating a settlement can take a year.
In awarding a new contract, agencies must comply with the Competition and Contracting Act, which requires competition in government procurements. It does have some exceptions. Among those: national security, public interest or urgency, she said.
“But the question is, how is it so urgent when you already had a contractor dealing with it?,” said Tillipman, adding that there are many different guardrails within the federal acquisition system to make sure things are fair, transparent and efficient.
“However, in the last few weeks she said many of these guardrails have been tested, which will likely lead to litigation,” she said.

"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the United States will soon sell a $5 million “gold card” to give foreign nationals “green card privileges” and a “route to citizenship.”
Trump made the announcement during an executive order signing in the Oval Office, telling reporters, “Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card.”
“They’ll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it’s going to be extremely successful,” Trump said, claiming that the program — which he said will  begin in about two weeks under his executive authority and without the approval of Congress — is “totally legal.”
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters in the Oval Office that the Trump administration will be ending<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/07/23/trump-officials-revamp-rules-foreign-investor-golden-visa-program/"" target=_blank> the controversial EB-5 investor visa</a> — sometimes referred to by critics as the “golden visa.” The citizenship pathway created in 1990 requires significant investments in a new business that would create full-time jobs in the United States.
Lutnick said the $5 million requirement for the “gold card” would be paid “to the U.S. government” and applicants would require “thorough vetting.”
Lutnick suggested the money would be used “to reduce our deficit,” but Trump would not definitively state whether that money would be earmarked specifically for deficit reduction. The president said that if “gold card” holders create jobs within the United States, “they’ll pay full taxes like everybody else.”
Trump also said he anticipated that the card would be used by American companies seeking to bring in talent from abroad.
When asked whether Russian oligarchs would be eligible for a “gold card,” Trump responded, “Yeah, possibly. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people.”",Trump: Government will sell $5 million ‘gold card’ to wealthy immigrants,"[PASS] (1.00)

For “a small fee compared to what we pay” in government-run and private prisons in this country, he said, “we can make deals where we get these animals out of our country.”
He said his administration was examining the legality of such action.
Trump’s comments, made in response to questions from reporters witnessing his signing of new executive orders at the White House, came after Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said this week that he would imprison U.S. criminals for payment.

"The Trump administration put scores of additional employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave Tuesday, dealing a further blow to the beleaguered aid agency.
In a new letter, Pete Marocco, who was appointed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a senior agency official, told affected USAID personnel they were being put on a paid “excused absence” effective immediately.
“During the period that you are on administrative leave you are not to enter USAID premises, access USAID systems, or attempt to use your position or authority with USAID in any way without my prior permission or prior permission of a supervisor in your chain of command,” Marocco said in the letter, copies of which were obtained by The Washington Post.
It was not immediately clear how many employees were affected. One USAID official said the number could be as high as 1,400.
The move is the latest action since Trump’s return to the White House impacting USAID employees, many of whom have been furloughed or forced out of their jobs, and America’s overseas assistance programs, many of which were suspended while the new administration conducts a review of USAID’s activities.
The campaign to overhaul — and potentially abolish — USAID has been led by billionaire Elon Musk, who is advising Trump in his effort to shrink the federal government. Musk has tweeted that USAID “must die.”
Placing officials on administrative leave has hamstrung large parts of USAID just as humanitarian groups around the world seek exemptions to Trump’s 90-day aid freeze. Officials who received the letter were immediately locked out of emails and unable to manage the flood of exemption requests, a bottleneck that aid workers say has prevented life-saving aid projects from restarting across the developing world.
USAID did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Democrats have vowed to fight any attempt to dismantle the agency, citing its creation in statute. A Democratic Senate aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Tuesday’s move to put additional staff on leave was “sweeping in nature.”","In new order, Trump administration places more USAID staff on leave","[PASS] (1.00)

"President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday imposing 25 percent tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the latest salvo in his ongoing effort to overhaul the U.S. trading relationship with the rest of the world.
“This is a big deal — making America rich again,” Trump said as he signed the orders.
The tariffs are likely to renew tensions between the United States and its North American neighbors, which are among the largest suppliers of steel imports. The president last week paused plans to impose a separate set of import taxes on goods from Canada and Mexico, which he linked to concerns over immigration and drug trafficking.
Canada, the No. 1 foreign supplier, last year shipped 6.6 million tons of steel to American buyers, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.

"The Trump administration took another swing at the Federal Reserve’s independence late Tuesday with a new executive order that seeks more control over federal agencies that have traditionally operated with day-to-day autonomy.
Even as the White House executive order said it would protect the Fed’s monetary policy — including its powers to set interest rates — it sought to scoop up all of Wall Street’s biggest regulators and make their budgets subject to the authority of the White House budget office.
It’s just the latest political attack on the Fed, a 111-year institution responsible for setting short-term borrowing costs that trickle through the financial sector and influence what millions of consumers and businesses pay to borrow money. It also plays a key role supervising and regulating Wall Street.
It’s possible little of Tuesday’s order will ultimately apply to the Fed because Congress established the central bank to operate with significant independence in determining how to use its resources. The order notes it does not seek to “impair” any authorities Congress has given to independent agencies.
“Time, the courts and Congress will ultimately determine whether and how much of this sticks,” said Scott Alvarez, a former general counsel at the Fed. “What’s important at this point is the President has announced he wants to dismantle a system of independent agencies that Congress has established and the courts have upheld and wants to shift funding decisions from Congress and the appropriations process to himself.”
Laws and norms have traditionally protected the Fed from the executive branch, with the aim of demonstrating to global markets that U.S. monetary policy isn’t at the mercy of the political whims of the White House. But President Donald Trump has made clear he thinks he <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/23/trump-federal-reserve/"" target=_blank>should get more of a say</a>.
The Fed declined to comment. A White House spokesman had no immediate comment.
For their part, Fed officials of their own volition have already made a series of decisions in the first weeks of the Trump administration to align internal policies with lawful directives from the White House, with the aim of avoiding a dispute with the administration, Fed watchers say.
Almost immediately after Trump was sworn into office, Fed officials announced a suspension of “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs, as well as a systemwide hiring freeze, according to emails reviewed by The Washington Post. The Fed is also trying to align to Trump’s return-to-office policies, with officials considering reductions to remote work.
“As has been our practice over many administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,” Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell told reporters earlier this month.
The difference in the move on Tuesday is that the White House appears to be trying to force the changes on the Fed when it comes to its oversight and regulation of Wall Street. The order requires that independent agencies submit major regulations to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review.
The new order also states that only the president and the attorney general — “subject to the President’s supervision and control” — will interpret law on behalf of the executive branch, blocking independent federal agencies from adopting legal interpretations that are at odds with the Trump White House.
OMB is run by Russell Vought, a fiscal hawk who helped to craft Project 2025, a controversial policy blueprint that has informed Trump’s return to the White House. Specifically, Project 2025 suggests the Fed’s role should be narrowed to only keeping the money supply stable, <a href=""https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-24.pdf"" target=_blank>not regulating Wall Street banks or acting as a lender of last resort when big banks fail</a>, because “political pressure has led the Federal Reserve to use its power to regulate banks as a way to promote politically favorable initiatives,” the paper said.
Fed watchers say the central bank’s actions to date suggest it wants to choose its battles carefully, avoiding conflicts with Trump that don’t directly threaten its control over monetary policy. The Fed has fiercely protected its independence since the high-inflation era of the 1970s. That period was partly driven by the central bank’s own missteps under pressure from President Richard M. Nixon to keep rates low, despite signs that the economy was overheating, to help his reelection campaign.
“The Fed is willing to go all 15 rounds with the sitting president to preserve its ability to make interest-rate policy separate from the Oval Office,” said Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania. “It is not willing to separate itself from the Oval Office on nearly anything else.”
“The White House — for now, at least — appears to insist on precisely this balance of power,” he added. “The question only remains whether President Trump and those closest to him will continue to regard even monetary policy as outside of his immediate control.”
For months, Trump officials have privately discussed ways to streamline the alphabet soup of agencies responsible for overseeing Wall Street. One approach envisions consolidating agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency into a single entity, according to people familiar with the discussions granted anonymity to convey internal plans.
Lacking sufficient votes in the Senate to overhaul the financial regulatory system, the White House’s order could provide a backup approach to trying to consolidate at least some control of financial regulation, even if it remains unlikely the Fed’s regulatory functions wind up under the direct purview of the president. The Fed, the FDIC and the comptroller are the three primary federal banking regulators.
It’s not the first time the Fed has moved quickly to align its policies with those of a new administration. At the start of Trump’s first term, the central bank similarly adopted a hiring freeze ordered across the government by the president.
This time, the political environment is more hostile to the Fed. During Trump’s first term, some Republican senators backed Powell against repeated efforts by Trump to undermine the independence of the Fed. Most of those lawmakers are no longer in office.
The push for more say over the Fed comes after Michael Barr, the Fed’s vice chairman for banking supervision, last month said he would step down from the role at the end of this month, avoiding a potential legal fight over whether Trump had the authority to demote him.
The Fed’s move to comply with earlier orders from the White House has been evident in the way it immediately removed public-facing webpages highlighting the board’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts following a directive from Trump that agencies cease such work.
The shift is notable at some regional Fed banks. At the New York Fed, officials canceled a reception scheduled for Thursday and also withdrew from a summer fellowship program that aimed to support women and underrepresented groups in economics, according to a social media post from Yana van der Meulen Rodgers, an economist at Rutgers University. A bank official attributed the cancellations to the suspension of DEI work, according to an email reviewed by The Post.
The New York Fed declined to comment.
At the Kansas City Fed, top officials told staff members on Halloween — less than a week before the presidential election — that the bank’s commitment to DEI “remains steadfast,” according to a message to the bank’s roughly 2,000 employees reviewed by The Post.
That contrasted sharply with a Jan. 28 message from the top two officials at each Fed bank announcing the system was “temporarily pausing” diversity initiatives through at least February.

"The United States and India are working toward a deal that aims to cut America’s sizable trade gap with India as New Delhi pledges to buy more U.S. energy, weapons and civil nuclear power, President Donald Trump said Thursday during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington.
The meeting with Modi — the fourth foreign leader to visit Trump in the White House since his inauguration — was one of the earliest measures of how Trump will handle his relationship with New Delhi. The partnership is a pillar of Washington’s strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, but one that is beset with trouble spots on illegal immigration, visas, America’s large trade deficit with India and controversies over India’s attempted assassination of a Sikh activist on American soil.
During the news conference, Trump sought to emphasize the friendship between Washington and New Delhi, even as he announced shortly before it that the United States would implement a “reciprocal” tariff policy that would tax foreign goods at the same rate that other nations apply to American products, potentially complicating talks with India.
Trump said the United States will increase military sales to India by “many billions of dollars” and would consider providing New Delhi F-35 fighter jets. He reiterated his dismay with India’s tariffs toward the United States, but said the two countries will negotiate a trade deal that will ensure a “level playing field.” Trump said India will reform its laws to welcome U.S. nuclear technology into its domestic market.
On the issue of immigration — which sparked outrage in India after the Trump administration sent deportees back to the country in shackles on military fights — Modi said New Delhi will comply with Trump’s desires. “We are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they have absolutely no right to be in that country,” Modi said.
In one of the few moments the Indian prime minister spoke English, Modi became the latest leader trying to foster a personal relationship with Trump. The Indian leader borrowed from Trump’s “Make America Great Again” rhetoric to announce his own vision: Make India Great Again, or MIGA, he said in English, adding that the two countries could continue to help each other.
“When it’s MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes ‘mega’ — a mega-partnership for prosperity,” the Indian prime minister said, according to a translator.
The United States is India’s <a href=""https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-india/"">largest</a> trading partner, buying more than 18 percent of all its exports. India exported $45 billion more to the United States than it imported, and Trump is keen to shrink that deficit. The lack of parity, as well as lingering frustration from a trade deal that never materialized during his first term, drove Trump to describe India on the campaign trail last year as a “very big abuser” of tariffs.
In a call with Modi <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/readout-of-president-donald-j-trumps-call-with-prime-minister-modi-of-india/"">last month</a> — the second such conversation between the two leaders since the American election — Trump stressed the “importance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship,” according to a White House readout.
Modi visited Washington <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/indias-modi-meet-trump-with-planned-tariff-concessions-2025-02-10/"">armed</a> with concessions aimed at averting a trade war and staving off damaging tariffs on the world’s fifth-largest economy. The concessions include a commitment to significantly boost purchases of American energy. New Delhi has already reduced tariffs on high-end American motorcycles — a fixation for Trump, who repeatedly called the 100 percent duty on Harley-Davidsons “unacceptable.”
India signaled it was open to offering tariff concessions for imports from the United States in several sectors, including electronics, medical equipment and chemicals, an analyst familiar with the matter said. The Modi administration is looking at potential deals on U.S. agriculture exports and nuclear energy investments, the analyst added, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Reuters earlier reported the possible concessions.
Ahead of his meeting with Trump, Modi on Thursday met with the president’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz. He also held meetings with billionaire Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, according to Indian officials. On Wednesday, he held talks with Trump’s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard.
During the news conference Thursday evening, the two leaders said a key path to shrinking America’s trade gap with India involves selling billions of dollars worth of energy, especially liquid natural gas, to India. The Biden administration had paused liquid natural gas project approvals as part of its effort to curb climate change. While the leaders were speaking, Waltz posted on X: “Drill Baby Drill = Buy Baby Buy.”
Modi said that India and the United States will collaborate on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum technology. Trump said the United States would also extradite one of the plotters of the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai.
Also, Modi announced that India was moving to change its liability laws to enable U.S. civil nuclear energy firms to sell reactors there. The law currently puts liability on the supplier, not the operator.
Such a move would be “a long-sought win for the Trump administration,” said Lindsey Ford, White House director for South Asia in the Biden administration. “But Modi’s decision to announce a similar agreement with France one day prior is a reminder for the United States that U.S. technology will not be the only game in town.”
A sign of the growing confidence between the two governments was Trump’s statement that his administration was open to considering selling the vaunted F-35 stealth fighter jet to India, a weapons platform the United States makes available to only its closest and most trusted allies and partners.
But the weapon is costly and India would need to “dramatically overhaul and upgrade its industrial security procedures to better protect against espionage and technology leakage,” said Sameer Lalwani, a senior expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace.
“It’s a gesture of trust” that Trump was even willing to contemplate that, he said. But the Indians are intent on building their own fighter jets, he said.
There would also be significant national security concerns with selling the fifth-generation fighter to India, which has recently fielded Russian S-400 air defense systems. Operating the two near one another enhances the risk that the Russian air defenses could acquire data that compromises the fighter’s stealth signature, and could be used by Russia or China to better detect and target American F-35s, he said.
The trip also came in the wake of tensions around immigration. Last week, scenes of the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/modi-trump-white-house-india-immigration-tariffs/"">dramatic deportation of more than 100 Indians</a>, who were sent back in shackles on a military jet, caused enormous embarrassment to Modi domestically. India is a major source of illegal immigration to the United States. As of 2022, it accounted for 725,000 out of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, according to the Pew Research Center.
Over the Christmas holiday, far-right activists in Trump’s base engaged in a “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/27/h-1b-visas-elon-musk-trump-immigration/"">civil war</a>” with Musk and other senior Trump allies over the need for a skilled-worker visa program that Silicon Valley has long relied on. Many Indians decried the backlash as “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/07/india-maga-h1b-visa-america/"">racist</a>.”





Modi said he did not discuss with Trump whether the American president would take action on the U.S. court case against Gautam Adani, an Indian billionaire and ally of the Indian prime minister accused of bribery schemes.
Trump and Modi have forged a positive relationship since their first meeting in 2017, punctuated by reciprocal mass rallies — “Howdy Modi” in Houston in 2019 and “Namaste Trump” in Ahmedabad, India, in 2020. Their bond stems from a shared strategic interest in countering China as well as the cultivation of a strongman image.
Washington has over the past 20 years grown closer to New Delhi, slowly diminishing India’s decades-long dependence on Russian arms, for instance, though it has been buying large quantities of Russian oil.
Heightened tensions with China after deadly border clashes in 2020 helped drive India closer to the United States, which has provided intelligence and equipment, including leased Predator drones, to help India defend its frontier.
Trump in his first term revived a grouping known as “the Quad,” consisting of India, Japan, the United States and Australia, widely seen as a counterweight to China’s growing influence in the region. The Biden administration advanced the initiative, and analysts say that Trump may push the group in a more security-oriented direction.
The two countries established <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/01/31/india-us-tech-defense/"">a significant partnership</a> in emerging technology during the Biden administration, announcing for instance co-production plans for military jet engines and armored infantry vehicles.
One area that is likely to have a lower profile now is human rights, analysts said. The attempted assassination of the Sikh activist in 2023 caused tension between the two governments and led to murder-for-hire charges against an Indian intelligence official, who has since left the government.
Administration officials declined to comment on the matter on Thursday.
“I think now that issue is somewhat behind us,” said Lisa Curtis, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a White House South Asia aide in Trump’s first term.
Trump also sought to flatter his Indian counterpart, grinning as he responded to a question about who won their negotiations.
“He’s a much tougher negotiator than me,” Trump said. “He’s a much better negotiator than me.”

"The Justice Department is recruiting new attorneys to help defend President Donald Trump’s immigration and other policies in court, according to public job postings, department officials and legal experts.
The aim is to create a cadre of lawyers with the skills and willingness to back the administration as it gears up for legal challenges on <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/24/birthright-citizenship-democrats-lawsuits/"" target=_blank>birthright citizenship</a>, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/25/guantanamo-trump-migrants-deportations-venezuela/"" target=_blank>sending migrants</a> to Guantánamo Bay, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/26/doge-federal-workforce-firings-job-cuts/"" target=_blank>federal workforce firings</a>, deep spending cuts and more.
The hirings are largely to fill openings created by the high number of civil division attorneys who have resigned since the 2024 presidential election, according to people familiar with the situation, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals and to discuss sensitive information.
But the effort also gives the Justice Department an opportunity to bring a slew of attorneys who align ideologically with the president into career positions in high-profile sections of the department.
Multiple job postings say the Justice Department is seeking “many” attorneys to work in its Federal Programs Branch and the Office of Immigration Litigation. Both departments are in the civil division, and their attorneys would be at the forefront of deportation fights and defending the most controversial executive branch policies, including a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/25/trump-refugee-ban-blocked/"" target=_blank>refugee ban</a>, terminations of government workers and the slashing of government agencies.
The attorneys would work under senior political appointees being hired to the Justice Department, many of whom are attorneys from conservative law firms and Republican state governments.
“President Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda is a top national security priority that this Department of Justice is prepared to vigorously defend whenever challenged in court,” a spokesperson for the department said in a statement.
The Justice Department is also planning to temporarily assign people to the civil divisions from other offices to defend Trump administration policies, according to a public listing on LinkedIn. At least some of those detailees could come from the civil rights division — an area of the Justice Department that is expected to have dwindling workload demands during the Trump administration.
And attorneys in departments that do not typically deal with immigration enforcement are being asked to handle some immigration matters, the people familiar with the situation said.
The job listings, coupled with interviews with current and former Justice Department officials, suggest that the Trump administration is preparing for extensive and prolonged legal battles in court, with the department seeking both trial attorneys and those who specialize in the appeals process.
Already, the Trump administration is facing more than 80 lawsuits over its efforts to dramatically reshape the federal government and national policies. Several initiatives have been temporarily blocked by lower-court judges, and so far two have reached the Supreme Court.
While many federal agencies are slashing probationary employees and laying off workers en masse, the Justice Department workforce has largely remained intact since Trump took office.
His administration has pushed out or transferred top career officials who held powerful jobs in agency, creating uncertainty and mistrust among the career workforce by according to people familiar. But it has not fired or laid off large swaths of rank and file attorneys or staff.
Still, there has been high staff turnover in key divisions, creating an opportunity for the Trump administration to hire more career attorneys who strongly support its legal positions and approach.
In some government agencies, the federal hiring freeze mandated by the Trump White House has meant that they cannot replace people who quit. At Justice — with many jobs focused on Trump’s priorities of boosting deportations and combating violent crime — the hirings have continued.
Around a third of the 130 attorneys in the Federal Programs Branch have quit the Justice Department since Election Day, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. More resignations are expected as the workload and demands pile up, these people said.
While federal law would prohibit Justice Department officials from asking about the political ideologies during the hiring process of career employees, legal experts said that the federal programs branch is always entwined with White House policies. In the Biden administration, for example, attorneys in this division defended the president’s student loan forgiveness plans, covid mandates, challenges to firearm regulations and more.
People who are strongly against Trump administration policies would be unlikely to apply for a job that would put them at the forefront of defending those policies, people familiar with how the branch works said.
In general, the office is filled with career staffers, a group of whom may disagree with any given administration, the people said. Career staffers and political appointees are supposed to work together to find strong strategies for defending presidential policies that meet legal muster — a process that often entails disagreements and workshopping legal arguments.
But some attorneys are frustrated because they are being asked simply to defend Trump’s policies, with little room for discussion or dissent, according to a former civil division employee who is familiar with the branch’s current dynamics.
The Office of Immigration Litigation is a division of more than 300 attorneys who typically handle the process of stripping citizenship from immigrants who commit crimes or have used fraud on their naturalization applications. These attorneys also defend the government when there is an appeal of a decision made in the administrative immigration courts.

An attorney from the Office of Immigration Litigation was also listed on the Trump administration’s civil lawsuits against the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, which seek to block state and local protections for undocumented immigrants. Involvement in cases like this is unusual for the Office of Immigration Litigation, people familiar with the office said.
The Trump administration has also created a division focused on fighting what are known as “sanctuary cities,” which are typically Democratic cities with a policy of protecting immigrants who are in the country illegally and not cooperating with federal authorities to deport them.
Justice Department officials have transferred veteran career officials from other divisions — many of whom have little background in immigration law — to this office, giving them the option of quitting if they do not want to work there.
The office is reporting to the deputy attorney general. Officials say it is up and running, though it is unclear what litigation the office is working on.",Justice Dept. hires for court battles as Trump slashes other agencies,"[FAIL] (0.00)

"JERICHO, West Bank — The Trump administration has stopped all funding to the Palestinian Authority security forces as part of the global freeze on foreign assistance, according to U.S. and Palestinian officials.
The freeze comes at a critical time for the embattled authority as it struggles to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/11/palestinian-authority-secuirty-forces-west-bank-faq/"" target=_blank>maintain its rule</a> in pockets of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and jockeys to govern a postwar Gaza Strip. The security forces, which are chronically underfunded and widely unpopular, are nonetheless <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/05/palestinian-authority-security-forces-gaza/"" target=_blank>considered a linchpin to the Palestinian Authority’s ability to maintain law and order</a> in both territories.
Washington last stopped direct aid to the authority during Trump’s first term but continued to fund training and reform for the security forces. Exercises and courses are run through the Jerusalem-based Office of the Security Coordinator — formerly known as the U.S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority — which is made up of a consortium of countries.
Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, spokesman for the Palestinian security forces, told The Washington Post that the United States was considered a “big donor to the PA projects” that included security training for the forces.
A former Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue said that the Palestinian Authority security forces were “not affected in any meaningful way” by the freeze and that “other donors have committed to make up the shortfall.”
But the freeze has already led to cuts in some training, a colonel at the authority’s Central Training Institute for security forces told The Post on Tuesday. He spoke on the condition of anonymity per his office’s protocol.
A meeting planned with American officials this month to assess the authority’s operation targeting militants in the Jenin refugee camp — which stopped after Israeli forces invaded last month — was postponed and has not been rescheduled, he said. Washington was also funding the building of a virtual shooting range, which the institute needs because Israel will not permit the importation of bullets for live-fire training sessions, the colonel said. Though the project was almost completed, the institute is seeking alternative funders because of the U.S. freeze, he said.
Confirmation of the aid freeze comes amid widespread confusion about programs the Trump administration is saving or suspending.
U.S. officials have been loath to specify <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/29/pepfar-trump-hiv-aids-aid-pause/"" target=_blank>what programs</a> are spared under exemptions issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio for “lifesaving” assistance, aid to Israel, HIV prevention programs and other priorities. And even in cases when exemptions apply, aid organizations have in many cases been unable to continue to work because Rubio’s directives have effectively shut down the payment systems required to draw down funds.
The United States has for years supported the Palestinian Authority security forces, viewing them as critical to Israel’s security. The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has provided approximately $1.1 billion in civilian security and justice assistance to support the authority’s security forces since 2007, the State Department said last year.
The Biden administration also backed proposals for the Palestinian Authority to play a key role in postwar Gaza, which both Israel and Hamas, the authority’s internal rival, oppose.
The authority is struggling to control a new generation of Palestinian militancy in the West Bank that’s centered in the territory’s northern refugee camps and draws support from widespread frustration with the aging authority leadership, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, who is 89.

The State Department said the funding is under review but did not provide clarity on when a determination is likely to be made. “The Department and USAID paused nearly all foreign assistance,” the department said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Agency for International Development. “The Department of State has granted waivers for critical programming that aligns with Administration priorities in the region.”

"President Donald Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) briefly sparred Friday over the president’s threat to withhold federal funds from her state if it doesn’t comply with a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/05/transgender-students-trump-executive-order/"" target=_blank>recent executive order barring transgender athletes</a> from competing on women’s sports teams.
In a gathering with a group of governors at the White House, Trump began to talk about one of his signature culture war promises when he asked whether anyone among the governors gathered at the White House was from Maine. The Maine Principals’ Association has said it will not enforce his executive order aiming to ban trans athletes from competing in girls’ sports.
“You better do it because you’re not going to get federal funding,” Trump said to Mills.
“We’re going to follow the law, sir. We’ll see you in court,” she said.
“Enjoy your life after governor because I don’t think you’ll be in elected office,” Trump said to the term-limited governor.
The back-and-forth followed Trump’s remark Thursday to a group of Republican governors that he would withhold federal funds from Maine unless the state complies with his executive order.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington on behalf of six service members, challenges the order’s legality on constitutional grounds, stating that affected service members have built their lives around military service.
The order said the U.S. military has been “afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists” and that “many mental and physical health conditions are incompatible with active duty.”
The Defense Department said in a statement that it “will fully execute and implement all directives outlined in Executive Orders by the President, ensuring they are carried out with utmost professionalism, efficiency, and in alignment with national security objectives. We will provide status updates as we are able.”
Trump’s action is a dangerous rollback of rights and equality, a key component of global human rights agreements to which the United States has been party, said Karla Gonzales Garcia, director of Amnesty International USA’s gender, sexuality and identity program.
“In its attacks on transgender people, whether in military service or through trying to redefine sex and gender in an attempt to erase transgender people, the Trump administration has made hate and discrimination its agenda,” she said in a statement. “Not only will today’s directive violate the human rights of thousands of Americans, it also sends a dangerous message to the rest of the world.”",Lawsuit filed over Trump’s order targeting transgender service members,"[PASS] (1.00)

The NSF, a $10 billion agency that spreads research dollars across the country in quantities both large and small, issued a brief statement Monday that added minimal clarity to a situation that had alarmed researchers.
“All review panels scheduled for the remainder of this week, 1/28-1/31 will be rescheduled to a future date as appropriate,” an NSF spokesperson said in an email. “This will allow the agency to make the best use of everyone’s time and resources as we continue to develop guidance to ensure compliance with the recent executive orders.”
The broader scientific community has been scrambling for the past week amid a flurry of executive orders from President Donald Trump, including his directive to end all diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Federal science agencies, including NSF, NASA and the National Institutes of Health, have broadly embraced the need to diversify the community of researchers and the subjects they study.
The cancellations at NSF come in the wake of news that NIH had also <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/23/trump-administration-hhs-health-agencies-pause-travel-communications/"" target=_blank>paused the work</a> of study sections that review grants.",National Science Foundation halts reviews of research proposals,"[FAIL] (0.00)

"The U.S. Labor Department has been temporarily blocked by court order from sharing data with Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service, according to an email from a union that represents federal government workers. The email was obtained by The Washington Post.
The temporary order arrives after DOGE representatives visited the Labor Department this week, seeking sensitive data that the agency keeps. In response, a group of powerful unions swiftly sued DOGE in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday, arguing that DOGE’s work was illegal and has “already been catastrophic.”
“Thanks to our swift response and the support of our labor partners, we successfully obtained a temporary order preventing DOL from sharing any data with DOGE,” said an email sent Thursday to rank-and-file Labor Department staffers by AFGE Local 12, a union representing federal government employees.
On Wednesday, a protest led by major unions including the AFL-CIO drew hundreds of people outside the agency’s headquarters in Washington.
The Labor Department manages huge volumes of sensitive data related to the labor market, unemployment claims, disability insurance, workplace health and safety, whistleblower reports and wage theft.
“This order remains in effect until the court rules on the temporary restraining order,” the union email said. “The DOGE will continue to visit but should not be accessing anything.”","Labor Department blocked from sharing data with DOGE, email says","[PASS] (1.00)

"Trump officials have canceled a federal vaccine advisory committee meeting expected to be held<b> </b>next month that was intended to help select the makeup of next winter’s influenza vaccine.
This is the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/"">second federal vaccine advisory panel that has been postponed</a> or canceled since <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/12/how-rfk-jr-once-long-shot-arrived-precipice-trumps-cabinet/"">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, was sworn in as health and human services secretary.
The Food and Drug Administration notified members of its vaccine advisory committee Wednesday that a planned March 13 meeting was canceled, according to an email sent to members that was read to The Washington Post. No reason was provided.
The email warned members against forwarding the email. It suggested members decline to answer questions from media.
HHS and the FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/10/flu-cases-increase-influenza-cdc/"">Influenza viruses</a> change year to year, so vaccines must be updated annually. Federal health officials pick the flu strains that the vaccine will target in advance of the flu season because the production process takes several months.
The FDA usually holds a meeting of its expert panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, in March to accommodate tight manufacturing deadlines and go over discussions about flu strain selection led by the World Health Organization.
The FDA advisory panel meeting includes public presentations from WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Defense, said Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and a critic of Kennedy’s.
“What is the plan for picking this year’s flu strain?” Offit said.
Last week, Trump officials <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/"">postponed</a> a three-day meeting of the vaccine advisory panel to the CDC that was scheduled to begin Wednesday.
During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy repeatedly denied that he is anti-vaccine, contending that he is simply seeking more data and pledging not to undermine confidence in the shots. But public health experts have long warned that as HHS secretary, Kennedy could use his authority to undermine vaccine safety and effectiveness. A pivotal swing vote in Kennedy’s confirmation, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) said he grappled with his vote but later said he had received a list of commitments from Kennedy that included protecting vaccine oversight.
Kennedy was critical of the CDC vaccine panel during his <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/30/rfk-health-secretary-confirmation-hearings/"">confirmation process</a> and has argued that federal agencies are <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/18/trump-health-firings-fda-cdc/"">captive</a> to the industries they regulate.
“We will remove conflicts of interest on the committees and research partners whenever possible, or balance them with other stakeholders,” Kennedy said in remarks to HHS staff earlier this month.

"A Space Force military base in Colorado will serve as a detention center for immigrant detainees facing deportation, Defense Department officials said Wednesday.
In a statement, military officials said facilities would be provided at Buckley Space Force Base for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to stage and process criminal aliens.” The site will be operated by ICE officials and other federal law enforcement agencies, not the U.S. military, according to U.S. Northern Command. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem said during an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News that  the Trump administration might use Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba to house deportees whose home countries won’t take them back.
President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to take on a larger role in U.S. border security and immigration enforcement. Military officials are sending 1,500 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and have prepared to send 10,000. Deportation flights carrying detainees to Guatemala, Colombia and Ecuador in C-17 military transport planes have departed from border areas carrying recent migrants caught attempting to enter the United States.
ICE has the capacity to hold about 40,000 detainees nationwide  in private jails and county facilities where the agency rents beds. Those facilities are nearly full, ICE officials say, and the agency has taken thousands of detainees into custody since Trump took office last week and launched a mass deportation campaign. The use of military bases has raised concerns among ICE officials and immigrant advocates regarding the use of barracks that do not meet detention and safety standards for secure facilities.",Trump plans emerge to use U.S. military bases for immigrant detention,"[FAIL] (0.00)

"President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that aims to ease regulation on cryptocurrency, seeking to fulfill the policy promises he made to the industry after courting its cash and support throughout the 2024 campaign.
The <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/"" target=""_blank"">new directive</a> established a working group to advise Trump on crypto policy, including the possible creation of a national reserve of bitcoin or other tokens. It also tasked federal agencies to review their rules, while revoking an order issued under President Joe Biden designed to improve safeguards on the financial technology.
Trump signed the executive order just days after he widely promoted a new cryptocurrency project that quickly soared in value, potentially generating billions of dollars, in a move that sparked fresh concerns about his commingling of public office and personal business.
In a radical departure from his first term, Trump last year began to align himself with the nation’s crypto elite, who eagerly backed his candidacy in a bid to secure a more favorable regulatory environment in Washington. Appearing at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Trump even promised to turn the United States into the “crypto capital of the planet,” particularly by pursuing policy “written by people who love your industry.”
After he won the White House, the president sought advice from crypto investors including Marc Andreessen, and he tapped fellow Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks to help guide crypto policy in the administration. Trump also nominated Paul Atkins, a veteran regulator who has consulted for crypto firms, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Trump signs executive order to create crypto council, reduce regulation","[PASS] (1.00)

"President <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/"" target=_blank>Donald Trump</a> on Tuesday proposed moving Gazans to a “good, fresh, beautiful piece of land” in another country, offering a vision of mass displacement that would likely inflame sentiments in the Arab world as he prepared to welcome <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/03/netanyahu-trump-white-house-gaza/"" target=_blank>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House</a>.
Trump framed the vision as a practical response to the physical destruction of Gaza after 16 months of intense bombardment from Israel. But given the decades-long history of the displacement of Palestinians in the region, as well as vows by the Israeli far-right to claim the Gaza Strip for themselves, Trump’s proposal was likely to provoke a furious reaction from many Palestinians as well as their Arab allies in the region, since it suggested permanently removing Gaza’s 2.2 million residents from Palestinian territory and settling them somewhere else.

"A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to pay hundreds of millions in foreign assistance funds that have been in limbo despite his previous directive that such aid resume — action targeting President Donald Trump’s broad pause in aid, which has led to chaos globally and dire warnings about escalating famine.
U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali gave the government until 11:59 p.m. Wednesday to fulfill its contractual obligations and restart payments to contractors whose work in impoverished parts of the world had been largely stopped during an <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/21/usaid-trump-freeze-food-foreign-aid/"">ongoing legal battle</a>. Administration officials must also provide examples of communication sent to partners on the ground about resuming assistance, Ali ruled.
His order applies to work done before Feb. 13.
Aid groups that are plaintiffs in the case provided evidence that the government has not lifted its suspension of funding, Ali said, and the defendants did not rebut that Tuesday.
The administration filed a notice of appeal late Tuesday afternoon. A spokesman has said officials will not discuss the pending litigation outside of court.
During the contentious 90-minute hearing, Justice Department lawyer Indraneel Sur told Ali he was “not in a position to answer” whether the Trump administration had taken needed steps to allow the assistance to begin moving. Sur said the administration would provide further details in a status report due at noon Wednesday.
“I don’t know why I can’t get a straight answer from you,” Ali responded. “We are now 12 days in. You can’t answer me whether any of the funds … covered by the court’s order have been unfrozen?”
The total amount owed to organizations by the U.S. Agency for International Development was not immediately clear, but one development group, DAI Global LLC, said in court filings that it is owed more than $115 million. Separately, the U.N. World Food Program — the largest distributor of food aid — is owed more than $820 million, officials confirmed this week.
More than 10 days of delays have wreaked havoc on some of the world’s poorest and sickest communities. People with HIV have lost access to lifesaving medicines. Those in famine-stricken areas of Sudan and other countries <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/"">are without food</a>.
In an emergency request Monday, the partner organizations said they face possible eviction and threats to worker safety because of the administration’s ongoing defiance of Ali’s federal court order.
“What the government has revealed is that the government has done nothing to make the flow of payments happen,” Stephen K. Wirth, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, said in court.
The groups allege that instead of complying with Ali’s directive, the Trump administration “chose to take a series of new actions” around access to a key reimbursement system, adding new approval processes and terminating “hundreds of critical personnel” — “all but halting the disbursement of foreign-assistance funds,” according to their emergency motion.
Despite the State Department <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/28/state-department-foreign-aid-trump-waiver/"">granting a waiver</a> for certain lifesaving aid to resume, the plaintiffs contend, the payment system remains down, with employees seeing a variety of error messages when they try to submit invoices. Many organizations have not been paid for expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2024, before Trump returned to the White House.
Should the government not comply by Ali’s new deadline, “we are in uncharted and dangerous territory,” Lauren Bateman, another attorney for the plaintiffs, noted via email after Tuesday’s hearing.
The case is among several in which legal experts say the administration has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/20/trump-judge-orders-comply-defy-usaid/"">come close</a> to the red line of disobeying judicial orders as Trump and his allies assert vast<b> </b>presidential powers.
Thousands of federal workers have lost their jobs in recent weeks, adding to the chaos. On Sunday, the administration sent notices that it would <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/"">eliminate</a><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/""><b> </b></a><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/"">1,600 jobs at USAID</a> and place all but a small number of the remaining employees on leave, after a different federal judge ruled that the job-cutting efforts could move forward.
Aid advocates believe the Trump administration is determined to dismantle USAID, the chief U.S. agency for foreign assistance, which provides $40 billion in help each year. The president and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have both derided the diplomats’ work, with Trump calling them “radical lunatics” and Musk vowing USAID must “die.”

“I also will be seeking permission to do so,” Trump continued, musing: “Let them be brought to a foreign land and maintained by others for a very small fee.” He complained about the cost of keeping inmates in the United States.

"An independent federal board on Tuesday <a href=""https://democracyforward.org/updates/breaking-merit-systems-protection-board-stays-termination-of-six-probationary-federal-workers/"" target=""_blank"">granted a request</a> from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) to halt the termination of six probationary government employees amid the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the federal workforce.
The move by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) was in response to a recent request issued by OSC head Hampton Dellinger, in which the watchdog agency argued that the firings were probably illegal and recommended that they be halted pending an investigation, The Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/24/hampton-dellinger-special-counsel-filing-probationary-employees/"" target=""_blank"">reported</a>.
The MSPB, which hears appeals of disciplinary actions against federal employees, said Tuesday that the request for a 45-day stay of the terminations was appropriate “while OSC further investigates their complaints.”
Legal organization Democracy Forward, which filed a complaint on behalf of the six workers Feb. 14 alongside the Alden Law Group, said Tuesday in a statement that the two groups will now work “to expand the stay to cover all probationary federal employees who were unlawfully terminated.”
Democracy Forward president and CEO Skye Perryman called MSPB’s decision “the correct result of a clearly unlawful and massively disruptive action by the Trump administration.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision.
The MSPB’s move could have wider implications for the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/20/fork-resignation-fired-anyway-trump-federal-workers/"" target=_blank>thousands of probationary employees fired</a> in recent weeks as the Elon Musk-led U.S. DOGE Service <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/24/doge-fast-cuts-federal-workers-programs-elon-musk/"" target=_blank>sweeps through federal agencies</a>. Probationary employees, who are newer hires and typically have less job protection, were targeted in cuts earlier this month, and government agencies are in the process of <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/pentagon-job-cuts-trump-hegseth/"" target=_blank>firing</a> <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/20/irs-layoffs-trump-firings-doge/"" target=_blank>thousands</a> more <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/14/trump-presidency-news/#link-G2XERKNYDVFETJHARWTYGGIKJU"" target=_blank>workers</a>.
Dellinger is “considering ways to seek relief for a broader group,” OSC said in a <a href=""https://osc.gov/News/Pages/25-22-Stay-Request-Probationary-Employees.aspx"" target=_blank>statement</a> Monday, while worker advocates hope an investigation could end with a remedy for all fired federal workers.
OSC, which investigates whistleblower reports filed by government workers, is tasked with investigating and prosecuting complaints about prohibited personnel practices in the federal workforce, such as retaliation or rule-breaking, that violate the merit system.
President Donald Trump has tried to oust <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/16/trump-supreme-court-executive-power/"" target=_blank>Dellinger</a> and MSPB chair <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/18/merit-systems-protection-board-cathy-harris-restored-trump-ouster/"" target=_blank>Cathy Harris</a> as he looks to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/13/trump-firings-watchdogs/"" target=_blank>remake and seize greater control</a> of the federal bureaucracy. Both have sued the Trump administration over their firings, saying their terminations violate federal law, and have been temporarily reinstated by district judges in D.C.
In the Feb. 14 complaint, the six workers allege they were fired during “plainly unlawful” mass terminations that were “indisputably conducted with no regard for the performance or conduct of individual probationary employees.”
The six employees were terminated around the same time as at least 5,000 or more other probationary workers in their agencies, according to estimates cited in Dellinger’s request. They worked for the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, as well as the Office of Personnel Management.
Dellinger found that the employees had not been given notice of any specific issues with their job performance or conduct before being fired. He concluded that the agencies may have violated federal regulations governing how to reduce a workforce or how to terminate probationary employees.
“Firing probationary employees without individualized cause appears contrary to a reasonable reading of the law, particularly the provisions establishing rules for reductions in force,” Dellinger said in the Monday statement.
Alden Law Group partner Michelle Bercovici said in a statement that Tuesday’s decision “reflects the importance of the MSPB and OSC in safeguarding the fundamental merit system principles and most importantly, allows these wrongfully terminated employees to return to their jobs, provide for their families, and continue serving the public with dignity and integrity.”",Federal board halts firings of six probationary employees amid Trump cuts,"[PASS] (1.00)

"The White House issued a freeze on the hiring of civilian employees across the government Monday night, exempting active-duty military personnel and positions related to immigration enforcement, national security and public safety. The order also prohibits the use of outside contractors to get around the freeze, a strategy used by previous administrations to maneuver around hiring caps.
The order also appears to open the door for the permanent federal personnel reductions that President Donald Trump campaigned on. Within 90 days, the administration is directed to come up with plans to “reduce the size of the Federal Government’s workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition.” Then the hiring freeze will be lifted.
The exception is the Internal Revenue Service. The freeze will remain in place there until Trump officials “determine that it is in the national interest” to lift it.",Trump freezes hiring for many federal jobs,"[PASS] (1.00)

"The Trump administration has removed the top official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement one month into his tenure, as White House officials have become <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/ice-arrests-immigration-deportations/"" target=_blank>increasingly frustrated</a> that the agency isn’t arresting immigrants fast enough to satisfy the president’s deportation goals.
Caleb Vitello, a veteran ICE official who was installed as acting director when President Donald Trump took office, will be reassigned to a senior role overseeing daily enforcement operations, according to Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. She did not say who would replace him.
Trump has ordered ICE to carry out the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/interactive/2025/trump-immigrants-mass-deportations/?itid=ap_nickmiroff_9"" target=_blank>largest mass deportation campaign</a> in U.S. history and quickly ramp up the number of immigrants it arrests each day. Despite the administration dedicating a rush of resources to the effort that has included sending thousands of troops to the southern border and assigning thousands of agents and officers from the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies, ICE’s budget and staffing remain largely unchanged, leaving officers scrambling to meet aggressive arrest quotas.
In late January, Vitello told ICE’s 25 field office directors they should arrest at least 75 immigrants per day for a national <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/26/ice-arrests-raids-trump-quota/"" target=_blank>daily total of 1,200 to 1,500</a>. ICE officers have been working six and even seven days a week since then, but Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem and Trump “border czar” Tom Homan have blamed agency officials for falling far short of those goals. Homan did not respond to requests for comment.
Louisiana Secretary of Wildlife and Fisheries<b> </b>Madison Sheahan, a former campaign aide to Noem, is expected to become acting deputy director of ICE, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a position that hadn’t been publicly announced. Sheahan was also <a href=""https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2023/01/19/sheahan-named-executive-director-sd-gop/"" target=_blank>executive director</a> of the South Dakota GOP. A DHS official said that “positions are being reevaluated” and that the agency had “nothing new to announce at this time.”
ICE averaged more than 800 arrests per day nationwide in late January in the 10 days after Trump took office, publishing its results on social media amid a publicity campaign that <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/28/new-york-city-ice-raid/"" target=_blank>invited television crews</a> to embed with officers. The pace of arrests slowed during the first two weeks of February to fewer than 600 daily, and ICE stopped publishing data on social media, saying it would move to a monthly format.
Current and former ICE officials said the enforcement blitz in late January depleted the lists of targets ICE developed before Trump took office with the names, addresses and other data on immigrants they could arrest. Officer teams have not had time to build out new target lists.
Officers have also struggled to meet their quotas because many immigrants are refusing to open their doors when ICE officers knock, according to three ICE officials. Noem has accused FBI agents of leaking sensitive information about upcoming immigration enforcement operations, which the law enforcement agency has pushed back on.<b> </b>The enforcement teams generally do not possess criminal arrest warrants that would allow them to force their way into their targets’ residences. ICE officials say they can’t afford to leave teams of officers waiting for targeted immigrants to leave their homes.
Vitello’s demotion follows the reassignment this month of the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/11/ice-enforcement-officials-reassigned/"" target=_blank>top two officials at ICE’s enforcement division</a>.
A Trump administration official said that Vitello will now oversee field and enforcement operations as part of an effort to expand the team. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the personnel move, said Noem made the decision and it was not done at Trump’s direction.
Vitello’s removal was first reported Friday by <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ice-leadership-changes-trump-deportations-1856e1bb"" target=_blank>The Wall Street Journal</a>. Several ICE staffers said news of his demotion caught them by surprise, and they found out through news alerts.
Jason Houser, chief of staff for ICE under President Joe Biden, said that the White House is asking ICE to “defy the math” and do things that are “unrealistic.”
“The White House needs to look in the mirror,” Houser said. “The dysfunction isn’t with ICE rank-and-file who are trying to do their jobs effectively.”
The Trump administration has sought to take an<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/ice-arrests-immigration-deportations/"" target=_blank> all-of-government approach </a>to immigration enforcement, treating it as a near wartime effort. At least 3,600 servicemen and servicewomen have been sent to the border, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/border-soldiers-texas-migrants-trump/"" target=_blank>according to the </a>Defense Department. The administration has used military planes to transport migrants to locations as far away as India. As ICE has run out of space in its detention centers, the Trump administration has started to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/16/trump-guantanamo-migrants-deportations-venezuela/"" target=_blank>send migrants to the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba</a>, where Trump ordered the construction of a detention camp with 30,000 beds. On Thursday, 177 Venezuelan migrants  at Guantánamo were <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/20/guantanamo-migrants-trump-deportations-honduras/"" target=_blank>deported</a> to their homeland.
Homan has said he is “not happy” with the results so far. Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) said recently that Homan came to the Hill “begging” for additional money. The Senate adopted a budget blueprint early Friday  for legislation to increase border security and immigration enforcement by $175 billion. Trump has backed a competing, more expansive plan in the House.
The Biden administration deported 271,000 people in fiscal year 2024, the highest annual total in a decade. Deportations during Trump’s first term reached a peak of about 267,000 during the 2019 fiscal year, even as he made similar promises. ICE would need to deport more than 2,700 people a day to hit 1 million deportations a year, a goal that veteran immigration officials say is improbable.",Acting ICE director removed amid White House pressure to boost arrests,"[FAIL] (0.00)

"President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he is appointing Sean Curran — the special agent in charge of Trump’s security detail who shielded him during an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally last year — to serve as the next U.S. Secret Service director.
“Sean has distinguished himself as a brilliant leader, who is capable of directing and leading operational security plans for some of the most complex Special Security Events in the History of our Country, and the World,” Trump <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113874811205486989"" target=_blank>wrote </a>in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social. “He proved his fearless courage when he risked his own life to help save mine from an assassin’s bullet in Butler, Pennsylvania. I have complete and total confidence in Sean to make the United States Secret Service stronger than ever before.”
Curran is widely respected for his rigor and skills as a protective detail agent and supervisor, growing extremely close to Trump after serving as the agent in charge of his detail for the past four years. It was Curran, however, who approved assigning a junior detail agent with minimal experience to prepare the security plan for the campaign visit to Butler, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/12/31/butler-trump-secret-service-shooting/"" target=_blank>a plan that failed</a> to address basic security protocols and allowed a would-be assassin a clear shot at Trump from higher ground.
Trump’s appointment of Curran will hearten some longtime agents but also ignores the recommendations of multiple expert panels who have studied the Secret Service’s security failures and recommended fresh leadership from outside the agency.
Trump is following a long line of presidents before him by naming a key member of his protection team as the agency’s director, rather than choosing someone outside the Secret Service to give it fresh leadership who can revamp and harden its approach to protection.",Trump appoints leader of his Secret Service detail to head agency,"[PASS] (1.00)

"A federal judge on Thursday refused to stop the CIA and director of national intelligence from firing 51 officers who had been assigned to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility roles that were scrapped last month by President Donald Trump. The officers may not appeal to civil service boards, and they may not transfer to other jobs in the intelligence community because agency rules allow the director to fire employees without any recourse.
In three court hearings this month, U.S. District Judge Anthony J. Trenga questioned why the Trump administration decided to fire all of the officials instead of reassigning them, as had been recommended by career-services officials at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
“These are talented, experienced assets, if you will, that would be in the interests of the United States to be reassigned elsewhere, if that need existed,” Trenga said at a hearing Monday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.
But government lawyers said CIA Director John Ratcliffe relied on a regulation particular to the intelligence community stating that “any employee may be terminated from the Agency at any time without regard to any procedural steps … when the [director], in his discretion, deems it necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States.” Assistant U.S. Attorney Dennis Barghaan said that prevented the employees from being reassigned.
Kevin T. Carroll, a lawyer for the fired officers, argued that “in the interest of the United States” meant that the employee was being fired for reasons related to national security, and that there should be individualized findings before anyone is released. But Trenga said the court didn’t have jurisdiction over an administrative claim unless the agency waived its sovereign immunity, and that the officers probably wouldn’t prevail on the issues that their First Amendment right to free speech and their Fifth Amendment right to due process were violated.
“In effect, they are at-will employees,” the judge ruled. “The regulations make it clear they have no property interest in the employment they have.”
As the disappointed officers looked on, Carroll said afterward: “We respect the court’s decision. I would certainly hope, given the judge’s remarks, that Director Ratcliffe would consider allowing the plaintiffs to apply for other jobs.” He said one of the fired officers had eight other job offers within the CIA, as a data scientist, but was prevented from accepting one.
The lawsuit was filed by 19 anonymous intelligence officers who said they had been temporarily assigned to DEI roles within their agencies and were now being scapegoated “in the service of a partisan ideological agenda.” Some of the employees have been on the job for two decades, according to court records. Ten of the employees were in court for Thursday’s ruling, but declined to comment afterward.
Earlier, Carroll said the career intelligence officers had been trained at taxpayers’ expense to perform some of the most sensitive spy jobs — “from source development to recruitment” and “collection to analysis” — and that they were being fired despite being qualified for other open positions at their agencies. Some stand to lose the government pensions they had been working toward for years, the lawyer said.
“None of these officers’ activities was or is illegal, and at no time have the agencies employing Plaintiffs contended that they individually engaged in any misconduct, nor are they accused of poor performance,” Carroll said in a legal filing. Their job duties included “advancing the hiring, promotion and advancement of members of protected classes,” and firing them for performing assigned work would violate their constitutional rights, he said.
According to court records, the officers were placed on administrative leave with pay two days after Trump signed an executive order last month terminating all DEI programs in the executive branch. Weeks later, some of the officers were told to report to their agencies’ visitor centers with their badges and without lawyers. That’s what it looks like when an intelligence community member is about to get fired or placed on leave without pay, one of the anonymous CIA officers said in a court filing.
The intelligence officer defended the need for diversity among the agency’s ranks. Blending in “racially and culturally” among foreign populations is key to intelligence collection, he said. “There are needs for dual citizenship documentation, foreign language skills and/or overseas living experiences,” the officer said, noting that in some cultural settings, women will not meet alone with men.
Justice Department attorneys said in a legal filing that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard had not finalized any plans to fire officers in DEI roles. But Gabbard and Ratcliffe have unqualified authority to fire any of their employees, and Ratcliffe has chosen to use it, the attorneys argued.
Ratcliffe in a court filing said he could terminate any CIA employee under provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, “when, in my discretion, I deem it ‘necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.’ ” Shutting down the CIA’s diversity and inclusion office and firing all its employees met that standard, he said.
The DEI-related firings could affect not just the 19 intelligence officers who sued but a total of 51 employees at the CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence, their attorneys said. At the CIA, they said, the mass ouster “suggests an unlawful effort … to misuse the Director’s unique national security-related authorities to evade federal equal opportunity laws.”
Trenga said he was puzzled by the CIA’s decision not to reassign the officers. Agency regulations state that any employees who are terminated as part of a downsizing should be offered open positions, he said. Justice Department attorneys said Ratcliffe fired the employees under a different regulation that provides no such job protections.
“I frankly don’t quite understand why that’s being resisted by the agency,” the judge said at the hearing Monday. Trenga was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush and presides over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in addition to serving as a federal district court judge in Virginia.

"Native American leaders said they’re worried about the impact of a freeze on federal grants and loans that could affect dozens of programs that provide a range of services including food, health care, education, housing and law enforcement.
The United States has more than 570 federally recognized tribes, and many receive some type of funds to provide programs and services for their tribal citizens through the federal government.
Advocates and leaders in tribal communities said they’re concerned that many tribes are not in a financial position to fully fund their citizens’ needs without federal money.
“Everybody is scrambling in Indian Country,” said Brian Weeden, chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe in Massachusetts, which has about 4,000 enrolled citizens and whose tribe receives grant funds from the federal government.
“Tribes are trying to figure it out,” he said, “and draw down programs to make sure they can stay afloat.”
Josh Arce, president and chief executive of Partnership with Native Americans — a nonprofit group that provides services and aid to more than 150 tribal communities in remote areas of the Southwest and northern plains — said “we’re pretty surprised” about the freeze.
“It’s not something we thought we’d wake up to on a Tuesday morning,” he said, “and it could impact so many things for Native American communities, from road and bridge programs to childhood education and nutrition efforts for the elderly.”
Arce said some tribes use the federal grants for much-needed services, and “if they don’t have the ability to offset the loss, we don’t know what that could look like for continuing essential programs or starting new programs for the year.”
“That means communities that have basic needs could see those needs go unmet,” he said. Programs that pay for firewood or propane gas to heat homes or distribute food could be hurt, he said.",Native leaders warn that freezing of federal funds could imperil some services,"[PASS] (1.00)

"A federal judge on Wednesday extended for three days an order preventing the Trump administration from firing the head of an independent watchdog agency that has sought to pause President Donald Trump’s mass termination of some probationary federal workers.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she wanted more time to consider the lawyers’ arguments before issuing a broader ruling on whether the administration’s attempted ouster of Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, was unlawful. A temporary restraining order barring Dellinger’s firing will remain in place until Saturday, she said.
Dellinger, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sued the administration after he received a one-sentence email earlier this month telling him he was fired from the office, which protects government whistleblowers. He said his termination violated a law that says the president can remove him only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.” Jackson on Feb. 12 ordered him reinstated for two weeks while his case proceeds.
The Trump administration argues that the Constitution allows Trump to remove Dellinger and other agency leaders.
On Tuesday, an independent federal board <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/probationary-employee-firings-trump-musk-doge/"" target=""_blank"">granted a request</a> by Dellinger to halt the administration’s firings of six probationary government employees. Dellinger said the firings of those employees, and potentially many others, were <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/24/hampton-dellinger-special-counsel-filing-probationary-employees/"" target=""_blank"">probably illegal</a>.
In court Wednesday morning, Jackson sharply questioned claims by the Trump administration’s lawyer that Trump had the power to fire Dellinger without cause and that the law prohibiting him from doing so was unconstitutional. Unlike other agency heads, the special counsel was granted independence from the president to investigate potential wrongdoing by the administration, the judge said. Dellinger was appointed to a five-year term that ends in 2029.
“His actual job is to be a check and balance on the president,” Jackson said.
The judge pressed Justice Department lawyer Madeline McMahon to explain why it would be in the public interest to fire Dellinger.
McMahon said barring Dellinger’s removal would cause Trump to “lose control over an executive branch agency” and would represent an “intrusion” into Trump’s authority under the Constitution.",Judge briefly extends order barring Trump from firing watchdog leader,"[PASS] (1.00)

"The Trump administration is expected to begin laying off thousands of employees at the Internal Revenue Service, six people briefed on the matter said, as billionaire Elon Musk’s team begins to target tax collections.
Treasury officials have discussed laying off roughly 9,000 employees still in their probationary period as part of broader dismissals across the government of recently hired workers, according to the six people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal conversations. That number could not be immediately confirmed, and spokespeople both for the IRS and Treasury declined to comment. The cuts could start as soon as Friday.
The layoffs are likely targeting tax collection, several of the people briefed on the matter said. Indeed, associates of Musk’s team are beginning to meet with high-ranking IRS officials about what could prove dramatic changes to the tax agency. Gavin Kliger, a software engineer now working at the IRS, met with Ken Corbin, the IRS’s chief of taxpayer services, and Heather Maloy, the agency’s top enforcement official, during his first day at the agency’s headquarters Thursday, according to several of the people familiar with the meetings.
Republicans have long aimed to shrink the tax agency and were particularly incensed by the Biden administration’s push to hire thousands of new IRS agents to increase tax enforcement and collections. The cuts to federal personnel are likely to weaken the Biden administration’s efforts to bolster the IRS, though to what extent remains uncertain.
The tax agency grew by about 10 percent last year, as its ranks swelled from roughly 90,000 employees in fiscal year 2023 to 100,000 employees this fiscal year. The IRS has said publicly that personnel critical to the tax filing season are ineligible for the “deferred resignation” plan that encouraged federal personnel to quit. That has fueled speculation that the cuts to IRS personnel will be concentrated among the agency’s tax collection staff, which could reduce the amount of revenue brought into federal coffers even as Musk calls for a reduced deficit.
“It’s quite distressing, because the Biden administration made serious efforts to bolster enforcement. I think all of that is in jeopardy now,” said Steve Rosenthal, who served as a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. “Stripping the IRS of resources is a windfall for those who like to game the system, and those are the most sophisticated and richest taxpayers.”
Congressional Republicans are likely to welcome DOGE’s changes to the IRS. On Thursday, Rep. Jason T. Smith (R-Missouri), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, wrote a letter to IRS’s acting commissioner blasting the $80 billion funding increase for the tax agency, among other measures.
“President Trump has shown in his first three weeks that he meant what he said during the presidential campaign. Our government has not been working effectively for the American people, and it needs to change,” Smith’s letter states.
Congress had given <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/06/inflation-reduction-act-irs/"" target=""_blank"">the IRS $80 billion</a> over 10 years through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, but<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/26/irs-funding-cut-20-billion-shutdown/"" target=""_blank""> Congress rescinded $20 billion</a> of that.
Within the agency, the impending job cuts are being met with dread, both for individuals and the health of the tax system. The vast majority of Treasury employees work for the IRS.
IRS employees cheered the Biden administration’s funding boosts, which yielded almost immediate performance and IT improvements. Now rolling those back — and cutting thousands of freshly hired employees — could send the agency into a tailspin in the middle of filing season.
“It’s going to be like going off a cliff immediately,” said David Carrone, a revenue agent and president of the Louisiana-Arkansas National Treasury Employees Union chapter.

"The Education Department announced Friday that it was launching an investigation into a Maine high school and the state’s education agency, after a tense exchange between President Donald Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) over transgender students.
Earlier in the day, Trump warned during a session with the Republican Governor’s Association that Maine risks losing federal funding if it continues to allow transgender students to participate in girls’ sports, despite his executive order aiming to ban that.
Mills responded: “We’re going to follow the law, sir. We’ll see you in court.”
On Friday, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights announced an investigation.
“Maine would have you believe that it has no choice in how it treats women and girls in athletics — that is, that it must follow its state laws and allow male athletes to compete against women and girls,” Craig Trainor, the Education Department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights,<a href=""https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/office-civil-rights-launches-title-ix-violation-investigations-maine-department-of-education-and-maine-school-district"" target=_blank> said in a statement.</a> “Let me be clear: If Maine wants to continue to receive federal funds from the Education Department, it has to follow Title IX.”
Mills responded promptly saying the state was standing firm.
“If the President attempts to unilaterally deprive Maine school children of the benefit of Federal funding, my Administration and the Attorney General will take all appropriate and necessary legal action to restore that funding and the academic opportunity it provides. The State of Maine will not be intimidated by the President’s threats,” Mills <a href=""https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-statement-presidents-threat-withhold-education-funding-maine-2025-02-21"" target=""_blank"">replied in a statement</a>.",Education Dept. launches investigation into Maine over transgender policies,"[PASS] (1.00)

"Lawyers for eight inspectors general suing the Trump administration over their firings last month were forced by an angry federal judge to withdraw their motion seeking a temporary restraining order.
Judge Ana C. Reyes of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia tore into the attorneys for the plaintiffs in a brief but heated hearing on Friday afternoon.
Reyes demanded to know why the plaintiffs’ attorneys waited 21 days after the firings <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/12/trump-fired-inspectors-general-lawsuit/"" target=_blank>to file their lawsuit</a>, only to then seek emergency same-day relief. She ticked off the list of emergency actions that have flooded the federal dockets and then limited the attorneys to “yes” and “no” answers.
She also objected to the plaintiffs’ counsel comparing the facts of their case to those of Hampton Dellinger, the fired head of the Office of Special Counsel who <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/10/trump-office-of-special-counsel-firing-lawsuit/3195b7de-e7ce-11ef-969b-cfbefacb1eb3_story.html"" target=""_blank"">sued the Trump administration last week</a>. Dellinger argued in his complaint that his termination violated a law that shields the leaders of independent agencies from removal by the president. The inspectors general, however, are arguing that their firing was illegal because Trump did not give Congress 30 days’ notice of his decision as required by law.
After forcing the plaintiffs to withdraw their motion for a temporary restraining order, the parties agreed to an expedited schedule. The government must reply to the lawsuit by Feb. 21.
“Why on earth this could not have been decided in a five-minute phone call is beyond me,” Reyes said. She said she considered sanctioning the plaintiff’s attorneys but had more pressing matters on her docket.",Judge forces lawyers for fired inspectors general to withdraw TRO request,"[PASS] (1.00)

"Trump appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency notified staff members Thursday that they plan to close the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, and place 168 of its employees on administrative leave.
“Career staff made determinations on which Office of Environmental Justice employees had statutory duties or core mission functions,” EPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said in an email.
“As such, 168 staffers were placed on administrative leave as their function did not relate to the agency’s statutory duties or grant work,” she added. “EPA is in the process of evaluating new structure and organization to ensure we are meeting our mission of protecting human health and the environment for all Americans.”
The Washington Post also obtained an internal email notifying some division employees about being placed on leave.
One employee in the office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, said that staff members have felt various degrees of fear since Trump’s executive orders targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the government.
“It’s clearly an all-out assault on federal workers, and it’s an all-out assault on the most marginalized communities in the United States and across the world,” the staffer said.

"The Pentagon said Friday that it will fire about 5,400 civilian employees beginning next week in an “initial” purge of its workforce, as President Donald Trump’s hastily issued orders to shake up the Defense Department faced new scrutiny and officials scrambled to understand whether such actions could imperil national security.
The announcement followed a day of uncertainty, as administration officials paused a plan to begin firings now while evaluating requests to retain thousands of other employees deemed essential. A senior Pentagon official, Darin Selnick, said in a statement late Friday that the Trump administration intends to cull its workforce by between 5 and 8 percent. With more than 900,000 civilian employees in the Defense Department, tens of thousands of people could be forced out eventually.
Echoing <a href=""https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1892702578418327972"" target=_blank>a pronouncement</a> made earlier by Trump’s defense secretary,<b> </b>Pete Hegseth, Selnick said in his statement that “it is simply not in the public interest to retain individuals whose contributions are not mission-critical.”
“Taxpayers deserve to have us take a thorough look at our workforce top-to-bottom to see where we can eliminate redundancies,” Selnick added. The cuts are necessary, he said, “to produce efficiencies and refocus” the Pentagon on Trump’s national security priorities.
The firings are not expected to target U.S. troops. The Pentagon oversees about 1.3 million active-duty service members and nearly 800,000 more who are in the National Guard and reserves.
The cuts will come after Trump administration officials, coordinating with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service, have slashed thousands of employees elsewhere in the government as part of the president’s broad effort to dismantle the federal bureaucracy.
The Defense Department’s civilian worker purge is beginning with probationary employees, those who have one to three years of experience or who recently were promoted, according to officials familiar with the matter, who like some others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue’s sensitivity. That pool of people numbers between 50,000 and 55,000, officials said.
After deliberations over the last day, the Pentagon has settled on firing about 10 percent of its probational employees, a defense official familiar with the effort said. A hiring freeze is expected to take hold next week, and administration officials plan to spend two to three months analyzing who else could be ousted, the official said.
Supervisors throughout the department, the federal government’s largest, have spent days requesting of the new administration that certain employees should be spared because the work they do is vital to national defense. An email obtained by The Washington Post indicates that Trump officials ultimately decided they need more time to sort through those many cases.
The message, sent Thursday night by Ruth Vetter, a lawyer in the Pentagon general counsel’s office, said that senior officials had informed human resources staff that “they should not initiate removals of probationary employees” on Friday because requests for exemptions citing mission criticality “are still under review.”
Vetter’s email, labeled “PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL,” warned that an employee’s past performance “must be viewed through the current needs and best interest of the government, in light of the President’s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.”
Vetter referred questions to Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot, who did not respond to requests for comment.
Among the agency’s probationary employees are hundreds of teachers who work for the Department of Defense Education Activity, a school system that educates about 67,000 students — mostly the children of service members — at military installations around the globe. One person familiar with the matter said that DoDEA officials were attempting to save teachers from Trump’s purge of the federal workforce, but it was unclear if the effort would be successful. A DoDEA spokesman declined to comment.
At the Office of Naval Intelligence, which provides senior military officials with maritime threat assessments and related analysis, employees were called to a meeting Thursday at their headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, where they were told that all probationary workers would be terminated, said one intelligence analyst.
The analyst went to work Friday expecting to be out of a job, but was informed that no further instructions had been received. “Don’t get your hopes up too much,” he said he was told.
The analyst, an Air Force veteran, said about 60 people in his office could be fired, and voiced frustration that he and his colleagues are seen by DOGE officials as numbers on a spreadsheet.
“Work is next to impossible right now,” the analyst said. “Morale is through the floor.”
Coinciding with the civilian-worker purge, U.S. defense officials, acting on orders from Hegseth, have undertaken a sprawling effort to compile options for <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/19/trump-pentagon-budget-cuts/"" target=_blank>slashing about 8 percent</a> from each armed service’s budget for each of the next five years. Doing so, Hegseth has said, could yield $50 billion in 2026 to be reinvested elsewhere in the Defense Department, including an expensive missile-defense shield that Trump has taken to calling “Iron Dome For America.”
After news of Hegseth’s directive alarmed lawmakers and defense officials, the former Fox News personality sought to blame the news media for causing confusion about the administration’s efforts and portrayed his plan as a “reorienting” of the Pentagon budget away from “woke, Biden-era nonlethal programs” to “instead spend that money on President Trump’s America First, peace-through-strength priorities for our national budget.”
“It’s not a cut,” Hegseth said in a nearly <a href=""https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1892702578418327972"" target=_blank>nine-minute video</a> posted to social media on Thursday evening. “It’s refocusing and reinvesting existing funds into building a force to protect you, the American people.”
But independent budget analysts said it is highly unlikely that tens of billions of dollars per year can be targeted for reinvestment without slashing some major weapons programs and cutting the number troops in some of the services.
Travis Sharp, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the fiscal 2025 budget under President Joe Biden included $162 million for diversity, equity and inclusion programs and $3.6 billion to build resiliency at Defense Department installations to counter climate change. Even if all of that money is removed from the budget and reprogrammed, he said, it’s a “drop in the bucket” at getting to $50 billion.
To achieve such an ambitious goal, Sharp said, the Pentagon could retire older weapons programs, eliminate newer ones that remain in development, and shrink or shutter individual headquarters and agencies. Similar efforts have been undertaken before, Sharp said, including by Defense Secretary Robert Gates under President Barack Obama, but they still fell well short of Hegseth’s goals.
“What they’re attempting is unprecedented in recent history,” Sharp said.
Mackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said it will take an “all of the above” approach to cut that deeply into existing defense budget to fund new efforts. She noted that in a memo to senior Pentagon officials on Tuesday, Hegseth “walled off” 17 key priorities identified by the Trump administration — including missile defense, submarines, one-way attack drones and border security. So other areas will be especially vulnerable.
“Look, the Defense Department reflects America,” she said. “The largest line item on the balance sheet of most corporations is labor. It’s people. There’s no workforce you can spare. They’re going to have to go after the defense civilian workforce as well as active-duty military end strength.”
Another option the Trump administration could pursue, especially if it seeks to slash billions of dollars in future years for new priorities, is the closure of some existing military bases, Eaglen said. Such efforts — commonly known as base realignment and closure — have been politically unpopular, but could be appealing to Musk, she predicted.
“There is a very compelling case for base closure,” Eaglen said. “If you kind of get into those weeds with people, you can make a rational business case. I actually think Congress could be compelled with a bully [defense secretary] and bully White House.”

"A federal judge on Monday blocked Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service from using private information collected by<b> </b>the Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management.
U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman in Maryland issued a <a href=""https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Dkt-39-Opinion-and-Order-on-TRO.pdf"">temporary restraining order</a> in a lawsuit led by the American Federation of Teachers to stop DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency,<b> </b>from accessing databases containing personal information on millions of Americans. She denied the union’s request to block DOGE from sensitive Treasury Department data because a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/"">preliminary injunction</a> in a separate case achieved that goal.
The order bars the Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management from disclosing personally identifiable information to DOGE affiliates at least until March 10.
“This is a significant decision that puts a firewall between actors who we believe lack the legitimacy and authority to access Americans’ personal data,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers union, which represents 1.8 million workers in education, health care and government.
“When people give their financial and other personal information to the federal government — namely to secure financial aid for their kids to go to college, or to get a student loan — they expect that data to be protected and used for the reasons it was intended, not appropriated for other means,” Weingarten added.
The Education Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neither did DOGE.
The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated the Privacy Act by giving Musk’s team sensitive data for reasons beyond its intended use. DOGE has had<b> </b>access to databases that include home addresses, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers, among other information. The union says such access poses security risks.
In addition to the AFT, the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They are joined by six individuals with sensitive data stored in federal systems, including military veterans who received federal student loans.
The Education Department collects personal information to administer federal financial aid programs. DOGE had gained access to the department’s databases, including Federal Student Aid Partner Connect, the Financial Management System and the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/trump-presidency-news/#link-AFIQUVHY3BF4VHB5UF7HS57W4E"" target=_blank>National Student Loan Data System</a>.
DOGE, according to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/"">previous Washington Post reporting</a>, has been<b> </b>feeding data from across the Education Department into artificial intelligence software to probe the agency’s programs and spending. The effort is part of a push to slash spending and shrink the agency’s staff, as President Donald Trump seeks to dismantle the<b> </b>department.
In the 33-page ruling, Boardman wrote that the government “never explains why” OPM and department personnel need this widespread access to Americans’ private information<b> </b>to carry out the overhaul.
Boardman released the order days after a federal judge in a separate lawsuit <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/18/court-declines-stop-doge-accessing-student-data/"">refused</a> to issue a restraining order to stop Musk’s team from accessing student data at the Education Department, saying<b> </b>there was no immediate threat in allowing it.",Judge temporarily blocks DOGE access to sensitive information at two agencies,"[PASS] (1.00)

"A group of farmers and environmental nonprofits <a href=""https://earthjustice.org/brief/2025/were-suing-to-stop-the-trump-admins-climate-censorship-that-threatens-farmers-and-our-food-supply"" target=""_blank"">sued</a> the U.S. Department of Agriculture, accusing the department of scrubbing data relating to climate change from its website and saying the move would hinder research and hurt farming initiatives.
In a <a href=""https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/usdaclimatewebpagespurgecomplaint_2.24.25_final-1.pdf"" target=_blank>lawsuit</a> filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York (NOFA-NY) and two environmental nonprofits, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group, accused USDA of deleting “climate-related policies, guides, datasets, and resources from its websites” in violation of laws on government transparency and agency action.
The suit said the department’s actions hurt farmers who used the data to plan “agricultural decisions” and access funding, made it more difficult for climate researchers and advocates to do their jobs, and “deprived the public” of “vital information.” USDA websites include the Forest Service, Food Safety and Inspection Service, and Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“USDA should be working to protect our food system from droughts, wildfires, and extreme weather, not denying the public access to critical resources,” <a href=""https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/trump-usda-sued-for-erasing-webpages-vital-to-farmers"" target=""_blank"">said</a> Jeffrey Stein, an attorney at Earthjustice, the legal group that filed the suit.
USDA referred questions from The Washington Post to the Justice Department, which declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Examples cited in the lawsuit include the Farm Service Agency taking down a webpage that <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/federal-agencies-websites-trump/"" target=_blank>told farmers how to apply</a> for climate-smart agriculture and farm loan programs, and the Forest Service deleting an interactive map that allowed users to see where federal agencies have conducted climate change vulnerability assessments and learn more about them.
Earthjustice said the data removal is “part of a trend” under the Trump administration, which has worked to <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/"" target=""_blank"">dismantle climate protections</a> and reverse federal policies aimed at fighting and measuring climate change.
The suit also noted that the order to delete these materials came as farmers were already reeling from the Trump administration’s <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/02/24/usda-trump-dei-executive-orders/"" target=""_blank"">freeze of funding previously promised by USDA</a> under programs aimed at promoting clean energy and sustainable agriculture —  leaving many <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/10/farmers-agriculture-funding-frozen/"" target=""_blank"">farmers on the hook for payments</a> they never expected to make.  Under the Trump administration, thousands of federal employees have been laid off across the country, <a href=""https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/02/layoffs-hit-thousands-of-usda-employees-across-the-country-00204481"" target=""_blank"">including</a> at <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/19/bird-flu-usda-doge-musk-trump/"" target=""_blank"">USDA</a>.
“Taking climate change information off websites, freezing funds, and laying off USDA workers that are helping to protect communities is ludicrous,” said Wes Gillingham, board president of NOFA-NY, which represents  farmers, gardeners and consumers advocating for organic and sustainable food and farming.
According to the suit, on Jan. 30, USDA Director of Digital Communications Peter Rhee told staff members in an email that they had about 24 hours to “identify and archive or unpublish any landing pages focused on climate change,” and instructed them to sort other webpages into tiers based on how much they mentioned climate change and give a “recommendation on how the content should be handled.”
USDA staff members then “acted swiftly to purge department websites of climate-change-focused webpages,” the lawsuit stated — creating confusion and chaos as resources for farmers and the public suddenly became inaccessible, “without any public notice or explanation.”
In recent weeks, government agencies have removed material relating to topics deemed objectionable by President Donald Trump’s administration <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/federal-agencies-websites-trump/"" target=_blank>from their websites</a>, including references to diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as references to climate change and initiatives to combat it.
The lawsuit claimed that in deleting the materials so quickly and without notice, USDA violated the <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-104publ13/pdf/PLAW-104publ13.pdf"" target=_blank>Paperwork Reduction Act</a>, which requires agencies to provide notice when terminating “significant information dissemination products,” and the Freedom of Information Act. The groups also sued under<b> </b>the <a href=""https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10558"" target=_blank>Administrative Procedure Act</a>, which allows people to request judicial reviews of certain harmful agency actions.
The suit asked the court to declare USDA’s actions unlawful and order the department to restore the deleted webpages and not to comply further with the Jan. 30 directive.
<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/presidential-candidates-2024-policies-issues/donald-trump-climate-change/"" target=_blank>Trump has long rejected climate science</a> and in his first term aggressively targeted policies aimed at protecting the environment and lowering planet-warming emissions.

"The acting commissioner of the IRS will announce he is stepping down as early as Tuesday, according to four people familiar with the matter who said the departure is driven in part over his distress about the chaos inflicted on the government by billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service.
Doug O’Donnell, a civil servant who spent several decades at the agency, will depart the administration by the end of the week, said the people, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

O’Donnell’s expected departure comes at a pivotal time for the IRS, which faces a crush from tax filing season and fresh scrutiny from Musk’s team.
The people familiar with the matter said O’Donnell was concerned by many of the moves Musk made on the government, including firing probationary employees. As part of Musk-driven cuts, about 7,000 IRS employees are <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/20/irs-layoffs-trump-firings-doge/"" target=_blank>expected to lose their jobs</a>, a person familiar with the matter has said.

The White House also has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/16/doge-irs-access-taxpayer-data/"" target=_blank>been working on a memorandum of understanding</a> to give DOGE officials broad access to IRS systems, property and databases. The draft would require DOGE to maintain the confidentiality of tax return information, but was still viewed by IRS officials as highly unusual.
O’Donnell’s anticipated resignation was first reported by the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/politics/acting-irs-commissioner-retire.html"" target=""_blank"">New York Times</a>. Spokespeople for the Treasury Department and IRS did not immediately return requests for comment. Efforts to locate contact information for O’Donnell directly were not immediately successful Monday night.
O’Donnell’s exit follows the departure of <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/31/elon-musk-treasury-department-payment-systems/"" target=_blank>David A.

"President Donald Trump sent a memorandum Friday directing agency and department heads across the federal government to review all funding that agencies provide to nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs.
The memorandum claims that many NGOs “are engaged in actions that actively undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people” and that it’s the policy of the Trump administration “to stop funding NGOs that undermine the national interest.”
The memo directs agency heads to “align future funding decisions with the interests of the United States and with the goals and priorities of my Administration.”
The memorandum is the latest in a series of efforts by Trump to scrutinize federal spending on humanitarian efforts and other forms of international aid.
<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/25/trump-abortion-global-gag-rule-mexico-city-policy/"" target=_blank>In some countries</a>, especially less developed ones, NGOs are sometimes the only providers of reproductive health care. Last month, Trump reinstated a policy that restricts access to safe abortions in counties that rely on U.S.-funded programs.
Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem said she would cut off agency funding for NGOs that she said were using federal funds to assist in illegal migration into the United States.

"Providers of the national program Head Start, which provides early-childhood education to children from ­low-income families, say that they cannot access the federal funds they need to keep the program running.
After the Trump administration’s executive order to pause some grants and loans disbursed by the federal government, providers couldn’t access the payment management system they use to request funds and get reimbursement. The White House Office of Management and Budget issued guidance Tuesday that the order was not supposed to impact programs such as Head Start, yet access to funding appears to have been frozen.
These funds — which must be spent within two days of when they are requested — are used to pay for everything from staff salary to utility bills, said Donna Davidson, president and CEO of Easter Seals North Georgia, a Head Start provider.
“If this doesn’t correct itself fairly quickly, we’re going to have to close,” Davidson said. “We are hoping that this was an error, but we’re already on Tuesday, payroll is on Friday. We have to be able to draw down that money to make payroll.”
Closing would mean that staffers, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck, would lose their income, and parents who rely on the program would need to figure out alternative child-care arrangements or stay home from work, Davidson said. So far, she said, providers have gotten no guidance from OMB or the federal Head Start agency offices on when access would be reinstated or what to do in the meantime.",Early education programs can’t access federal funding to pay bills,"[PASS] (1.00)

"The Trump administration has told Congress it is prepared to disavow a long-standing Supreme Court ruling that has preserved the independence of certain government agencies and protected commissioners from being fired without good reason.
The notice to lawmakers this week is another signal that the new president intends to make it easier to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/13/trump-firings-watchdogs/"" target=_blank>purge federal government workers</a> and exert maximum control over the bureaucracy. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has fired government agency watchdogs and officials who protect whistleblowers, in addition to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/28/trump-fire-eeoc-nlrb-board-members/"" target=_blank>members of the boards of<b> </b>three independent federal agencies</a> that oversee swaths of U.S. workers, employers and labor unions.
The board terminations appear to violate laws that protect certain agency leaders from being fired by the president<b> </b>without cause, potentially setting up a test of the boundaries of presidential power before the Supreme Court.
In a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) on Wednesday, the administration outlined its legal defense of the commissioner firings and appeared to be counting on a conservative Supreme Court <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/supreme-court-donald-trump-test-cases-presidential-authority/"" target=_blank>to be receptive to the president’s expansive views</a> of executive authority.
“The Department of Justice has determined that certain for-cause removal provisions that apply to members of multimember regulatory commissions are unconstitutional and that the Department will no longer defend their constitutionality,” acting solicitor general Sarah M. Harris wrote.
Such letters are<b> </b>required by Congress when the administration has decided not to defend a federal statute. It essentially put lawmakers<b> </b>on notice that<b> </b>the administration<b> </b>is willing to urge the justices to overturn the 1935 Supreme Court ruling in <i>Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S.</i>, which has protected members of regulatory agencies<b> </b>such as the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Trade Commission.
The Constitution gives the president the power to remove top executive branch officials for any reason at all, but Congress passed legislation that said those officials may not be fired without cause, an attempt to ensure their independence. The Trump administration’s position would give the president more control over those agencies and essentially treat their leaders more like Cabinet secretaries.
In response, Durbin said members of independent, bipartisan agencies such as the NLRB and FTC, which safeguard consumers and workers, have long been protected from removal at the whim of the president. The Trump administration’s push to overturn a nearly century-old Supreme Court precedent, he said in a statement, is a “striking reversal of the Justice Department’s long-standing position under Republican and Democratic presidents alike.”
The Trump administration’s move drew praise from conservatives such as Ed Whelan, a commentator and distinguished senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. He<b> </b>wrote in his newsletter Thursday that the administration is “rejecting — soundly, in my view — the notion that Congress may limit the president’s ability to remove principal officers of executive-branch agencies.”
But Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor and co-director of the school’s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, said the administration’s position amounted to a power grab with Trump wanting<b> </b>“to get rid of anyone who is not in his thrall.”
“He’s trying to turn the entire federal government into an episode of ‘The Apprentice,’ where he screams ‘You’re fired’ at everybody,” she said, making a reference to the president’s former<b> </b>reality TV show.
In late January, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/05/trump-lawsuit-nlrb-board-members-firing/"" target=_blank>Trump fired Gwynne Wilcox</a>, a Biden nominee on the NLRB whose term was set to expire in 2028. Wilcox filed a lawsuit alleging that her dismissal defied “Supreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies.”
The suit says that while Wilcox “has no desire to aid the President in establishing a test case,” she is also aware “of the fact that, if no challenge is made, the President will have effectively succeeded in rendering” invalid “the NLRB’s protections — and, by extension, that of other independent agencies.”
The NLRB — which oversees unionization votes by workers and adjudicates allegations of labor law violations — has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/21/musk-trump-nlrb-amazon-spacex/"" target=_blank>faced a flurry of legal challenges</a> to its constitutionality over the past year, including by SpaceX and Amazon (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post). Workers are already being affected by Wilcox’s firing, including a group of Philadelphia Whole Foods employees who voted to unionize the same day she was removed.
Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, objected to the union’s win on the grounds that, without Wilcox, the National Labor Relations Board lacks a quorum and therefore doesn’t have the authority to certify the election result. Legal experts said the argument is invalid.
In <i>Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S.</i>, the Supreme Court said Congress could stop the president from firing without good reason a member of the Federal Trade Commission. Specifically, the high court said President Franklin D. Roosevelt could not remove one of the FTC commissioners because of their political differences.
Ever since the Reagan administration, the conservative legal movement has advocated a robust view of presidential power known as the “unitary executive theory” in which the president controls all executive decisions without restraint from Congress. The theory played a role in 2020, when the court ruled 5-4 that the structure of another independent watchdog agency was unconstitutional and that the president could fire without cause the director of the <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-7_n6io.pdf"" target=_blank>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>.
That decision did not overrule the directive in <i>Humphrey’s Executor </i>that Congress can restrict the president’s power to fire officials at “multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power.”
But Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote separately to call for the ruling to be overturned, saying the precedent<b> </b>“poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people.”
It is not clear<b> </b>how many of the<b> </b>other justices would agree with Thomas and Gorsuch if given the opportunity in a future case.<b> </b>The court’s 6-3 conservative majority, with three justices nominated by Trump, last year overturned<b> </b>another long-standing ruling targeted by conservatives<b> </b>that required judges to defer to the reasonable interpretations of agency experts.
Gillian E. Metzger, a Columbia Law School professor who was deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel during the Biden administration, said recent rulings have created openings for presidents<b> </b>to try to increase their authority over agencies.
The Trump administration is “pushing to see how far they can get those to go,” she added, calling the departure from precedent that was signaled in the solicitor general’s letter part of a “very broad effort to hobble and denigrate core institutions of the federal government.”
In her letter to Congress, Harris mentioned three independent, multimember regulator agencies whose commissioners “exercise substantial executive power”: the National Labor Relations Board, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. She<b> </b>said the Supreme Court’s 1935 ruling “prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the Executive Branch who execute the laws on the President’s behalf.”
But the same rationale could apply to other agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. The Supreme Court, legal experts said, may be wary about calling into question the structure of the Federal Reserve, in particular, because of the potential destabilizing effects on monetary policy.
“Where would they draw the line?” asked Patrick Schmidt, a political science professor and co-director of legal studies at Macalester College.

"The Education Department on Monday shut down a large swath of work at the Institute of Educational Sciences, the arm of the department responsible for education research, by unilaterally cancelling at least 90 contracts worth $900 million. The agency is responsible for education research, evaluation of programs and collection of a vast amount of data about American schools.
The vast majority of the work of this agency is done by contractors, so canceling their work will have a significant impact on its ability to function, they said.
The canceled contracts were identified by a team of workers from the Department of Government Efficiency service, known as DOGE. The list includes some functions required by statutes.
Notices to contractors were sent Monday, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak. He said they were canceled “for convenience,” a provision that allows for a contract to be terminated without finding fault.
Madi Biedermann, spokeswoman for the department, said three popular programs run by the research arm of the agency were spared: the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a set of nationally representative tests to measure student progress over time, the College Scorecard and the College Navigator.
Biedermann said the canceled contracts would be rebid in hopes of getting the same or better work done at a lower cost. She said she did not know how or why DOGE concluded that these particular contractors are overpaid or underdelivering.
“The significant amount of money as compared to the outcomes generated for students is not commensurate,” she said. She said they are “looking for vendors to generate better outcomes for students.”
Asked how DOGE workers have the requisite expertise to make these determinations, she said, “The entire goal of DOGE is to cut waste, and they have been trained to identify that.”
Biedermann said 90 contracts worth $900 million were canceled. The second official said the list included 167 contracts.",Ed Dept DOGE team cancels $900 million in research contracts,"[FAIL] (0.00)

"President Donald Trump on Monday signed an <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-the-death-penalty-and-protecting-public-safety/"" target=""_blank"">executive order</a> directing the attorney general to seek the death penalty much more often and to encourage local and state prosecutors do to the same.
Trump also took aim at his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/12/23/biden-death-penalty-commutation/"" target=_blank>commuting the sentences</a> last month of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. Biden commuted their sentences to life in prison without parole. While Trump cannot undo those commutations, he raised the possibility that his administration could encourage local officials to seek new death sentences for them.
Writing in the order, Trump directed his attorney general to examine whether those people could be charged with state-level capital crimes and then “recommend appropriate action to state and local authorities.”
In addition to broadly requesting that the Justice Department seek more federal death sentences, Trump directed the attorney general to seek death “for every federal capital crime” in which a law enforcement officer is murdered or the defendant is in the country illegally.
During Trump’s first term, the Justice Department restarted executions and carried out 13, including some in the days leading up to Biden’s inauguration. Under Biden, the Justice Department imposed a moratorium blocking new executions, but prosecutors also continued to seek new death sentences.
Biden’s action commuting sentences last month left three men on federal death row: the surviving Boston Marathon bomber; the Charleston, South Carolina, church gunman; and the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman, who was prosecuted and sentenced to death during Biden’s term.
Trump has long been a vocal supporter of the death penalty. Capital punishment’s use nationwide has waned in recent decades, with executions and new death sentences plummeting. A Washington Post examination <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2024/death-row-inmates-us-executions/"" target=_blank>last year</a> found that many of the 2,100 people on death row appeared likely to die there without being executed.
Officials in some states have not sought to carry out executions, but in other cases, authorities say they have struggled to obtain the drugs needed for lethal injections. Trump’s order also directs his attorney general to make sure that states with the death penalty have the necessary drugs for lethal injections.",Trump signs executive order seeking more death sentences,"[FAIL] (0.00)

"President Donald Trump said he would soon announce new tariffs on computer chips, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/07/raimondo-trump-chips-reckless/"" target=_blank>repeating a campaign promise</a> that if enacted could have deep impacts on the global tech industry and the geopolitical battle over AI with China.
Trump criticized the Biden administration’s policy of using taxpayer money to subsidize the construction of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing facilities and said that a tariff on importing computer chips would work better at forcing companies to move their factories to the United States.
“They’re not going to want to pay a 25, 50 or even 100 percent tax,” Trump said. “If you want to stop paying the taxes or the tariffs, you have to build your plant right here in America.”
Though the United States is the global leader in designing chips, the vast majority of chip production happens overseas, particularly in Taiwan, where the high-end computer chips necessary for training and running AI models are made.
<b>“</b>They left us and they went to Taiwan,” Trump said. “We want them to come back and we don’t want to give them billions of dollars.”
Trump also said the technical breakthroughs made by Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek should spur U.S. companies to compete harder to maintain the United States’ lead in artificial intelligence technology.
DeepSeek’s AI tech has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/27/deep-seek-ai-markets-nvidia/"" target=_blank>sent shock waves through Silicon Valley and Wall Street</a>, after the company claimed that its AI chatbot that rivals the capability of OpenAI’s ChatGPT cost just $6 million to train, a fraction of what top U.S. AI companies use to develop their programs.
“The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win because we have the greatest scientists in the world,” Trump said.
DeepSeek’s apparent breakthrough in making much more efficient AI could be a positive because the tech is now also available to U.S. companies, he said.",Trump says new tariffs on computer chips are coming,"[PASS] (1.00)

"President Donald Trump on Tuesday is signing an executive order that calls on federal agencies to work with the U.S. DOGE Service in a bid to cut their existing workforce and limit future hiring, a White House official told The Washington Post.
The order calls on agency leaders to limit hiring to “essential” positions, prepare for large reductions in force and reduce backfills after staff departures. The order includes some exceptions, such as allowing more hiring of national security and law enforcement personnel. Semafor <a href=""https://www.semafor.com/article/02/11/2025/trump-moves-to-significantly-reduce-federal-workforce"" target=_blank>first reported</a> that Trump will sign the executive order.
Ahead of the signing, Trump was joined in the Oval Office by Elon Musk, his billionaire ally who is overseeing DOGE, an agency that Trump has empowered to find government efficiencies. Musk praised some federal workers but also criticized the “unelected” bureaucracy in remarks made to reporters in the room.

"Openly transgender service members will be disqualified from serving in the U.S. military and will soon be removed from<b> </b>the ranks, according to a Pentagon memo<b> </b>that marks a significant shift from previous Defense Department policy that prohibited discrimination based on gender identity.
The memo was made public Wednesday as part of a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/18/judge-trump-trans-troops-ban-animus/"" target=_blank>lawsuit filed by LGBTQ+ rights groups</a> against an <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/28/trump-transgender-troops-military-hegseth/"" target=_blank>executive order</a> signed last month by President Donald Trump, which stated that the “medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria” are “inconsistent” with the high standards expected of U.S. troops.
An earlier memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had said that people with a history of gender dysphoria would no longer be able to join the military but that they would be “treated with dignity and respect.” The new memo goes a step further in stating that current service members will be removed if they have gender dysphoria or a history of it.
The memo states that exceptions could be made for transgender service members who directly support “warfighting capabilities” if the government feels it has a “compelling” reason to retain them.
Rights group have decried the push to ban transgender troops and say transgender people have served in the military with distinction for years without issue.
SPARTA Pride, a rights group for transgender troops, said thousands of transgender people are serving in the military and are “fully qualified” for their positions. “No policy will ever erase transgender Americans’ contribution to history, warfighting, or military excellence,” the group said in a statement. “Transgender service members have a unique fighting spirit and will continue to defend the constitution and American Values no matter what lies ahead.”
The memo states that service members who are diagnosed with, have a history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria — a condition that involves feelings of psychological or physical discomfort tied to one’s gender identity — are disqualified from military service. Also disqualified are service members who have been treated for gender dysphoria with hormones or surgery.
The memo directs the secretaries of each branch to identify service members with gender dysphoria within 30 days and to “begin separation actions” within 30 days after that.
The affected service members will be honorably discharged as long as they meet normal conditions and qualify for involuntary separation pay, the memo states. If they voluntarily step down, they will be eligible to be paid twice as much under voluntary separation pay, it said.
The memo also states that the military will no longer pay for any treatments or surgery relating to service members’ gender dysphoria.
Even if a transgender service member obtains a waiver to stay in the military, they will face restrictions, the memo says. They cannot access “intimate spaces,” including changing rooms, bathrooms and showers, reserved for members of the gender they transitioned to. They will also have to meet the same physical<b> </b>standards as those of the sex they were assigned at birth, and their military records will be updated to reflect their sex assigned at birth.
About 4,200 service members have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to a senior defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Trump administration. That figure includes active-duty, reserve and National Guard personnel.
Between 2015 and 2024, the military spent about $52 million on transgender service members’<b> </b>psychotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery and other treatments, the senior defense official said. About 1,000 service members had transition-related surgeries during that period, while about 3,200 received hormone therapy, the official said.
Openly transgender people have been allowed to serve in the military since 2016, when the Obama administration <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/06/30/the-pentagons-ban-on-transgender-service-just-fell-but-the-details-are-complicated/"" target=_blank>repealed a ban on transgender service</a>, citing the value of ensuring that all qualified individuals were able to serve their country in uniform. Previously, the military considered transgender people to be unfit for service.
Obama had also, in 2011, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/military-certifies-repeal-of-dont-ask-policy/2011/07/22/gIQAye15TI_story.html"" target=""_blank"">repealed “don’t ask, don’t tell,”</a> a policy that prohibited openly gay service members from serving, and, in 2015, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/12/03/pentagon-chief-to-announce-how-womens-roles-in-the-military-will-expand/"" target=""_blank"">opened more combat roles to women</a>. In 2016, Rand published a <a href=""https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1530.html"" target=""_blank"">study</a> that found those changes in long-standing policy “had no significant effect on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness” and that concluded there was a “minimal likely impact on force readiness” from allowing openly transgender people to serve too.
In subsequent years, military leaders reported no significant harm from allowing openly transgender people to serve. In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2018, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley told Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) that he had “received precisely zero reports of issues of cohesion, discipline, morale” caused by integrating transgender service members.
During Trump’s first term, the Defense Department effectively prohibited transgender people from joining the military but allowed those already in uniform to stay on. The policy was challenged in court, but the Supreme Court <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-allows-trump-restrictions-on-transgender-troops-in-military-to-go-into-effect-as-legal-battle-continues/2019/01/22/e68a7284-1763-11e9-88fe-f9f77a3bcb6c_story.html"" target=""_blank"">upheld Trump’s partial ban in 2019</a>. The military <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/military-to-begin-enforcing-restrictions-on-trumps-transgender-troops/2019/03/13/cf2a0530-4587-11e9-9726-50f151ab44b9_story.html"" target=""_blank"">began enforcing that policy</a> later that year.
President Joe Biden quickly reversed Trump’s ban in an executive order after taking office in 2021.
Wednesday’s memo, which goes further than the policy implemented during Trump’s first term, was released as part of a <a href=""https://www.glad.org/cases/talbott-v-trump/"" target=_blank>lawsuit</a> filed by GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights on behalf of six transgender service members and two individuals seeking to enlist in the military. The suit alleges that Trump’s ban on transgender service members violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.
The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is considering a <a href=""https://www.glad.org/servicemembers-seek-immediate-block-of-transgender-military-ban/"" target=_blank>motion</a> to block enforcement of the ban until the outcome of the lawsuit is determined.

"Infantry Marines and other U.S. troops have begun arriving at the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, U.S. military officials said Monday, in what is expected to be a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/29/guantanamo-cuba-el-salvador-deportations/"" target=_blank>significant operation to house migrants</a> until the Trump administration sends them to their home countries.

"MEXICO CITY — Mexico extradited 29 alleged drug traffickers to the United States on Thursday, including Rafael Caro Quintero, a prized target long sought in the killing of a U.S. narcotics agent, and two leaders of the hyper-violent Zetas cartel, in a dramatic gesture apparently aimed at heading off crushing economic sanctions, according to U.S. officials.
President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on Mexico next week for what he calls its failure to stop drugs — especially fentanyl — from crossing the border. A high-level Mexican delegation met Thursday with senior Trump administration officials in an effort to hammer out a deal to avoid the economic penalties.
“Twenty-nine, that’s huge! What they’ve done is literally cleaned out the cupboard,” said John Feeley, a former U.S. diplomat who served as deputy chief of mission in Mexico from 2009 to 2012. Normally, he said, extraditions of major capos were handled one by one, often involving long negotiations. But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was “pulling out all the stops” to avoid the tariffs, he said.
The government <a href=""https://www.gob.mx/sspc/prensa/tarjeta-informativa-391650"" target=_blank>did not identify those extradited</a>. But the U.S. Justice Department said in a news release that  they included <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/07/23/mexico-drug-trafficker-caro-quintero/"" target=_blank>Caro Quintero</a>, who was long the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s most-wanted man. He was accused in the murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena in Mexico in 1985. Caro Quintero was freed from a Mexican prison on a technicality in 2013, to the outrage of DEA officials. After years of pursuing the drug lord, Mexican troops finally arrested him again in 2022.
Also sent to the United States were Miguel Ángel and Omar Treviño Morales, according to the DOJ statement.  Their Zetas cartel dominated much of central and northern Mexico starting around 2007. The group was dismantled a decade ago by the Mexican armed forces, but U.S. authorities alleged the brothers continued to run a Zetas offshoot,  the Northeast cartel, from a Mexican prison.
The DOJ release said Mexico carried out the extraditions in response to a recent decision by Trump to designate six Mexican cartels as terrorist groups. The Mexican government did not comment, beyond a brief statement saying the 29 people were sought “because of their ties to criminal organizations” involved in drug trafficking.

Vanda Felbab-Brown, a drug-policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, said the extraditions are “all part and parcel of the package the Mexican government is putting on the table to avoid the 25 percent tariffs.” Mexico also has been alarmed by suggestions from some Trump administration officials that U.S. military strikes should be carried out to weaken the cartels.
While the extraditions were welcome, the U.S. government should instead emphasize a broader demand for law enforcement to actively collaborate with Mexico in rounding up and dismantling criminal networks, Felbab-Brown said.

The Caro Quintero case has long been extremely sensitive for the DEA; U.S. officials at the highest levels had pressed Mexico to find and rearrest him after he managed to leave prison. He is accused of ordering the kidnapping of Camarena, allegedly as a punishment for the agent’s investigations. Camarena’s body was found on March 5, 1985, in a plastic bag on a remote Mexican ranch.
The murder was a central plotline of the Netflix series “Narcos, Mexico.”
Caro Quintero “has spent four decades atop DEA’s most wanted fugitive list,” said the agency’s acting administrator, Derek S. Maltz. “This moment is extremely personal for the men and women of DEA.”
Caro Quintero, 72, was being sent to New York, the  DOJ said. He faces charges of leading a criminal organization and participating in the kidnapping, torture and murder of Camarena. Prosecutors have accused his drug organization of sending tons of methamphetamines, cocaine and heroin from Mexico to the United States from 1980 to 2017.
The Treviño Morales brothers have been indicted in the District of Columbia on charges of “trafficking massive quantities of narcotics into the United States,” Nicole Argentieri, then-head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said in October.
The Zetas were originally formed as an armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. Many of the group’s early members were recruited from Mexican army special-forces troops. The group was known for its extreme cruelty — including beheading its enemies, killing Central American migrants it suspected of alliances with other groups and burning its enemies’ bodies in diesel-fueled fires.
<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-mexico-zetas-kingpins-arrest-is-display-of-new-restrained-style-in-drug-war/2013/07/16/5641c20a-ee32-11e2-bb32-725c8351a69e_story.html"" target=_blank>Miguel Ángel Morales</a>, in his early 50s, started out as a local gangster in the border town of Nuevo Laredo before joining the Zetas. He was known as Z-40. His younger brother, Omar, or Z-42, succeeded his brother as the Zetas leader following his arrest. Omar was himself detained in 2015.
Trump had initially said the penalties on Mexico and Canada would take effect in early February unless those countries drastically curbed the flow of migrants and illegal fentanyl over their borders with the United States. Mexico won a temporary reprieve by sending 10,000 extra National Guard forces to the border. But Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning that <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114076153524132682"" target=_blank>he intended to go ahead with the sanctions</a>.
“Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,” he wrote.
Fentanyl has set off the deadliest drug epidemic in U.S. history. But deaths from overdoses, and quantities of the opioid seized in the United States, have declined over the past year, officials say.

"President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies Wednesday to review all of their regulations and cease enforcing those that do not conform to his political views, intensifying a sweeping deregulatory campaign that could eliminate many of the government’s rules on climate, education, health and labor protections.

Federal officials then must report back to the White House, its budget office and the Justice Department, in a process meant to inform efforts to “rescind or modify” the rules. Trump also set the stage for agencies to terminate any enforcement proceedings that seem to run counter to the administration’s beliefs on federal regulation or policy.
The White House mandate in some ways formalized a process that occurs at the start of every administration, as new leaders take office and look to shape the federal government to their liking. But Trump, in particular, has already exhibited great willingness to push the limits of presidential power to achieve his agenda — eliminating entire agencies, programs and funding streams, even those explicitly authorized by Congress, despite the objections of Democrats on Capitol Hill.
Some of the ideas resemble Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for his presidency prepared by the Heritage Foundation ahead of the 2024 elections.

"Trump in an executive order on Monday directed the revocation of any active security clearances held by John Bolton, his former national security adviser, and the living signatories of a notorious October 2020 letter suggesting that emails purportedly taken from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden could be part of a “Russian information operation.”
The action all together targets 50 former national security officials, including several former directors of the Central Intelligence Agency. Some of the former officials no longer have security clearances, making the impact of the order unclear.
A Bolton representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations, served as Trump’s national security adviser for 17 months, ending in September 2019. In 2020, he published a memoir about his time in the administration that included damaging assessments of the president, portraying him as reckless and unfit for office.
In Monday’s order, Trump claimed that Bolton’s book was “rife with sensitive information drawn from his time in government,” an assertion that the former national security adviser has denied.

"Elon Musk’s demand that all 2.3 million government workers<b> </b>justify their work prompted confusion and resistance on Sunday, as several government agency leaders told their staffs not to reply to a mass email requesting bullet-point summations of their accomplishments.
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard instructed personnel in U.S. spy agencies not to respond, according to the text of an email she sent to the workforce on Sunday, citing the agencies’ sensitive and classified work. Defense Department employees were given similar instructions to not respond, as were FBI personnel<b> </b>and Department of Homeland Security employees.
The latest directives<b> </b>come as employees and leaders alike across the government were caught off guard by an email sent Saturday titled: “What did you do last week?”
It commanded federal employees to “reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,” according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. It gave employees a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time Monday.
The email left many worried, others defiant and still others stunned. The resistance, which grew throughout the weekend, came even from some top administration officials selected by President Donald Trump.
Employees at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency were told definitively to reply — a few hours before DHS sent a note saying the opposite. In some parts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, staffers received instructions to draft a response but not send it yet. At other agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, employees were first given one instruction only to be emailed later to pause and watch for more guidance Monday.
Raising the stakes, Musk warned in a <a href=""https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893386883444437415"">post on X</a> that any employee who failed to respond would be treated as having resigned. But the email sent to workers made no mention of that possible consequence, which lawyers said would be illegal.
Musk’s threat also appears to contradict an <a href=""https://www.opm.gov/media/kfpozkad/gwes-pia.pdf"" target=_blank>assessment released on Feb. 5</a> by the Office of Personnel Management that concluded that any responses to government-wide emails must be “explicitly voluntary.” Yet the weekend email was sent by an address at OPM, which serves as human resources for the entire federal government — and has been largely taken over by Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service.
On Sunday, a Republican lawmaker questioned the viability of the directive.
“I don’t know how that’s necessarily feasible,” Rep. Michael Lawler (New York) said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Obviously, a lot of federal employees are under union contract.”
Many employees at certain agencies cannot disclose information about their work to third parties without explicit authorization, security experts noted. Some warned of security risks if all 2.3 million federal employees are forced to reply to one email server sharing their contact information, their manager’s contact information and details about the work they do.
Worries at intelligence agencies
Concerns ran especially deep among employees of the Defense Department, intelligence agencies and the military, according to messages and interviews with more than 300 federal employees.
“Even if people don’t send classified information, the aggregation of all this information in one place would become classified information, which is a national security violation,” warned one active-duty military officer who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “The military cannot function without the DOD federal workforce. This is a national security issue to treat the workforce this way.”
At the Justice Department, managers were advised late Saturday evening that all employees should be prepared to submit responses to the email on Monday. But rank-and-file FBI employees and staff in at least three U.S. attorney’s offices across the country said Sunday that the last guidance they received from their direct managers was not to reply to the email before receiving further instructions.
In a bureau-wide communication Saturday evening, newly installed FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI would “conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures.”
At the Secret Service, the OPM email prompted a flurry of texts and emails to supervisors among agents and officers about whether they were expected to reveal the sensitive and classified details of their job duties the previous week, according to two people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal communications.
To prevent agents from having to describe classified tasks they perform to protect the president and other high-ranking officials, senior officials initially instructed their subordinate agents to send an example response, beginning with: “This week I accomplished: 100% of the tasks and duties required of me by my position description” and “100% of the work product that my manager and I have agreed to.”
The fifth and final bullet said: “I exceeded expectations in the delivery of the above.”
On online forums, many employees cheered the boilerplate language, before DHS told staff early Sunday evening that no one should respond, including those in component offices such as the Secret Service.

At the State Department, Tibor P. Nagy, acting undersecretary of state for management, said in a message obtained by The Post the department “will respond on behalf of the Department,” adding that “no employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command.”
Similar messages went out to employees at a division within the Air Force, the Defense Information Systems Agency and the National Science Foundation, where the chief management officer said in a note to employees that the NSF did not receive advanced notice or guidance about the email.
Musk stands firm, as directive costs workers time
On Saturday night and throughout Sunday, Musk doubled down on the directive. On X, the social media platform he owns, he stated that the email was necessary to ferret out government employees who are “doing so little work that they are not checking their email.” He claimed, without evidence, that there were “non-existent people or the identities of dead people” pretending to be government workers. Many Republican lawmakers defended the message, arguing it would only take a few minutes to reply.
But it caused uncertainty — and ate up people’s time across the government. In the Air Force department, for example, some supervisors spent their Sundays phoning or texting each one of their subordinates to ensure they had seen both Musk’s email and later guidance saying not to reply to it, according to several employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.
The chaos extended beyond the executive branch. At the Library of Congress, which is part of the separate legislative branch, staff received an email Sunday afternoon saying the OPM note was not meant for them and they should not respond.
Some judges and judiciary staff, who are also not in the executive branch, also received the OPM email, according to a note obtained by The Post from the director’s office of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which staffs the judiciary branch. The message said no action should be taken and that the office would contact OPM about the Musk email.
Other workers and agencies were unsure if the email was real, given its unorthodox timing.
“It is possible that this new message sent outside of normal business hours was sent in error and/or is a phishing attempt,” said an email to some staff from NOAA leadership. “Until such time as we can verify that the message that was received … is authentic, please do not respond.”
The email also prompted defiance from Democrats and angry workers exhausted by Musk’s efforts.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) said in a statement Sunday that Democrats would block Musk in Congress and the courts.
“Elon Musk is traumatizing hardworking federal employees, their children and families,” Jeffries said. “He has no legal authority to make his latest demands.”
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) called the request “absurd” and defended government employees. “If Elon Musk truly wants to understand what federal workers accomplished over the past week, he should get to know each department and agency, and learn about the jobs he’s trying to cut.”
At least one staffer responded to the email with resistance. A worker with the U.S. Geological Survey forwarded the “What did you do last week?” email to his direct supervisors informing them he “categorically” refused to reply.
“There is no way that a team of people will read &gt;2 million responses to this message,” the employee wrote. “Anyone who replies is likely to have their responses fed into some AI woodchipper and used for goodness knows what purpose, legal or illegal.”
He then urged his bosses to defend their employees and “push back on these efforts to harass and intimidate us. We are all watching to see whose side you are on.”
Leaders within a NASA directorate advertised the email as a chance to tout workers’ accomplishments, writing that employees should reply with speed, accuracy and detail.
“In just the next two weeks we have 4 launches and 2 lunar landings with missions that will expand our understanding of the first stages of the Universe,” the NASA email stated. “Every one of you play key roles in these momentous endeavors … and can supply many more than just 5 accomplishments in any given week to showcase our mission.”
But at almost the same time elsewhere within NASA, another group of employees received opposite instructions.
One director wrote, “I recognize there are many concerns already being elevated around the request [including] data that would be sent un-encrypted. … The agency is asking employees to take a pause and wait for additional communication and guidance.”
And on Sunday morning, the NASA directorate that had urged employees to reply reversed its guidance. “Please go ahead and prepare your bullets but do not submit … until you receive further guidance,” a leader there wrote.

Okay, let's see. I need to categorize this article into one of the given categories. The article is about Elon Musk sending an email to federal workers asking them to list their accomplishments, leading to confusion and resistance from various agencies.

First, looking at the main subject: it's about government employees and their response to Musk's directive. The key points are the email from Musk, the instructions from different agencies not to reply, concerns about security and legality, and reactions from officials.

Now checking the allowed categories. Let me go through them:

- Abortion: No.
- AI: Mentioned in the context of fear that responses might be used by AI, but not the main topic.
- Associated Press: Not relevant here.
- Birthright citizenship: No.
- CFPB: Not mentioned.
- Climate: No.
- Crypto: DOGE is mentioned (U.S. DOGE Service), but the article's focus isn't on cryptocurrency.
- D.C.: Maybe, but the issue is about federal workers and Musk's involvement.
- Debt ceiling: No.
- DEI in schools/government: Not relevant.
- Department of Education: Not the main subject here.
- Deportations: No.
- DOGE: The U.S. DOGE Service is mentioned, but again, not the central topic.
- End birthright citizenship: No.
- Eric Adams case: Not related.
- Expanding executive power: Musk's actions might be seen as overreach, but not sure if that's the category.
- Federal funding: Not directly about funding.
- Federal grant pause: No.
- Federal office space: Not relevant.
- Federal worker buyout: No.
- Federal workers return to office: Not about returning to office.
- Federal workforce reductions: Maybe, but the issue is about a directive, not layoffs.
- FEMA: Not mentioned.
- Firing government watchdogs: No.
- Food safety: No.
- Foreign aid: No.
- Foreign policy: Not directly related.
- Gaza: No.
- Government shutdown: The article doesn't mention a shutdown.
- Guantánamo Bay: No.
- Health agencies' communications pause: Not about health agencies pausing communication.
- Health care: No.
- Immigration policy: No.
- Interest rates: No.
- Iran: Not mentioned.
- Islamic State: No.
- Israel: No.
- Jan. 6: Not related.
- Kennedy Center: No.
- NIH: Not the focus here.
- NYC congestion toll: No.
- Other: If none fit, but let's check remaining categories.
- Panama Canal: No.
- Pardons: No.
- Reclassifying federal jobs: Not about job reclassification.
- Sanctions: No.
- Senior government officials ousted: Not mentioned.
- Taiwan: No.
- Targeting political enemies/protesters: Not directly about that.
- Tariffs: No.
- The media: The article is in the media, but the category ""The media"" might not be specific enough. However, the article discusses a situation involving media (The Washington Post) reporting on the event, but the main subject isn't the media itself.
- TikTok ban: No.
- Transgender policy: Not related.
- U.S.-Mexico border: No.
- USAID: Not mentioned.
- USPS: No.
- War in Ukraine: No.
- World Health Organization: No.

Hmm. The article is about federal workers and their response to Musk's email, which was sent via OPM (Office of Personnel Management), which is part of the federal government. However, looking at the categories, there's ""Federal workforce reductions,"" but that's not exactly it. There's also ""Expanding executive power"" if Musk is overstepping, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""Other"" since none of the specific categories seem to fit perfectly.

Wait, but the article is about the federal workers' response and the directive from Musk, which involves the federal workforce. However, the categories don't have a direct match for this scenario. The closest might be ""Federal worker buyout"" or ""Expanding executive power,"" but neither seems right. Alternatively, ""Other"" could be appropriate if no better fit exists.

But let me check again. The category ""Federal workers return to office"" isn't about that. There's ""Federal workforce reductions,"" which is about reducing the number of workers, not about a directive to report accomplishments. ""Expanding executive power"" might relate to Musk's influence over federal workers, but it's unclear if that's the intended category.

Alternatively, since the article discusses the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and its role in human resources for the federal government, which is under the U.S. DOGE Service mentioned, maybe ""CFPB""? No, CFPB is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Not related.

Another angle: The email is sent by OPM, which is part of the federal government's HR. The category might be ""Federal funding"" or something else, but I don't see a fit. Since none of the categories precisely describe this situation, the best choice would be ""Other.""

"President Donald Trump <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/23/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director-trump/"" target=_blank>announced</a> Sunday evening that Dan Bongino — a former New York police officer and Secret Service agent turned right-wing podcaster and prolific conspiracy theorist — would serve as the FBI’s deputy director.
The appointment quickly drew criticism from Democrats and was cheered by Trump allies.
“Trump has chosen grifters to lead the FBI.

"Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. granted the Trump administration’s request late Wednesday to pause a lower court’s midnight deadline for the government to resume nearly $2 billion in foreign aid payments suspended for weeks.
The brief administrative order, which did not address the underlying legal issues, will allow time for a full Supreme Court review.
U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali had given the administration until 11:59 p.m. to fulfill its contractual obligations and restart the payments to organizations whose work in impoverished parts of the world had been stopped since President Donald Trump halted such foreign assistance in late January.
Acting solicitor general Sarah M. Harris, the government’s top appellate lawyer, had <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25546029-24a831/"" target=_blank>asked the Supreme Court to block Ali’s order</a>, which she said had “thrown what should be an orderly review by the government into chaos.”
The lower-court order, Harris wrote, exceeds the judiciary’s authority. The government is “committed to paying legitimate claims for work that was properly completed,” she added. “What the government cannot do is pay arbitrarily determined demands on an arbitrary timeline of the district court’s choosing.”
Roberts gave the global aid organizations challenging the administration’s actions until noon Friday to respond to those assertions.
The request to the Supreme Court marked the second time the new administration has asked the justices to intervene after a lower-court judge blocked Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government. Last week, the high court <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/21/trump-dellinger-fire-supreme-court/"" target=_blank>refused to immediately clear the way</a> for the removal of Hampton Dellinger, the head of an independent watchdog agency, whom Trump tried to fire.
Trump issued the wide-ranging pause on foreign aid shortly after his inauguration. His allies quickly began dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, the $40 billion arm of the government that assists humanitarian work in more than 100 countries. The moves <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/"" target=""_blank"">left millions of people at risk of hunger and illness</a> and thousands of USAID employees without jobs, some stranded in dangerous places around the world.
Two groups — the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council — filed suit. On Feb. 13, Ali, a Biden appointee who has been on the bench only since December, issued a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/14/usaid-trump-farmers-food-for-peace-kansas/"" target=_blank>temporary restraining order</a> prohibiting the administration from stopping the aid payments.
But in the days that followed, advocates alleged in court, administration officials openly defied the order, continued to lay off thousands of staffers and contractors, and started terminating thousands of grants that did not fit the administration’s “America First” agenda.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio had earlier exempted some of the relief programs from the pause for work deemed “lifesaving.” But a key payment system has remained largely offline, which has left aid partners without enough cash to continue their work and stranded thousands of pounds of food and medicine far from the communities desperate for help.
On Tuesday, Ali gave officials his deadline for restarting payments. The Trump administration immediately appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, saying that disbursing nearly $2 billion payments would take weeks.
Three hours before Ali’s deadline, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit<a href=""https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/orders/docs/2025/02/25-5046LDSD.pdf"" target=_blank> turned away</a> the administration’s request, saying it does not have the right to appeal at this early stage of the litigation before the U.S. district judge has finished his work.
At that point, the solicitor general’s office had already asked the Supreme Court to intervene.
Harris told the justices that the government cannot function and the president cannot carry out his duties over foreign affairs if “a district court can appoint itself the claims-processor for the federal government and second-guess the Executive Branch’s determinations.”
On Wednesday, the plaintiffs alleged that a small number of Trump’s political appointees, acting at the direction of Trump adviser Elon Musk, were refusing to authorize or vetoing the back payments to foreign aid.
A Trump administration official said via email Wednesday evening that the State Department and USAID had just completed a review of its programming, identifying nearly $4.4 billion in grants for elimination. Nearly 5,800 awards were targeted for elimination as part of “the America First agenda,” the official said.
USAID retained critical awards, including food assistance, lifesaving medical treatments for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, and support for nations like Lebanon, Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba, the official said.
The review had been ongoing when Ali “intervened” in the process, the official added, and the State Department and USAID moved “rapidly to complete the programmatic evaluation,” lifting stop-work orders for some programs and terminating others.
Aid groups and contractors told The Washington Post on Wednesday that they were receiving government notices of thousands of aid projects being terminated, despite the federal judge’s ruling that foreign assistance should continue.

"The Trump White House<b> </b>and Treasury Department officials have agreed to prohibit the U.S. DOGE Service from accessing personal taxpayer data, according to two people familiar with the arrangement, heading off a brewing privacy<b> </b>crisis at the tax agency.
Gavin Kliger, a software engineer with Elon Musk’s DOGE effort assigned to the IRS, will have read-only access to anonymized tax data, the same access granted to academic researchers and IT professionals who work on IRS systems, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details of the agreement.
DOGE, which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, over the weekend requested broad access to the most sensitive IRS data systems, which would have given Kliger the ability to see and in some cases edit detailed information — including bank accounts, payment balances, Social Security and other personal identification numbers and, in some instances, medical information — on virtually every individual, business and nonprofit in the country.
White House officials argued that access was necessary to fulfill DOGE’s charge of rooting out government waste. But that information is some of the most heavily guarded data in the federal government. Political officials do not have access to the Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS. The IRS’s commissioner, national taxpayer advocate and even senior officials in the office of the chief information officer do not have IDRS access either.
The IRS was prepared to reject the White House’s request, the people said, on the grounds that allowing DOGE to have the information would put millions of taxpayers’ information at risk. But over the course of the week, Treasury officials recognized the broad nature of DOGE’s request and agreed to limit Kliger’s access, the people said.
Representatives for the White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
DOGE has sought entry to several highly sensitive data systems across the government. The group sought access to the Treasury Department’s payment systems; the career official who was in charge of that program resigned rather than grant the request. He was later replaced by a DOGE staffer on assignment to Treasury.
DOGE is also attempting to gain access to Social Security Administration datasets, which include the world’s largest repository of medical data and years of history on social safety net payments and employment histories. The acting Social Security administrator resigned late last week after clashing with DOGE officials over that request.",Treasury agrees to block DOGE’s access to personal taxpayer data at IRS,"[PASS] (1.00)

"President <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/"" target=_blank>Donald Trump</a> fired Susan Tsui Grundmann, who until Tuesday served as chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, a White House official confirmed.
Grundmann’s firing from the agency tasked with overseeing public-sector unions appears to violate federal law that protects the agency’s board members from removal by the president without cause. In recent days, Trump has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/28/trump-fire-eeoc-nlrb-board-members/"" target=_blank>also taken the extraordinary step</a> of firing members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
The unprecedented wave of firings appears to contravene a 1935 Supreme Court ruling that shields the leaders of independent agencies from removal by the president “except in cases of neglect of duty, malfeasance or inefficiency.”
Grundmann’s term was set to expire in July.
A White House official said about the firing that Trump is committed to building a team that advances his “America First” agenda.
Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers’ union, said in a statement that Grundmann’s termination was “one more piece of evidence demonstrating this administration is engaged in a continued, unlawful attack on federal workers.”",Trump fires Federal Labor Relations Authority member,"[PASS] (1.00)
