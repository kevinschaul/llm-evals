Noem: Guantánamo Bay on the table to house deportees,"Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem signaled Wednesday morning that the Trump administration is considering using the Guantánamo Bay detention camp to house undocumented immigrants whom officials are seeking to deport.
Asked directly whether Guantánamo Bay was an option for sending undocumented immigrants apprehended by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Noem told Fox News’s “Fox &amp; Friends” that President Donald Trump and his administration are looking at all their options for expelling people who are in the United States illegally, particularly those from countries that do not currently accept deportees, such as Venezuela and Cuba.
“We’re evaluating and talking about that right now. It’s the president’s decision, but it’s an asset, and we’re going to continue to look at how we can use all of our assets to keep America safe,” Noem said.
Guantánamo Bay is known for its military prison within the naval base on the coast of Cuba, where suspected terrorists have been held in the years since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It also has a separate migrant processing facility, which the Biden administration used to process some asylum seekers.",True
Medical evacuations from Gaza slow amid uncertainty over right of return,"DOHA, Qatar — For many Palestinians with critical injuries or chronic illnesses, a medical evacuation out of the Gaza Strip is the only way to access lifesaving care. But now, after President Donald Trump proposed to empty Gaza of its inhabitants, aid workers and doctors say they fear that those leaving the territory could be forfeiting their ability to one day return home.
Inside Gaza, the evacuations have slowed for a range of reasons, including this uncertainty and tightened security checks, according to doctors and aid workers. At the same time, fewer countries are accepting evacuees, a development that aid workers say could partially be a result of fatigue more than a year into the crisis but that also reflects the growing fear that those who leave will not be allowed to return.
All of this means a longer wait for families with injured loved ones. But doctors who have worked in Gaza’s hospitals say many of the people awaiting medical evacuations don’t have time.
Amira Nimerawi, an advocate and aid worker with Health Workers for Palestine, said she’s struggled, knowing that some of the people she has helped to leave Gaza may not be able to go back. “Both personally and professionally, it is an uncomfortable position and infuriating,” she said.
But as a humanitarian worker, she said, her priority will always be delivering lifesaving aid. “How many more children or other people are we going to lose from preventable conditions? There’s a huge number of people who have died because of lack of access,” she said.
Since war between Israel and Hamas broke out in October 2023, the need for medical care outside Gaza has ballooned. The World Health Organization says 25,000 people in Gaza are in need of medical evacuation, including 2,500 children who need urgent attention for war wounds and for chronic diseases like cancer that cannot be treated in the territory.
During the early months of the war, medical evacuations happened regularly. Between November 2023 and May 2024, some 4,900 wounded or critically ill people were transported out of Gaza for treatment in neighboring Egypt and farther afield in the Persian Gulf, Europe and even the United States. But since then, thousands of severely wounded and chronically ill Palestinians have been trapped inside Gaza after its Rafah border crossing with Egypt was shut by Israeli military operations eight months ago.
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have accepted the vast majority of injured and sick Gazans since the war began. About 2,300 patients and family members are in Abu Dhabi, and some 2,500 people are in Doha, according to foreign ministry tallies. Tens of thousands of Gazans have crossed into Egypt since the fighting erupted, many but not all seeking medical treatment. Last week, Jordan’s King Abdullah II pledged that his country would accept 2,000 sick children from Gaza, but it is unclear when those evacuations will occur.
Mimi Syed, an emergency medicine doctor, treated some of the children who are now waiting for medical evacuations from Gaza. She said many of them need repeated surgeries as they recover from gunshot wounds, severe burns or amputations, procedures that would be considered “simple” at the hospital where she practices in Washington state.
“Many of these kids are kids who, if they lived in the United States, would be able to lead normal lives,” she said. But, she said, because of the lack of medical facilities and the high risk of infection in Gaza, delayed treatment “is a death sentence.”
Initially, the ceasefire reached last month between Israel and Hamas gave doctors like Syed hope that medical evacuations would ramp up. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Rafah was to be reopened for medical evacuations, starting with 50 patients a day plus their caregivers.
But evacuations have been bedeviled by several issues. Tightened security checks by Israel and Egypt, and strict rules governing who can accompany the wounded as caregivers, have slowed the issuing of permits to depart Gaza. And citing overwhelmed medical facilities, Egyptian authorities have limited the number of people they are willing to take. Aid workers and doctors say that on most days there are fewer than 50 patients evacuated, and on some days no one gets out.
“Honestly speaking, any child who needs it should be able to get out through this process. But unless you see a foreigner, or somebody connects you to an NGO, or you somehow get on the news, it’s very, very difficult,” said Ayesha Khan, a Stanford University doctor who also recently volunteered in Gaza.
Four-year-old Mira Dreni, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head in August, is one of the children waiting for a medical evacuation. Doctors in Gaza were able to save Mira from the initial injury, but because she is still growing, the hollow surgical tube placed in her brain to help keep her alive needs to be replaced, a procedure that medical facilities in Gaza cannot perform.
Mira’s application for a medical evacuation has been pending for months, and her mother, Israa Haboush, said the last update she received from the World Health Organization was that they were still awaiting Israeli security checks.
For injured children, both the child and a family member must be approved for travel. Male relatives are most frequently denied security approval, and those individuals denied are not informed why, according to aid organizations. Syed, the doctor from Washington state, said that in some instances, the rules limiting one caregiver per patient are separating families.
“What it’s doing is it’s forcing parents to make a decision between leaving their children behind or getting care,” she said. These decisions are all the more agonizing because of heightened uncertainty about their ability to return since Trump proposed displacing all Palestinians from Gaza.
Suhad Khateeb, who left Gaza for Doha with her two youngest sons for emergency treatment, said she never would have expected to still be separated from her husband a year later.
She said the first few days after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike were a frantic blur. Khateeb’s 4-year-old son, Wissam, was inside the house when it was hit. The building partially collapsed, and Wissam suffered injuries to his head and face so severe that doctors at the first hospital she took him to refused to give him a bed.
“They thought he would die immediately. I had to beg for a blood transfusion,” Khateeb said. Once he was stabilized, she got seats in a United Nations convoy traveling to southern Gaza. From there, she was transferred to a hospital in Egypt and a few weeks later to Doha, where her son finally got specialized treatment.
Since then, Wissam has made a remarkable recovery, she said. When they first arrived, he had lost the ability to speak because of the swelling around his brain. Now he’s begun walking a bit on his own. Khateeb and her sons live in a compound outside Doha initially built to house athletes during the 2022 World Cup.
Now, the rows of neat apartment blocks are full of Palestinian families. In a central courtyard, groups of children run and play despite carrying scars from a war more than 1,000 miles away: severe burns, amputated limbs, missing digits.
Khateeb dismissed Trump’s comments about emptying Gaza as “crazy talk, dreams.” But when asked about her future, she acknowledged that she cannot return to Gaza until Wissam is fully healed — and that could be years away. She said her decision to leave her husband and older children fills her with such overpowering sadness that for days at a time she can’t eat.
Other Palestinians in the compound describe similar feelings. Yehya al-Ustaz, 68, suffered two broken legs when his home in Gaza was hit by an airstrike and now relies on a wheelchair.
He said he’s been horrified by images of the destruction in the enclave. “An earthquake would have been kinder.” But he said, “Nothing is like Gaza. Ultimately, Gaza is home. That’s it.”

"Cherry blossoms will be at peak March 28-31, Park Service says","The National Park Service predicted Thursday that D.C.’s iconic cherry trees will reach peak bloom from March 28 to March 31.
Peak bloom is declared by the agency when 70 percent of the blossoms around the Tidal Basin — the reservoir on the National Mall — have opened. Organizers expect 1.5 million people to visit the flowering trees during this year’s National Cherry Blossom Festival.
The festival, which commemorates the 3,000 cherry trees Japan gifted to the United States as a symbol of friendship in 1912, will run from March 20 through April 13. The event — featuring an opening ceremony of Japanese performers, a parade along Constitution Avenue, live music at the Tidal Basin and a kite festival on the Washington Monument grounds — kicks off spring.
“It’s really one of <i>the</i> traditions of the nation’s capital,” said Mike Litterst, a spokesperson for the Park Service. “It’s that sign that spring is finally here. It’s sort of that one unifying thing that occurs in D.C. It’s not blue, it’s not red; for the few weeks that the trees are out, everybody is all about the pink.”
This year marks the first cherry blossom season when construction will be underway to rehabilitate the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/dc-low-lying-city-flood-risks/"" target=""_blank"">crumbling sea walls</a> around the Tidal Basin and West Potomac Park. The three-year renovation is part of a nearly $500 million project to improve infrastructure on the National Mall before the 250th anniversary of American independence in 2026.
Litterst said visitors should expect construction between the Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt memorials, typically prime real estate for cherry blossom viewing.
“Folks will find fencing, they’ll find screening in places, but all of the walkways are open, the roads are open and, most significantly, there will still be plenty of cherry trees in bloom,” Litterst said.
Last year, the Park Service <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/13/cherry-trees-cut-down-washington/"" target=_blank>removed 158 cherry trees</a> for the project — including the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/05/24/stumpy-removed-tidal-basin/"" target=_blank>much-loved Stumpy</a> — but Litterst said more than 2,500 trees remain around the Tidal Basin, with roughly 1,000 more on the Washington Monument grounds and in East Potomac Park.
The Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang independently estimates peak bloom and <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/02/26/dc-cherry-blossom-forecast-2025/"" target=_blank>predicted this year</a> that the blossoms will reach peak bloom between March 23 and 27, about five days earlier than normal.
According to the Capital Weather Gang, climate change has spurred D.C.’s iconic trees to flower earlier over time. The blossom’s average peak has advanced about a week over the past century, from April 4 to March 29, with last year’s March 17 peak bloom tying for the second-earliest on record. March 15, 1990, was the earliest record peak bloom.
City leaders, including D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, and National Cherry Blossom Festival organizers gathered at an annual news conference Thursday at the Waldorf Astoria in downtown D.C. to announce the peak bloom prediction.
Diana Mayhew, president of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, credited the event for making D.C. “the springtime destination,” in an interview ahead of the event. Last year, she said 1.6 million people — 46 percent from the D.C. area and 54 percent tourists — flocked to the nation’s capital to witness the beauty of the blossoms. The festival generated $202 million in visitor spending in D.C. last year, Mayhew said.
City leaders have hoped in recent years that the cherry blossoms could be a catalyst for tourism and reinvigorating the city’s struggling downtown since the pandemic.
But Mayhew, who has organized the festival for 25 years, added that it’s important to her that the celebration is not only for tourists. To “roll out the pink carpet for everyone,” she said, festival organizers have launched community outreach programs and partnerships in all eight D.C. wards. Many of the initiatives focus on youths, including a program that sends local artists to lead workshops at D.C. schools and the “Kites in the Classroom” program, which encourages elementary-schoolers to design, build and fly their own kites as an extension of the Blossom Kite Festival.
On Thursday, Mayhew also said the festival would include a new event to “to keep Stumpy’s spirit alive.” The first Stumpy’s Petals and Paddles boat race will take place on March 20 at the Tidal Basin.
“Spring is such a joyous time here in D.C.” Mayhew said.",False
Fact Checker: The White House’s wildly inaccurate claims about USAID spending,"As the Trump administration this week dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, the primary vehicle for U.S. foreign aid, the White House issued a statement justifying its actions.

Hegseth to visit Guantanamo Bay as migrant detention takes shape,"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to visit the naval base at Guantánamo Bay as soon as Wednesday as the Trump administration’s effort to detain migrants there continues to take shape, two military officials familiar with that matter said.

Administration officials, seeking to project strength, put them in a prison at Guantánamo Bay that has been used to house suspected terrorists after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, saying that an initial wave was all from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

‘You are not alone’: U.S. Forest Service chief’s blunt goodbye message to workers,"The head of the U.S. Forest Service announced his retirement in a blunt, emotional email to staff Wednesday, after thousands of employees <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/17/trump-fires-federal-workers-performance/"" target=_blank>were let go</a> from a department that oversees nearly 200 million acres of American woods and grasslands.
“The past several weeks has been incredibly difficult,” Forest Service Chief Randy Moore wrote in the email, which was also <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/leadership/note-reflection"" target=_blank>posted</a> on the agency’s website. Thousands of Forest Service employees have been fired amid President Donald Trump’s effort to downsize the federal government, led by billionaire Elon Musk’s <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/25/doge-administrator/"" target=_blank>U.S. DOGE Service.</a>
“If you are feeling uncertainty, frustration, or loss, you are not alone,” Moore wrote. “These are real and valid emotions that I am feeling, too. Please take care of yourselves and each other. I have been silent these last few weeks because these decisions are being made at a level above our organization, and I was and am learning about the changes the same time as many of you.”
The Agriculture Department, which oversees the Forest Service, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Feb. 14, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins <a href=""https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/14/secretary-rollins-takes-bold-action-stop-wasteful-spending-and-optimize-usda-better-serve-american"">said</a> in a statement that she welcomed the efforts of DOGE “because we know that its work makes us better, stronger, faster, and more efficient.”
Moore, the first Black chief of the Forest Service, said in his email that he had worked for the organization for 45 years. He has <a href=""https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/people/chiefs/randy-moore/"">held</a> its top post since 2021. His retirement was met with mixed emotions from current employees.
“He’s been the soul of the Forest Service,” said one staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. “The agency is diminished with his departure.”
But one employee said Moore did not push hard enough for better pay at the agency.
“A lot of Forest Service folks are not sad to see him go,” the employee said. “But sometimes it’s the devil you know versus the unknown.”

Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) wrote in a Feb. 14 letter to Rollins. “While reports suggest that public safety employees were not part of the mass firing, positions that support forest management were included.”
In his departure note, Moore acknowledged there may  be more challenges ahead.
“The workforce will continue to be unsettled for a while,” Moore wrote. He added, “As I end my career and reflect on it, I am validated in knowing and believing that the Forest Service is about its people and its worthy mission.”

Musk throws cold water on funding for Trump AI initiative,"Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO and top ally of President Donald Trump, is casting doubt on the funding source for a massive artificial intelligence project that Trump announced Tuesday.

N.Y. Mayor Eric Adams pushes for permanent dismissal of his corruption case,"NEW YORK — Mayor Eric Adams’s attorney argued Wednesday that the case against him should be dismissed permanently, alleging that leaks of a former top prosecutor’s resignation letter discussing the indictment prevented any future fair trial.
The motion filed by Adams lawyer Alex Spiro argued that the mayor’s right to a fair trial was tainted by former acting U.S. attorney Danielle Sassoon’s leaked Feb. 12 letter that said the case was strong and that her office was prepared to file additional charges for obstruction.
Sassoon also said she believed a quid pro quo existed between a top figure at the Justice Department and Adams, and that the mayor committed to help with President Donald Trump’s immigration efforts in exchange for seeing his case dismissed.
Adams and the Justice Department have denied a quid quo pro exists, but the ordeal and the government’s decision to abandon the public corruption matter have drawn an immense amount of controversy.
Acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove argued in court last week without offering proof that the case was politically motivated and would interfere with the 2025 mayoral election. Bove asked Judge Dale Ho to dismiss the case “without prejudice,” which would leave open a possible future revival of the matter.
Spiro argued in his letter to Ho on Wednesday that the case should be dismissed “with prejudice” instead, because “the government’s conduct has destroyed whatever presumption of innocence Mayor Adams had left.”
Ho cannot ultimately deny Bove’s request, but he did not immediately toss the case. He instead assigned an independent lawyer to evaluate arguments against the government’s dismissal request.",True
GOP lawmakers scramble to protect foreign aid as food relief languishes,"As GOP lawmakers in Washington try to protect a key food aid program from the Trump administration’s cutbacks, international humanitarian organizations say the ongoing disruptions<b> </b>in assistance are devastating countries that are on the verge of famine.
The administration’s move in late January to gut the U.S. Agency for International Development — <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/01/foreign-aid-freeze-state-department-usaid/"" target=_blank>laying off thousands of workers</a> and freezing funding<b> </b>in more than 100 countries — immediately jeopardized Food for Peace. For more than 70 years, the $2 billion program has purchased surplus commodities from American farmers for distribution overseas.
Late Thursday, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered administration officials to temporarily lift their freeze on U.S. aid and development programs abroad. He alluded to the “shockwave” caused by their action and said they “have not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid … was a rational precursor to reviewing programs.”
President Donald Trump and top adviser Elon Musk, a tech billionaire, have been highly critical of USAID’s work, with Trump baselessly claiming the agency had committed “tremendous fraud.” 
Despite a State Department waiver for emergency food assistance, those shipments still had been delayed around the world, a USAID inspector general wrote in a report Monday — <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/11/trump-fires-usaid-inspector-general/"" target=_blank>a day before he was dismissed</a>. The bottleneck, Paul K. Martin wrote, put more than $489 million in food assistance at risk of spoilage or theft as it waited at ports, in transit and in warehouses.
In defending itself in court, Ali noted, the government acknowledged that the waiver process “may have had ‘hiccups.’”
Aid groups had said Thursday that some food deliveries were starting to move through shipping channels but that millions more pounds of corn, lentils and pinto beans remained stuck because the agency’s payment system was not functioning.
The waiver for lifesaving assistance that was in place before the judge’s order was “theoretical” because “the payment system that reimburses partners for expenses they incur is offline,” said Sarah Charles, former head of USAID’s Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, which oversaw the Food for Peace program. Some relief agencies are still owed for services rendered in December and January, she added.
At a contentious meeting at the State Department, the Trump appointee tasked with overseeing USAID — or what is left of it — had assured aid workers and congressional staff that aid payments would resume early next week. But Peter Marocco also said that a department review of the agency’s remaining projects was underway and that those that do not “give the president real influence” will be cut, according to a readout of the event obtained by The Washington Post.
A department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Complicating the administration’s narrative is a growing tide of Republican lawmakers and former officials who say it’s not quite accurate.
Andrew Natsios, who served as USAID administrator during the George W. Bush administration, told lawmakers this week that even those relief organizations already granted waivers haven’t been able to “issue checks” and keep working because of the shutdown of USAID’s payment system.
That includes Christian humanitarian groups, which receive $1 billion a year, Natsios said at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing<b> </b>Thursday. The session was meant to highlight what Trump and his allies say is USAID’s wasteful spending but instead underscored concerns about the flow of critical assistance, as two of the three expert witnesses warned of dire consequences for U.S. interests and national security if the aid did not resume soon.
Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), who has urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “quickly ship and distribute” the American-grown food assistance, is among those questioning what’s happening on the ground.
Moran said the State Department last weekend had notified participating groups that they could restart operations. He is skeptical that there has been much impact so far. “My impression is that waivers were granted, but then it doesn’t seem like it was making a significant difference,” he told The Post.

He is working with Rep. Tracey Mann (R), a fellow Kansan, and other lawmakers to protect Food for Peace by moving it to the U.S. Department of Agriculture as “part of an ongoing effort to save money and increase efficiency,” Moran said in a statement. That proposal has gained widespread support from agricultural groups.
Founded in Kansas, Food for Peace was signed into law in 1954 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It has long been championed by the state’s leaders, including former senator Robert J. Dole, and has helped more than 4 billion people in over 150 countries since its inception.
The program is a source of pride for farmers. But it has been criticized over the years for various issues, including the potential to undermine local agriculture in recipient countries and exacerbate conflicts in war-torn areas, according to Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute.
Even if the lawmakers prevail, the program’s ultimate survival is not guaranteed.
Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, pointed to the USDA’s new secretary. Brooke Rollins, former head of a conservative Texas think tank, was confirmed Thursday.
“What happens if she goes into this office cleaning house?” Levendofsky asked. “And what about when Elon Musk comes over to USDA? Anything is to be expected at this point.”
Kansas is the country’s biggest grower of sorghum, and millions of bushels of the high-protein grain are backed up in warehouses across the state. Kim Barnes, chief financial officer of the Pawnee County Cooperative Association, a grain trader in central Kansas, said he’s storing more than 1.3 million bushels of sorghum because of a market downturn over the last year — a situation that will only worsen with USAID cutbacks.
It’s a shame, he said, adding: “There are still countries that need it.”
On Thursday, a different federal judge <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/13/usaid-workers-trump-leave-ruling/"" target=_blank>extended a block</a> on the Trump administration’s plan to place thousands of USAID employees on leave. But with thousands of contractors already<i><b> </b></i>fired, the agency’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance could ultimately lose more than 90 percent of its workforce, Martin, the inspector general, wrote. That outcome exacerbates concerns about whether any existing staff can work with locals on the ground to distribute the commodities, he added.
The <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/"" target=""_blank"">temporary gap in supplies has been “devastating”</a> some countries, said Paul Spiegel, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health and former chief of public health in the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
“There has already been much damage done that will be difficult to undo,” Spiegel said Friday. “The administration has not always done what they said they would do providing exceptions for humanitarian response, so the question remains: Will they allow funds to go out, or will they simply slow it down and the pain and suffering of all these vulnerable people around the globe will continue?”
Duaa Tarig, who worked as an art curator in Sudan before war broke out, said she personally knew three people who recently died of malnutrition in her Khartoum neighborhood.
The pattern is familiar. During a 10-day period last year, many died when soup kitchens in the city were forced to shutter for lack of funding, she recounted. Weakened by starvation, individuals succumbed quickly to malaria or dengue fever.
With USAID funding curtailed, more than 80 percent of those soup kitchens have closed again, she said. Many of those remaining open are unable to afford the lentils they usually buy and are scraping together vegetable soups.
“Everyone, including myself, have lost a lot of weight. Some have lost more than half their body weight. I see the faces of people I used to know and I can’t recognize them — they are just bone and skin,” she said.

"DOGE rips through Education Department, cutting contracts, staff and grants","The notices popped into email boxes all over the country Monday afternoon, notifying researchers who collect, analyze and study data on the American education system that their contracts were terminated, effective immediately. No reason was given.
The nixed contracts support the Institute for Education Sciences at the Education Department, known as IES,<b> </b>and inside the agency, staff questioned whether the cuts were legal, much less justified.
But the decisions were not made by the institute’s leaders or education experts. Rather, the canceled contracts were all on a list drawn up by a U.S. DOGE Service team that is working to unravel the Education Department, stripping the agency of staff, terminating contracts and — soon — canceling program grants, according to people familiar with DOGE activity who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs.
“We’re completely crippled,” said one IES employee. “It really prevents us from serving the mission we thought we were carrying out.”
President Donald Trump has made clear he <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/"">wants the Education Department shuttered</a>. Absent congressional action to do that, his administration is at work dismantling it on its own.
On Wednesday, at least 50 recently hired employees who were on probation were abruptly dismissed without cause across the department, according to union leaders. Staff have been warned that layoffs are coming. And managers inside the agency have been instructed to identify workers who can be converted to a new job status that would strip them of some worker protections, according to a person with direct knowledge of the order.
In addition, DOGE caused about 100 Education Department employees to be put on administrative leave for their <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/10/education-department-dei-devos/"">mostly tangential</a> connections to diversity, equity and inclusion<b> </b>programs, based on <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/22/dei-federal-employees-trump/"">Trump’s executive order</a> to rid the federal government of DEI offices and initiatives. And in <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/"">an executive order</a> Tuesday, Trump instructed departments heads across the government to hire no more than one employee for every four employees who depart, and to plan for mass layoffs.
“The inmates are running the asylum, and the goal is chaos and the goal is destruction,” Arne Duncan, who served as education secretary in the Obama administration, said in an interview. “We’ve never seen anything like this in our lifetime.”
On Friday, the department announced another round of cancellations: $336 million in canceled contracts for Regional Educational Laboratories, which help states apply evidence-based practices to teaching and that <a href=""https://www.the74million.org/article/from-covid-learning-loss-to-artificial-intelligence-education-rd-cant-wait/"" target=""_blank"">have been praised</a> by the former Tennessee schools chief who Trump nominated as deputy secretary of education.
The cancellation of contracts began at IES, but is expected to extend to other parts of the department. A department spokeswoman, Madi Biedermann, said earlier this week that 89 contracts worth nearly $900 million had been canceled at IES — not counting the new crop canceled on Friday.
Other officials said the total number was 167 or 169. It’s not clear what accounted for the discrepancy. IES has a small full-time staff; most of its work is<b> </b>contracted out.
It’s also not clear<b> </b>whether the savings are as deep as the<b> </b>department said.
Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, pulled data on the canceled contracts that suggested DOGE overstated the cost of some of them. He also found that, in many cases, contractors are already several years into their agreements, so a lot of the money has been spent already. His preliminary calculations show that the actual savings may be half as much as DOGE claims, or less.
Malkus’s concern is that agreements were canceled without careful consideration, and for less of a benefit than advertised.
“There’s a lot of bloat in IES. There’s a lot of problems to be solved,” he said. “These are problems you solve with a scalpel and maybe a hatchet, but not a bulldozer.”
‘Complete confusion’
The “bulldozer” arrived at IES on Monday, when a young representative of DOGE delivered the list of contracts to be terminated to the department’s acting director. Soon after, a flurry of emergency meetings began, first with managers and then with rank-and-file employees, announcing that the contracts were being canceled, effective immediately.
There were no reasons given for the cuts, attendees said, except that DOGE wanted them. The mood was somber, with some holding back tears, staffers said. Confused IES employees asked repeatedly about the legality of DOGE’s actions, but they didn’t get an answer.
Meantime, on the outside, texts, emails and calls were bouncing among researchers and contractors as word spread of canceled contracts. The feeling was utter shock and “complete confusion,” said Rachel Dinkes, president and CEO of Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education research groups.
Inside and outside the department, those close to IES research said they<b> </b>were unsettled by the youth and inexperience of DOGE representatives recommending the cancellations, as well as what seemed to be a lack of understanding of the complex, interdependent ecosystem of contracts maintained by IES.
For instance, one canceled contract was for work on the Common Core of Data, the primary database of all K-12 schools in the United States. It includes data on enrollment, demographics and other information about students and teachers, and is used by researchers, government agencies and others for a wide range of reasons. It is, said Dinkes, the “backbone” of knowledge about American education and needed for virtually any effort to compare and analyze schools.
Contracts for the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/01/29/nations-report-card-naep-test-scores-fall/"">National Assessment of Educational Progress</a>, or NAEP, exams were not canceled. But Dinkes and others said that NAEP relies on the Common Core of Data when it creates the sample<b> </b>of schools to administer tests. So running the testing program, sometimes called the Nation’s Report Card, will be harder without the Common Core of Data, she said.
In another example, DOGE killed a contract for interpreting data IES collects from colleges and universities tracking enrollment and financial aid. The raw data will still be gathered, but the studies that made sense of it for the public are gone. That will make it harder to understand how students are using financial aid, staffers said, and to identify barriers to higher education.
“Sure, you have the raw data that scientists can fiddle with, but the necessary step of digesting that in ways that answer questions, it’s gone,” a staffer said. “Now you need a PhD to make any sense of it.”
DOGE also canceled contracts IES maintained to publish practice guides for students and schools on topics including how to prepare for college, how to succeed in high school, how to become literate in STEM — and, for educators, how to solve attendance problems. The guides were the most popular product IES publishes, staffers said.

In other cases, contracts were for programs that are designed to test the most effective way to solve a problem within the education system. For instance, one contractor was running a study looking at how best to accelerate math learning, Dinkes said. She said the study involved giving half of a group of students<b> </b>one type of instruction and the other half another. The goal was to see which teaching method produced better math results.
But the experiment was abruptly terminated this week when the contract was canceled, she said, and the students are no longer getting either of the math interventions.
Before the cuts, some employees tried to lay out these complexities for DOGE representatives, a staffer said. Some contracts were expendable, they suggested, but others were not. But the employees were unable to sway DOGE team.
“They’ve effectively dismantled us,” said one staffer.
“We’re completely crippled,” said another.
In addition, many of the canceled contracts were nearing the end of multiyear projects, so terminating them meant time, effort and money already expended may go to waste.
“Canceling them now yields the taxpayers no return on their investment,” said a statement from American Institutes for Research, which had 15 IES contracts worth more than $180 million, according to DOGE’s list, which was obtained by The Washington Post. “This is an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.”
Biedermann, the department spokeswoman, said the contracts were costing more than they were worth. But she said she didn’t know<b> </b>how or why DOGE reached that conclusion. “The significant amount of money as compared to the outcomes generated for students is not commensurate,” she said.
Asked how DOGE workers have the requisite expertise to make these determinations, she said, “The entire goal of DOGE is to cut waste, and they have been trained to identify that.”
Contracts that can be justified or that are congressionally mandated will be rebid, which can be a lengthy process, officials said.
The cancellations hung over the confirmation hearing Thursday for Linda McMahon, Trump’s nominee for Education secretary, with several Democrat senators pressing her on what was going on inside the agency.
Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Massachusetts) said DOGE rightfully stands for the “Department of Gutting Education.”
“We know that’s just a down payment to gut the education of every public school student in America,” he said. “First they announce the cuts. Then they go to find where it is. So it’s all backwards.”
Grants on the chopping block
Staff at the Education Department<b> </b>are now bracing for the next round of cuts, they said, including more grant cancellations.
Most of the money that Education sends to schools is distributed by a formula, but more than $7 billion is given through competitive grant programs, such as one that pays for after school programs and another that supports charter schools.
Last week, staffers were directed to review all grants that have “illegal DEI in them,” another employee said. On Monday, a DOGE account on X <a href=""https://x.com/DOGE/status/1889105335991820585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1889105335991820585%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"">said</a> that it had terminated 29 “DEI training grants” at the Education Department totaling $101 million.
Also on Monday, DOGE was given access to scour a database detailing all the department’s grants, said one person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private proceedings. “Grants will be [canceled] this week or early next,” the person predicted.
Then, on Friday, the department announced it was terminating $33 million in grants for Equity Assistance Centers, a program created to support school desegregation but that the department said supports “divisive training.”
The DOGE team has also gained access to sensitive department data, including the personal information of millions of borrowers who’ve taken out federal student loans. That’s led to a 30-fold increase in complaints<b> </b>to a privacy office at the department, according to a person familiar with the situation.
Duncan, the former education secretary, said DOGE workers have no qualifications and no legal right to access Americans’ personal data. More important, he said, they have the wrong goals.
“All this sound and noise and drama and not one word about helping more kids learn to read,” he said. “Not even a mention.”",True
Iraqi at center of Quran burnings in Sweden shot dead before court verdict,"An Iraqi man who staged Quran burnings in Sweden was shot dead hours before he was set to receive a verdict on Thursday in a trial tied to the desecrations of Islam’s holy book that drew worldwide uproar, authorities said.
Salwan Momika, an asylum seeker in Sweden and anti-Islam campaigner, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/03/sweden-quran-burning-denmark-islam-stunt-global-attention/"" target=""_blank"">sparked waves of outrage</a> throughout parts of the Muslim world in 2023 when he burned a copy of the Quran outside a mosque during the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha. Videos of Quran burnings by a small group of men in Sweden and Denmark that year ignited a global controversy, drawing <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/03/sweden-quran-burning-denmark-islam-stunt-global-attention/"" target=""_blank"">condemnation</a> from several Muslim nations and leading to riots in some places.
On Thursday, the Stockholm District Court <a href=""https://www.domstol.se/stockholms-tingsratt/nyheter/2025/01/domen-om-koranbranningarna-uppskjuten/"" target=_blank>said</a> a verdict in a trial in which Momika was a defendant was postponed because one of the defendants died. A judge confirmed that the man who was shot dead was Momika and said he had no details on how.
Sweden’s public broadcaster reported that he was killed in a shooting in a city near the capital. It said Momika, 38, had come to Sweden in 2018 and was later granted a temporary residence permit. Swedish media reported that Momika’s TikTok account was live-streaming shortly before the shooting.
Stockholm police said a man was found with gunshot wounds Wednesday night. The police said a preliminary murder investigation was opened and five people were detained, without elaborating.
The second defendant in the Quran-burning case posted a message Thursday on X that said: “I’m next.”
The court had been scheduled to hand down a verdict Thursday in a trial over “agitation against an ethnic or national group” tied to several Quran burnings in Stockholm during the summer of 2023. It said a decision in the case would be announced Monday.

At the time, Sweden also raised its terrorism alert level in fear of revenge attacks. Stockholm condemned the 2023 burnings, although Swedish authorities allowed the demonstrations that summer, citing freedom of speech, and filed charges against Momika.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan even tied the Quran burnings to Stockholm’s bid to join NATO, suggesting he would hold up the process if Swedish authorities kept granting permits for the protests.

NFL competition committee begins mulling possible tweaks to kickoff format,"INDIANAPOLIS — The NFL will consider modifying its <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/03/27/nfl-new-kickoff-breakdown/"" target=_blank>year-old kickoff format</a> this offseason by moving the spot of the ball <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/10/01/nfl-kickoff-format-change/"" target=_blank>on a touchback</a> or by moving the spot of the kick itself, the co-chairman of the league’s competition committee said Sunday.
The comments by Rich McKay, also the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons, came after the committee held its first meeting of the week at the NFL scouting combine as part of the league’s offseason rule-change process.
“If something is going to be proposed as far as modifications … which would be the potential of moving the touchback and/or moving the kicker back, I think those will get talked about, you know, within the next 30 days,” McKay said. “But it’ll take a little while before we get everybody’s input.”
The kickoff format must be reapproved this offseason by the NFL’s team owners, who <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/03/26/nfl-kickoff-change/"" target=_blank>ratified it last offseason</a> on a one-year basis. That is expected to happen. The alignment fulfilled its dual mandate by raising the percentage of kickoffs being returned while bringing the injury rate on the play more in line with that of a running or passing play.
But the owners also could have proposed tweaks to consider when they gather late next month at the annual league meeting in Palm Beach, Florida. Those changes would be designed to promote even more returns. The spot of the touchback on a kickoff could be moved from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line to further discourage kicks into the end zone. Or the kick itself could be moved five yards back, making it more challenging for kickers to reach the opposite end zone. It’s also possible both changes could be enacted.
“You’ll have people that’ll say both,” McKay said Sunday. “You’ll have people say one or the other. It’s always easier to start with one or the other than it is both. And you want to have all of the health and safety implications or potential implications from either change. But I think it’ll be one or the other, I would think. You never know. I know there’s people already talking about, ‘Hey, let’s talk about both.’ But I also know there’s this thing called 24 votes.”
Any proposed rule changes must be ratified by at least 24 of the 32 teams.
The competition committee met Sunday with a group of special teams coaches who contributed last offseason to crafting the format, in which the kicker lines up alone on one half of the field while his teammates line up on the opposite side of the field, only a few yards from players on the receiving team. The group is scheduled to meet Monday with NFL health and safety officials.
“The easier of the options to make sure that you’re going to move the number up on return percentage, in my mind, is the touchback,” McKay said. “Our kickers now in the game are really good. So moving the kick back, I don’t know how much you impact that.”
The competition committee also spoke to the special teams coaches Sunday about the onside kick. League leaders have called the onside kick <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/18/nfl-onside-kick/"" target=_blank>a “dead” and “ceremonial” play</a> because of its low success rate. Under the current kickoff format, a team must declare its intention to attempt an onside kick only while trailing in the fourth quarter. At that point, the alignment reverts to the traditional kickoff setup so the team can try an onside kick.
The special teams coaches believe the onside kick success rate could be improved with adjustments to the rules dictating how the teams must align themselves to begin the play, McKay said. But alternatively, McKay said he could foresee renewed consideration being given this offseason to a fourth-and-15 or fourth-and-20 alternative to the onside kick. That measure, which would enable a team to retain possession of the ball by converting such a fourth-down offensive play, has been proposed by individual NFL teams in the past without ever coming particularly close to being approved by the owners.
“I still believe it could” be considered again this offseason, McKay said. “I could see it because [teams have] brought it up before. That said, you have to get 24 votes. So you have to have other alternatives, one of which may be, ‘Okay, should we tweak the way that they line up and see if we can get the percentage to move?’”
The committee spent two hours Sunday on <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/01/22/nfl-officiating-patrick-mahomes-roughing/"" target=""_blank"">potential further expansion</a> of the list of plays that could be subject <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/02/nfl-electronic-first-downs-replay-assist/"" target=""_blank"">to the replay assist system</a>, McKay said, and will spend more time on that topic Monday. It is scheduled to receive a presentation Monday regarding the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/01/nfl-first-down-electronic-measurement-system/"" target=""_blank"">possible use next season</a> of an electronic system <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/02/29/nfl-high-tech-first-downs/"" target=""_blank"">to measure first downs</a>. That system still would require the on-field officials to spot the ball manually following a play before the electronic system would be used to determine whether a first down was achieved.
The push-the-quarterback sneak <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/08/tush-push-eagles-super-bowl/"" target=_blank>popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles</a> was not discussed Sunday by the committee, McKay said, but he added: “I think it will be.”",False

Democratic senators call for investigation of Musk’s access to federal financial systems,"Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and Ron Wyden (Oregon), the top Democrats on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, respectively, are asking the Government Accountability Office to investigate Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s decision to grant Elon Musk and his “Department of Government Efficiency” acolytes <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/01/elon-musk-treasury-payments-system/"" target=_blank>access to sensitive government payment systems</a>.
In a letter to the GAO — the congressional watchdog — Warren and Wyden say reports of Musk’s access to the delicate financial systems “are deeply troubling.” The systems, they note, process trillions of dollars of transactions each year, contain sensitive personal and financial information about millions of Americans, and ensure that Social Security checks, tax refunds and Medicare benefits are paid on time.
“GAO must investigate and determine who was granted access to these systems, why and how this access was granted, and the implications for the nation’s economic and national security,” they wrote. The senators specifically point to Bessent, highlighting reports that he was personally involved in granting Musk and his team access to the systems, and that he was also involved in the pushing out of the Treasury Department’s top career official, David Lebryk, who long oversaw the federal government’s financial infrastructure and operations.
“The access may threaten economic and national security,” the senators wrote.
Warren and Wyden directed the GAO to investigate and determine which specific systems were accessed, whether the individuals who accessed the sensitive information had the appropriate security clearances, and whether guardrails are in place to protect economic and national security and Americans’ privacy.",False

Trump plans to further restrict undocumented immigrants from public benefits,"President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Wednesday evening aimed at restricting undocumented immigrants’ access to financial benefits from federally funded programs, though they already are generally ineligible for most federal public benefits.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=""https://x.com/PressSec/status/1892350830969270572"" target=_blank>confirmed</a> Trump’s plans to sign the executive order on X, reposting a report from Fox News reporter Bill Melugin that said the order “will direct every federal agency &amp; department to identify all federally funded programs currently providing any financial benefits to illegal aliens, and ‘take corrective action.’”
The action, according to Melugin’s reporting, may be designed to target immigrants who are granted humanitarian parole by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Along with lawful permanent residents, refugees, people granted asylum and victims of abuse or trafficking, people with parole have access to additional benefits, but are still excluded in many cases, according to the National Immigration Law Center.
Some of the benefits available to people regardless of immigration status include emergency disaster assistance, school breakfast and lunch programs and certain public health programs, according to the NILC.",True
Trump posts video offering imagined vision of Gaza after his takeover plan,"President Donald Trump posted to his Truth Social account late Tuesday an apparently<a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114068387897265338"" target=_blank> AI-generated video</a> that takes viewers on a dreamlike journey through an alternate-reality version of the Gaza Strip, remade according to his proposal for the United States to “own” the territory.
In the video, children emerge from a tunnel into an enclave of resorts and skyscrapers, including gold-trimmed hotels labeled “Trump Gaza.” The montage — suffused with the hallucinatory incongruities typical of viral, AI-generated clips — shows Trump sunbathing shirtless with his Israeli counterpart, bearded belly dancers on the beach, and Elon Musk eating hummus.
“No more tunnels, no more fear. Trump Gaza is finally here,” a voice sings to an electronic dance beat. “Trump Gaza, shining bright. Golden future, a brand-new life.”
Trump has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/trump-netanyahu-meeting/"" target=_blank>proposed</a> that the United States take over Gaza, permanently removing more than 2 million residents from the Palestinian territory and settling them elsewhere. He has also said he wants to develop the war-torn territory under U.S. control, asserting that Gaza could become the “Riviera of the Middle East.” His plan has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/05/gaza-displacement-trump-palestinians/"" target=_blank>prompted outrage and swift rejection</a> from Palestinians and their Arab allies in the region.
The 33-second video begins by showing AI-generated clips of Palestinians walking through rubble in Gaza and then flashes an all-caps red, white and blue<b> </b>title caption asking, “What’s next?”
It features AI-generated shots of a massive gold statue of Trump towering over a traffic circle, a toddler holding a large gold balloon of Trump’s head and bazaar-like gift shops lined with Trump figurines. <b> </b>In several scenes, dollar bills fall from the sky, including over a suit-clad Musk dancing on the beach.
The White House did not respond to questions about who produced the video and how Trump obtained it to share on his Truth Social account and on Instagram. In a statement, Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, reiterated Trump’s stated goal of wanting to take over the Gaza Strip and resettle Palestinians.
“As President Trump has said, Gaza in its current state is unhabitable for any human being,” Kelly said. “President Trump is a visionary, and his plan to have the United States involved in Gaza’s rebuilding will allow for Palestinians to resettle in new, beautiful communities while improving conditions in the region for generations to come.”
Trump has given mixed answers about whether Palestinians would be permitted to return to Gaza as part of his plan for the United States to take ownership of the territory and rebuild it. He said that Palestinians and “many people” would be able to live in Gaza when he first announced his plan earlier this month. Days later, in an<a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368595455112"" target=_blank> interview</a> with Fox News, he described his vision as “a real estate development for the future” and said he would own it — and that Palestinians would settle in permanent housing elsewhere.
Trump’s proposal has been broadly condemned as tantamount to ethnic cleansing. Leaders from Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have been <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/21/trump-gaza-arab-saudi-arabia/"" target=_blank>scrambling</a> to put together an alternative plan for Gaza.
On Wednesday morning, critics of the president took to social media to slam his posting of the video, with many describing it as callous and disturbing.
“The video advocating for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza published on President Trump’s social media is not only arrogant and disrespectful, but also violates international law and human rights,” said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian opposition politician in the West Bank, in a statement.
Even on his own platform, Truth Social, some viewers found the video strange or distasteful. Among the trending comments was one calling it “in very bad taste and just plain horrible!!” Another said: “This was weird for me and I love you Trump- This should be deleted.” Several top comments said the gold statue in Gaza in particular was “frightening” and “100% wrong.”
Ismail al-Thawabta, head of the Hamas government media office in Gaza, condemned the video “in the harshest terms,” calling it “degrading.” He said Palestinians will not allow any force to “impose a reality” that contradicts their identity — “even if that force is the United States.”
Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement that Trump was “once again proposing ideas and solutions that do not take into account the cultures and interests” of Palestinians. “Our goal is not to improve our prison conditions but to get rid of the prison and the jailer,” Naim said, adding that Palestinians must first be enabled to establish their state before any building occurs.",False

The report also notes that between 2017 and 2020, nearly half of U.S. adults (48.6 percent) had some form of cardiovascular disease. According to the AHA, 59 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 58.9 percent of non-Hispanic Black men had cardiovascular disease.
Advances in clinical diagnosis and treatment have lessened the burden of heart disease over time, but more needs to be done to treat major risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes, said Keith Churchwell, a physician and clinical professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine who serves as volunteer president of the American Heart Association.
“We need to stop these risk factors in their tracks, keep people healthy throughout their lifespan,” he said in a <a href=""https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-disease-remains-leading-cause-of-death-as-key-health-risk-factors-continue-to-rise"" target=""_blank"">press release</a>. “That will only be possible with a strong emphasis on early prevention and equitable health access for all.”

Trump administration seeking access to database of immigrant minors,"The Trump administration is seeking to grant U.S. immigration officers access to a database that contains information on hundreds of thousands of immigrant teens and children who crossed into the United States without their parents, White House border czar Tom Homan told The Washington Post in an interview Friday.

Judge denies temporary ban on DOGE access to private data,"A federal judge on Friday denied a request to temporarily ban employees working with the U.S. DOGE Service from accessing closely guarded systems inside the federal government that contain tax returns, Social Security numbers and reams of private data for millions of Americans.<b> </b>But another federal court’s <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/"" target=_blank>temporary ban remains in place for now</a>.
The lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Virginia by the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center and an anonymous federal worker is one of several seeking to block DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency, from getting ahold of records kept by the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which processes about $6 trillion a year in electronic payments to households, businesses and other recipients — and keeps vast stores of data on “virtually every single person in the country,” according to the plaintiffs.
Attorneys also asked the judge to block DOGE from accessing records maintained by the U.S.<b> </b>Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which detail the Social Security numbers, birth dates, salaries, home addresses and disciplinary histories of all federal workers and personal information for millions of applicants seeking government jobs. DOGE’s flurry of moves in the first month of the new presidential administration have sparked dozens of lawsuits across the country.
In a written opinion Friday, U.S. District Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr. said the nonprofit and the federal worker seeking a preliminary injunction had “not provided concrete evidence that Defendants are actively misusing or even attempting to misuse their sensitive data.”
A federal court in Manhattan already had imposed a temporary ban on DOGE access to Americans’ private data held by the Treasury, and other requests for temporary bans are pending before a federal judge in D.C. Alston was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term.
“Plaintiffs’ fears of future harm are much too speculative and would require the Court to make several leaps in reasoning in order to warrant injunctive relief,” Alston wrote.
John L. Davisson, director of litigation for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said at a hearing Friday that exposing millions of Americans’ private financial data in a “historically large and consequential breach” violated several federal laws and the Fifth Amendment, and could leave the United States more vulnerable to malign actors.
In one of his first executive orders last month, Trump charged DOGE and its de facto leader, billionaire Elon Musk, with modernizing government agencies and reviewing their functions. Justice Department attorneys said in a legal filing that the groups suing over DOGE’s moves were “seeking unprecedented judicial micromanagement of the Executive Branch’s ability to share government data with its own employees.”
Jonathan Lucier, an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, said at a court hearing Friday that the employees in question were all hired by Treasury and OPM or detailed to those agencies. Granting data access to in-house employees carrying out a presidential initiative “cannot be illegal,” Lucier argued.
Tom Krause, a tech company chief executive who briefly worked for DOGE, is now a senior Treasury adviser and the only liaison to the group. Justice Department attorneys said in court papers that he has never been given “direct access” to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service payment system, only “over-the-shoulder” access “to review activity others performed in the system or data others accessed from the system.”
But Justice Department attorneys acknowledged in a footnote that another employee who began working at DOGE and was then hired by Treasury, Marko Elez, did have access to the closely guarded payment system — which includes details of highly classified programs — until he resigned Feb. 6. He was found to have made racist statements on social media. Musk said he would rehire Elez, who now works at the Social Security Administration, <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/doge-staffer-behind-racist-posts-reappears-at-social-security?embedded-checkout=true"" target=_blank>according to Bloomberg News</a>.
In response to a lawsuit filed by 19 states, another federal court barred Krause from accessing Americans’ personal or financial information pending further legal proceedings. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in Manhattan found that the states would face irreparable harm without the temporary ban “because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.”
Another federal judge in Manhattan <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/"" target=_blank>issued a preliminary injunction</a> in that case Friday, prohibiting DOGE from accessing the Treasury data while the states’ lawsuit is pending. U.S. District Judge Jeannette A. Vargas said she could lift the ban if the Trump administration can show it is taking steps to safeguard the public’s most sensitive data.",True

"Judge adds one-week pause on Trump plan to put 2,100 USAID workers on leave","A federal judge on Thursday extended for seven days <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/07/federal-judge-blocks-trump-administration-putting-thousands-usaid-workers-leave/"" target=""_blank"">his temporary restraining order</a> on the Trump administration’s move to place about 2,100 employees from the U.S. Agency for International Development on paid leave, delaying any action while the judge weighs whether to order a longer pause.
Two labor unions representing USAID employees sued the Trump administration last week, saying the sudden halt to funding not only upended overseas aid programs but endangered some employees’ lives in various countries. U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, a Trump appointee, first entered a restraining order last week stopping the plan.
On Thursday, he told Justice Department employees to submit to him by Friday the steps it was taking to ensure overseas employees’ safety and to indicate whether it would cover employees’ other benefits, such as school or car payments, while they are on leave.
Nichols had set his original restraining order to expire at 11:59 p.m. Friday. He extended all the deadlines in the order by one week, while he drafts an opinion on whether to enjoin the spending shutdowns throughout the litigation. He amended the order to ban involuntary evacuations of USAID workers overseas, but not voluntary ones.
Lawyers on both sides were not fully clear last week how many USAID workers were affected. The government said in an affidavit that 2,140 employees had been placed on paid leave as of Feb. 7, replacing the 2,700 figure used in last week’s hearing. The government said 98 percent of those placed on leave were stationed in the United States. The unions said Thursday USAID employs about 4,700 people, and about 1,400 live abroad.
The Trump administration has argued that it was merely pausing USAID spending while it examines whether the agency is pursuing Trump’s agenda, and that some top aides were ousted for refusing directions to immediately stop funding. The employees’ union said the pause has already damaged aid programs around the world and possibly placed employees in danger by not paying for their cellphones, internet or other security measures.
The suit marks the first major legal challenge to the push by President Donald Trump and his allies, led by billionaire Elon Musk and his U.S. DOGE Service, or Department of Government Efficiency, targeting foreign aid programs and USAID staff as part of their campaign<b> </b>to reshape the federal government. The lawsuit is one of several <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/06/trump-resistance-courts-democrats-musk/"" target=_blank>legal challenges mounted by Trump opponents</a> seeking to<b> </b>slow or halt the administration’s barrage of actions to curtail spending, pare back the administrative state, eradicate diversity initiatives and more.
The judge’s extension comes as the Trump administration grows increasingly defensive of the chaos caused by the halt in aid projects around the world.
On Thursday, the Trump administration sent an internal memo to USAID employees threatening to fire them if they communicated with the press about continued disruptions to foreign aid despite Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s issuing an exemption for “lifesaving humanitarian assistance” last month.
“﻿The purpose of this memo is to correct a false narrative in the press, and provide clarity for staff on external communications,” wrote USAID official Mark Lloyd to staff in a memo obtained by The Washington Post.
Rubio’s exemption “has continued uninterrupted and was never paused,” Lloyd added. “Unauthorized engagement externally with the press or others is subject to discipline, including dismissal.”
Leading aid groups say even when they’ve obtained exemptions, they cannot continue their work because Rubio’s “stop work” order has effectively shut down payment systems required to draw down funds. That has resulted in thousands of aid workers and USAID contractors being furloughed, disrupting projects from Asia to Africa to Latin America.
USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.
In another move this week, the White House fired the inspector general for USAID on Tuesday after he released a blistering report saying $489 million in food assistance was at risk of spoilage or potential diversion because of the funding freeze and work stoppage.
The Trump administration is “engaged in a wholesale and rapid campaign to dissolve the USAID in its entirety,” said attorney Karla Gilbride, representing both the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees. “That campaign has begun with the freezing of all funding on USAID projects.”
Nichols immediately interjected, saying, “As I understand it, all funding on all projects is not frozen.”
Gilbride said the government’s claims do “not match the reality on the ground,” in which bills are not being paid and employees are operating in an information vacuum as USAID leadership in Washington is upended. “It is not consistent with the declaration that this is just a ‘pencils down’ pause. Which is what a 90-day review suggested.”
The unions have argued that USAID is a body created by Congress, and a law passed last year requires the president to notify and consult Congress if it intends to “reorganize or redesign, eliminate, consolidate or downsize any agency,” Gilbride said.
“It’s necessary that the court impose the injunction and extend the temporary order so that the situation doesn’t get worse,” Gilbride said.
With a preliminary injunction, Nichols would not be making a final judgment on whether the USAID moves are legal. For now, he must decide whether irreparable harm will be caused if he doesn’t issue the injunction while also considering the likelihood of whether the employees will prevail on the larger question.
Nichols seemed particularly concerned by a “clearly harrowing situation” in Democratic Republic of Congo, where USAID staff in Kinshasa had to evacuate due to civil unrest there but couldn’t obtain any funds from Washington to do so, and wound up crossing the Congo River in small boats, leaving their homes and belongings behind.
Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton said the Trump administration was “committed to every USAID employee’s security, and everyone will be kept safe.”
Hamilton said the Justice Department believes Trump acted within his authority under Article II of the Constitution, and “Eight foreign aid statutes recognize the need for presidential direction in this space. We think it’s consistent with all of those authorities, that the president when he comes into office, on the first day to take brief stock to see that foreign aid is only let out consistent with his policy.”
Hamilton added: “We don’t think a reorganization has happened. It’s a 90-day pause.” But he noted Rubio did send a letter to Congress on Feb. 3 notifying them of the move.
“That notice checks the box,” Hamilton said of the requirement for the president to consult with Congress before remaking an agency. “We think the specifics of that consultation would be a political question.”
Nichols raised the issue of whether the employees’ complaints of mistreatment should be heard by a civil service board, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board, rather than a court. Harrison agreed. “The only thing that’s changing is whether they’re doing work and having access to systems,” Harrison said. “This makes this very much a personnel dispute, not appropriate for federal district court.”
Gilbride responded that going through civil service appeals can “take years to reach a conclusion. By the time the MSPB process goes through, many years may have passed and there will no longer be a USAID for individuals to return to. … The unions that are in this case are not seeking damages or back pay on behalf of their members. What they’re seeking is that USAID not be unconstitutionally dissolved.”
The extension comes as former U.S. officials who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations have become increasingly vocal about the ramifications of USAID’s dismantling.
On Wednesday, more than 200 former officials wrote a letter to leaders of the House and Senate saying “the human suffering that these cutoffs have caused is catastrophic and heartbreaking.”
“In Kenya, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere, aid to survivors of torture was stopped in its tracks,” said the officials, who include Michael Hayden, who headed the National Security Agency during the Bush administration; former CIA officer Bruce Riedel; former Middle East adviser Aaron David Miller; former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch; and others.
“Children and adult victims of war and terror who have relied on the United States have been left without care. And in poorer countries around the world, thousands of women and girls will die in the next 90 days due to complications of childbirth that might otherwise have been avoided through interventions funded by Congress and administered by USAID,” they wrote in the letter, obtained by The Post.",True
You can finally press ‘reset’ on your Instagram feed. Here’s why you should.,"Does it ever feel like your social media feed just doesn’t get you? Or that it keeps leading your kids down <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/teens-instagram-feed-mental-health/"" target=_blank>unhealthy rabbit holes</a>?
You don’t have to put up with it anymore.
Instagram has released a <a href=""https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/reset-instagram-content-suggestions"" target=""_blank"">long-promised “reset” button</a> to U.S. users that clears the algorithms it uses to recommend you photos and videos. TikTok offers a reset button, too. And with a little bit more effort, you can also force YouTube to start fresh with how it recommends what videos to play next.

It means you now have the power to say goodbye to endless recycled dance moves, polarizing Trump posts, extreme fitness challenges, dramatic pet voice-overs, fruit-cutting tutorials, face-altering filters or whatever other else has taken over your feed like a zombie.
Right now, many people are <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/23/meta-potus-instagram-facebook-tiktok-users/"" target=""_blank"">fed up</a> with Instagram and its owner Meta — for filling our apps with junk, for ending <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/08/meta-fact-checking-facebook-instagram-users/"" target=""_blank"">fact-checking</a> and for the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/10/meta-dei-affirmative-action-zuckerberg/"" target=""_blank"">behavior</a> of its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Resetting my algorithm made my Instagram less annoying without taking the ultimate step of deleting my account. A fresh start is also what the doctor ordered for me and my family’s mental health.
I know some people love what their apps show them. But the reality is, none of us are really in charge of our social media experience anymore. Instead of just friends, family and the people you choose to follow, nowadays your feed or For You Page is filled with recommended content you never asked for, selected by artificial-intelligence algorithms.
Their goal is to keep you hooked, often by showing you things you find outrageous or titillating — not joyful or calming.
And we know from <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/03/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-revealed/"" target=_blank>Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen</a> and others that outrage algorithms can take a particular toll on young people. That’s one reason they’re offering a reset now: because they’re under pressure to give teens and families more control. (Parents of teens, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/17/teen-accounts-parental-controls-setup-instagram/"" target=_blank>see here</a> for some more things you can do to protect your kids.)
“Sometimes we make mistakes,” said Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCjja6Hzc7g/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" target=_blank>video announcing the reset button</a> last year. “Sometimes you might end up in a pattern where you just make Instagram unintentionally into something you do not really love.” (Nice of him to blame us for that, rather than Instagram’s software.)

So how does the algorithm go awry? It tries to get to know you by tracking every little thing you do. It’s not just likes and shares — they’re even analyzing your “dwell time,” when you unconsciously scroll more slowly over certain posts.
But it doesn’t actually understand your mind. One friend, who’s the mother of a toddler, noticed her Instagram feed was being taken over with smut about parents’ desperate strategies to find private time to do the hokey pokey. Turns out, this is actually a content niche. (How have your feeds gone awry? <a href=""mailto:geoffrey.fowler@washpost.com"" target=_blank>Email me</a> your horror stories.)
For me, an Instagram account I made to share baby photos of my son turned into a fear machine when he was about a month old. It increasingly began showing images of babies with severe and uncommon health conditions, preying on my new-parent vulnerability to the suffering of children.
I called for Instagram to let us press reset when I <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/12/instagram-algorithm/"" target=_blank>wrote about my nightmare feed</a> in 2022. Now we finally can.

What you need to know about how a social media reset works
An algorithm reset isn’t the solution to all of our social media problems, but it’s better than what has come before.
When you do the reset on any of your accounts, the recommended content in places like Instagram’s Feed, Explore tab and Reels or TikTok’s For You Page will no longer be tailored to your past behavior.
You’ll still see content from friends and accounts you’ve previously chosen to follow. If part of your problem is that you don’t like who you’re following, Instagram will also give you the chance to unfollow a bunch as part of the reset process.
Just know that once you press reset, you can’t undo it. “It’s going to make your Instagram much less interesting at first,” warned Instagram’s Mosseri when he announced the reset button.

Counterpoint: You might also see “less interesting” as a good thing. The more likely you are to stop scrolling and put down your phone, the more likely you are to talk to friends, read a book or take a nap. (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7iQbBbMAFE"" target=_blank>Free your mind</a>, and the rest will follow.)
Doing a reset also won’t stop Instagram, TikTok or YouTube from trying to recommend more content you didn’t ask for. They’re just going to start fresh and tailor your algorithm in new ways.
After I pressed reset on Instagram, most of the targeted problematic content I used to see was gone. Instead, my Explore page was filled with generic Instagram trash. But I could see it trying to adapt pretty quickly, for example, offering up more dog content after I watched more dog videos. Instagram says you can send it signals for what kind of algorithm you would like by actively tapping like and watching certain content to the end. (You can also press reset again every time it starts to get annoying.)
For my friend with the racy Instagram feed, she still saw “weirdly sex-oriented” content recommended after pressing reset. It’s possible that’s because Instagram was basing her new algorithm on accounts she has followed that sometimes include that kind of content.
A cynical point of view is that doing a reset allows the tech companies to become even better at preying on us, because they’ll be able to test different algorithms on you.
Also know that a reset won’t actually force Instagram to delete your old data — only deleting your whole account can do that. Nor will pressing the algorithm reset button do away with all of the data they use to target you with ads.

For YouTube, a reset involves deleting the history of videos you’ve watched in the past. That’s one of the major signals that YouTube uses to make future recommendations. You can even turn off your YouTube history going forward, so its algorithms won’t have the data to try to interpret your interests.
If you’re not ready to totally say goodbye to your algorithm, there may be other things you can do to tailor your experience. Many social media apps let you nip and tuck around the edges of your algorithm by tapping buttons to say you like or want to see more or less of certain topics. TikTok has a slider, in settings, to request more or less dance, fashion, nature or pets. On YouTube, if you click “like” on what you do like, its algorithms should listen. (Some people even turn shaping their algorithms into an art — there was <a href=""https://x.com/old_ric/status/1875955842509635944"" target=_blank>one guy</a> who crafted an Instagram that recommends nothing but eggs.)
If, like me, what you really want is social media that features only the stuff you followed, you can kind of hack your way into it. There’s another Instagram setting under “Content preferences” called “snooze suggested posts in feed” that tells the app to stop recommending content there for 30 days. You just have to keep going back to press it again every month. This, sadly, is what counts as putting users “in control” these days.",False
"Argentina to withdraw from World Health Organization, following Trump","Argentina will withdraw from the World Health Organization, a spokesman for President Javier Milei said Wednesday, just weeks after his ally, President Donald Trump, announced he would again pull out of the global health alliance.
Milei instructed his foreign minister to leave the alliance due to “profound differences regarding health management, especially during the pandemic” and “a lack of independence from the political influence of some states,” presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni said in a news conference Wednesday.
“Argentines are not going to allow an international organization to intervene in our sovereignty, much less in our health,” Adorni said.
The move by South America’s second-largest economy follows a Trump<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/"" target=""_blank""> executive order</a> that terminates the United States’ commitment to the organization. Trump has accused the WHO of fueling the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/"" target=""_blank"">coronavirus</a> pandemic that helped end his first presidency and  charged that it helped cover up the origins and spread of the virus.
The United States is responsible for nearly 20 percent of the WHO’s funding. Public health experts warn that Trump’s departure could cripple the organization’s operations at a time when member nations are battling several dangerous outbreaks around the world and trying to stop the return of vaccine-preventable childhood diseases, such as measles. They also fear it could leave an opening for China to assume greater control over the agency that helps coordinate the response to international health crises, The Washington Post has<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/23/trump-world-health-organization/"" target=_blank> reported. </a>
Milei, a libertarian economist whom Trump has called his “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/20/trump-milei-argentina-similarities/"" target=_blank>favorite president</a>,” is one of Trump’s most important allies in Latin America. Milei attended Trump’s inauguration and has often expressed his admiration for the U.S. president. After taking office in late 2023 on a promise to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/10/javier-milei-inauguration-argentina/"" target=_blank>take a chainsaw </a>to government, Milei has slashed regulations, government jobs and several entire agencies.
Argentina does not receive WHO funding for its health management, Adorni said, so the decision will not mean “a loss of funds for the country, nor does it affect the quality of services.” However, Adorni added, it will allow the government greater flexibility to implement policies aligned with the “interests of Argentina.”",False
"At forum, Bowser won’t rule out public funds for NFL stadium at RFK","On Thursday night, before a packed auditorium at Eastern Senior High School, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) made it clear once again: She wants the Washington Commanders to build its next NFL home at the site of RFK Stadium, and she’s not ruling out a public subsidy to help them do it.
Bowser called a football stadium “the fastest and surest route to developing the site,” a 177-acre swath of land on the banks of the Anacostia River that the city recently secured<b> </b>control of after years of negotiations in Congress.
“Until we have a modern stadium, we will not be able to host events like the world is used to, including a World Cup, including a Super Bowl — and yes, Beyoncé<b> </b>and Taylor Swift,” said Bowser.
The mayor’s remarks came at her largest public forum on the RFK development since the city secured control of the federal<b> </b>land’s destiny. The stadium was left to crumble for years because of a restrictive lease that did not allow commercial development — but after a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/12/25/rfk-stadium-bill-dc-bowser/"" target=_blank>Christmas miracle of sorts in Congress</a>, D.C. is permitted to develop<b> </b>the site for multiple uses.
Bowser said she plans to work with the Commanders, who now play in Landover, Maryland, to convince them D.C. is the best location and reach terms that she believes will benefit residents. Her administration will also propose plans for the rest of the site — which could include housing, a large indoor sportsplex run by the city’s parks and recreation department, and other commercial development, Bowser said.<b> </b>Commanders principal owner Josh Harris has avoided expressing an outright preference for the new stadium location, which will likely go in D.C. or Maryland, but he <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/21/commanders-rfk-stadium/"" target=_blank>called RFK the “spiritual home”</a> of the Commanders, took a photo with Bowser at the signing of the RFK bill at the White House, and has said D.C. is the most politically viable site.
But Bowser’s vision is likely to face intense scrutiny from a divided D.C. Council and their constituents, who are not all convinced that an NFL stadium would be a good bet for city taxpayers. And in this case, city lawmakers have leverage: Any plan using public dollars will have to go through them. The question of whether taxpayer money will help fund a football stadium — and if so, how much — is shaping up to be one of<b> </b>this year’s<b> </b>largest political battles in the District.
The line to get into Eastern snaked around the block as residents waited for the chance to hear the mayor make her case — and answer more than an hour’s worth of their questions. People passed out fliers, printed with the words “COMMUNITY FIRST AT RFK” and “NO BILLIONAIRE’S PLAYGROUND.”
“I don’t want to see a stadium,” said Leslie Fields, 64, who has lived in D.C. for four decades. 'We’ve got people sitting in the streets. There’s a lot of things that we need to pay for. We don’t have a billion dollars lying around.”
During her 20-minute presentation, Bowser argued that an NFL stadium — particularly one surrounded by housing, retail and other recreation opportunities — would<b> </b>bring jobs and tax revenue<b> </b>to the city. To support her argument, she cited a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/13/dc-sports-study-rfk-stadium-commanders/"" target=_blank>sports study she commissioned and released last year</a> that estimated more than $1 billion in annual economic output could come from a mixed-use development with an NFL stadium. She assured residents that she envisioned much more than football at the site. With a parcel of this size, she said,<b> </b>“we can indeed do it all.”
Some<b> </b>residents were all for it.
“Let’s just build a stadium — Super Bowl status!” one said.
Many had more tempered enthusiasm or outright skepticism. Neighboring<b> </b>Kingman Park residents wanted assurances they would not be displaced from their homes; Bowser promised they would not. Others wanted guaranteed opportunities for small local business owners at the site, assurances that care would be taken to avoid negative environmental impacts and promises that city leaders would be thoughtful about traffic. Skateboarders asked to be considered, hoping they wouldn’t be displaced from one of the few good places to skate in the city. A team of young pole-vaulting champions who practice nearby asked for the same.
Several focused on parking. How much space would NFL stadium parking requirements actually eat up? While Bowser estimated a stadium would take up 20 to 25 acres, she would not provide an estimate for parking space.
Others focused on public funding. Why fund a stadium, they asked, when the city still struggles in some cases to deliver basic resident services?
Asked by one man whether she would commit to not offering the NFL team a subsidy, Bowser’s answer was unequivocal: “No.”
Bowser’s presentation did not offer details about how much public money she would be willing to offer the team, only saying that her administration’s “detailed analysis” found that a stadium would be a good investment. But some<b> </b>wanted more details about the mayor’s economic argument, feeling uncertain that taxpayers would benefit.
Some economists argue there is consensus that sports stadiums do not pay off for cities: One <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/13/dc-sports-study-rfk-stadium-commanders/"" target=_blank>told The Washington Post last year</a> that he did not even want to go into the specifics of Bowser’s sports study “because I fear going into the details grants some legitimacy to the idea that there is some debate over the economic impact of stadiums.”
Last year, a<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/05/22/commanders-stadium-rfk-site-poll/"" target=_blank> Washington Post-Schar School poll</a> found that 47 percent of D.C. residents were in favor of city funds being used for an NFL stadium and 46 percent were opposed.
D.C. Council members<b> </b>are divided, too.
Ward 2 council member Brooke Pinto (D) is shaping up to be a Bowser ally on this issue: She said last week that it was time to bring the Commanders to D.C., and that she was open to all funding options to do so — including public funding.
But at least five of the council’s 12 current lawmakers — Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Janeese Lewis George (D-Ward 4), Zachary Parker (D-Ward 5), Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) and Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) — say they would oppose taxpayers footing the bill for a stadium. Nadeau opposes a stadium entirely, a spokesperson confirmed last week. And Allen is heavily skeptical, arguing that an NFL stadium and parking would mean sacrificing additional housing and commercial space with higher potential for full-time, year-round jobs. “I don’t think we’re having an honest conversation about what the trade-offs are,” he said in an interview last week.
Five council members — Kenyan R. McDuffie (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Christina Henderson (I-At Large), Matt Frumin (D-Ward 3) and Wendell Felder (D-Ward 7) — either declined to commit to a position on public financing or did not respond.
Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) said in a statement Friday that he did not think D.C. taxpayers should foot the bill but that it would be “premature” to comment on financing for a stadium until he has seen the mayor’s full proposal.
Felder, whose ward includes the RFK area, sat onstage next to Bowser at Thursday night’s forum. He<b> </b>spoke about a stadium as a possible economic boon for his constituents but later said he needed to see specifics before he’d decide whether taxpayer money should help fund one.
“I don’t deal in hypotheticals; I need to see a proposal,” he<b> </b>said as he left.
Penn Branch resident<b> </b>Jimmie Williams said he was generally supportive of an NFL stadium coming to D.C. — noting that D.C.'s loss would be another jurisdiction’s gain. But he wanted to make sure any stadium deal was done with care and an eye toward residents’ concerns.
“This is an economic benefit for D.C.,” said Williams. “But it’s got to be done right.”

Johnson: House GOP to meet tonight after ‘productive’ meeting with Trump on budget,"House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said House Republicans’ five-hour meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump was “very productive,” predicting that lawmakers will soon be able to announce how they plan to advance the president’s agenda.
“The president started off the meeting and sort of set the table for the discussion,” Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill. “We’ve got out the whiteboards, and we worked out the framework for what we believe will be the path forward, and we’re going to meet again tonight to finish up some final details.”
House Republicans have been working to find agreement within their ideologically divisive majority on a budget resolution that would set the fiscal parameters necessary to package Trump’s legislative agenda in one bill.
Republican senators have said they intend to move forward on approving components of Trump’s agenda in two bills next week. Johnson urged GOP senators to “allow the House to do its work,” as House Republicans fret that if they do not reach an agreement, the Senate will jam them with its fiscal and policy preferences.
“We are moving this as quickly and as expeditiously as possible,” he continued. “ … We’re really grateful to the president for leaning in and doing what he does best, and that is put a steady hand at the wheel and get everybody working.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday afternoon that Trump outlined his tax priorities early in the meeting to lawmakers: eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security and overtime pay, as well as renewing individual portions of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which are<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/12/tcja-tax-cuts-expiration/"" target=_blank> set to expire at the end of 2025</a>.

"Trump set to pull funding from schools based on race, gender teaching","The White House is preparing to issue a trio of executive orders on education, including one directing the Education Department to withhold federal funding from any school that teaches about “radical gender ideology” or “critical race theory,” officials said Wednesday.
The order instructs the secretary of education to present a strategy to achieve this within 90 days, according to a summary.
A second order promotes school choice options, including an attempt to help states use federal funding for private-school voucher programs. The third order seeks to combat antisemitism in schools.
For years, Republicans including President Donald Trump have attacked schools for teaching a basket of ideas about systemic racism labeled critical race theory. Trump has also attacked schools for policies and lessons that recognize and respect transgender students.
Federal law allows the agency to withhold federal funds from any school that discriminates based on race. Trump and his allies argue that lessons about systemic racism amount to discrimination, because they presume certain things about people based on race, such as that White Americans enjoy certain privileges based on their race. They say that giving rights to transgender students, especially transgender girls and women, discriminates against cisgender girls and women by forcing them to share spaces and sports teams.
The order also reinstates the<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/02/trump-1776-commission-education/"" target=_blank> 1776 Commission</a>, which Trump created just a week before the 2020 presidential election to promote “patriotic education.” The commission wrote a report that was published in the final days of his first term. The report came under heavy fire from historians as a distortion of American history, and President Joe Biden disbanded the panel as one of his first acts. As a candidate, Trump promised to reinstate the commission if reelected.

Judge says Trump officials have not complied with order to restart foreign aid,"A federal judge in D.C. on Thursday told the Trump administration it had failed to comply with his order to restart billions in foreign aid but stopped short of holding officials in contempt of court as plaintiffs in a pair of lawsuits had asked.
Earlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Amir H. Ali issued a temporary restraining order blocking the administration from putting a 90-day pause on foreign assistance. In Thursday’s ruling, he said the order “was clear,” but Trump officials had not followed it.
President Donald Trump placed the aid on hold as one of his first actions after taking office in January, saying the aid did not align with American interests or values.
Health organizations filed suit in response, claiming the Trump administration was endangering the lives of many around the world who relied on the assistance to combat HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. The money also went to other development projects.
After Ali issued his temporary restraining order, or TRO, requiring Trump officials to restart the aid on Feb. 13, the administration said it had authority under other statutes to continue much of the freeze. Ali rejected that idea Thursday.
“The TRO does not permit Defendants to simply search for and invoke new legal authorities as a post-hoc rationalization for the enjoined agency action,” Ali wrote.",True

"Asked about reported Guantánamo conditions, White House says migrants there are ‘criminals’","When asked Tuesday about inhumane conditions described by migrants held at Guantánamo Bay over the past two weeks, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters not to forget that they were “criminals.”

Hegseth rejects scrutiny of Trump’s Joint Chiefs pick,"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday refused to address whether the Trump administration’s choice to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is “underqualified” for the position, as concerns proliferated in Washington following last week’s firing of the military’s top officer and six other senior Pentagon leaders.
“I’m going to choose to reject your unqualified question,” Hegseth told a reporter at the Pentagon ahead of a meeting with the defense secretary’s counterpart from Saudi Arabia.
The question, posed by a reporter from the Reuters news agency, and Hegseth’s testy response reflected the tension sparked by <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/trump-joint-chiefs-of-staff-charles-brown-dan-caine/"" target=_blank>President Donald Trump’s announcement</a> Friday night that he had removed Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and nominated in Brown’s place a retired officer, Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, who possesses few of the qualifications detailed in U.S. law for the position.
The other senior officers who were abruptly dismissed on Friday include the head of the U.S. Navy, Adm. Lisa Franchetti; the No. 2 officer in the Air Force, Gen. James Slife; Hegseth’s senior military assistant, Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short; and the top military lawyers for the Army, Navy and Air Force. The head of the Coast Guard, Adm. Linda Fagan, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/21/trump-coast-guard-linda-fagan/"" target=_blank>was fired</a> a day after Trump’s inauguration.
Retired military officers and experts on civil-military affairs have raised alarm about the firings, questioning whether Trump wants loyalists in uniform rather than nonpartisan officers. While the president is free to choose the generals he wants, they observed, the chairmanship and many other senior military positions are meant to bridge presidential administrations, providing continuity and expertise.
Democrats in Congress have said the Pentagon purge <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/21/trump-firings-generals-admirals/"" target=_blank>endangers national security</a>.
Caine, a retired F-16 pilot and Special Operations commander in the National Guard, retired from the military in January and had moved on to a career in venture capitalism. Although he had a leadership role in the U.S. campaign against the Islamic State extremist group and later served as the senior military officer at the CIA, he has never been a service chief, Joint Chiefs vice chairman, or four-star general in charge of a combatant command.
U.S. law states that a president may appoint an officer to the chairmanship “only if” they have held one of those jobs, though it notes the commander in chief can waive those requirements if he determines doing so is “necessary in the national interest.”
After Hegseth’s terse response to the Reuters reporter drew attention on social media, he wrote on his official X account that Caine “is the man to meet the moment! Full stop.”
Hegseth, a former Fox News host, and his team at the Pentagon have taken an increasingly aggressive posture to outside scrutiny of their moves, launching a new rapid-response account on X over the weekend that has repeatedly attacked lawmakers and journalists who have questioned their decisions. A separate White House rapid-response account called the Reuters reporter, <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/authors/idrees-ali/"" target=_blank>Idrees Ali</a>, a “<a href=""https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894134198811721922"" target=_blank>Fake News loser</a>.” That post was shared by Hegseth with his personal account and by a political appointee at the Pentagon, the deputy press secretary Kingsley Wilson, on her official government account.
A spokesman for Hegseth, Sean Parnell, said in a post on X that the question about Caine’s qualifications was “inappropriate” and “demeaning to an extraordinary leader.
“Dan Caine is the right man &amp; leader for this moment &amp; any suggestion to the contrary is just unfair,"" Parnell said.
Ali referred questions to a spokesperson for Reuters. In a statement, the news organization said: “The question our reporter asked was timely and newsworthy.”
Administration officials have defended the Pentagon firings by noting that other presidents have removed generals, pointing to the dismissals of Gen. Stanley McChrystal by President Barack Obama in 2010 and Gen. Douglas MacArthur in 1951 by President Harry S. Truman. In those cases, however, the presidents had proximate causes — McChrystal was fired after his staff disparaged Obama in an article published by Rolling Stone magazine, and MacArthur openly questioned Truman’s strategy during the Korean War.
The Trump administration has offered no evidence of wrongdoing by the seven senior military leaders fired Friday, saying instead that the president wants officers more aligned with his vision.
Hegseth, speaking Sunday on Fox News, said that he has “a lot of respect for CQ Brown,” calling the general an “honorable man” who was “not the right man for the moment.” Those remarks were in contrast to others Hegseth has made about Brown, whom he accused of being overly focused on diversity initiatives and had <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/13/trump-charles-q-brown-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary/"" target=_blank>publicly mused about firing</a>.
“Dan ‘Razin’ Caine is going to be a fantastic chairman,” Hegseth said on Fox News. “I look forward to working with him, and he will give straightforward advice, as he did to President Trump on the defeat of [the Islamic State].”
Hegseth also has defended his decision to fire the top military lawyers in the Army, Navy and Air Force, saying in his interview Sunday that the administration wants lawyers who give “sound constitutional advice and don’t exist to attempt to be roadblocks to anything.”
Asked by another reporter on Monday to explain how the fired military lawyers had presented roadblocks, Hegseth said it was “not about roadblocks to an agenda, it’s roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.”
“So ultimately, I want the best possible lawyers in each service to provide the best possible recommendations, no matter what, to lawful orders that are given,” Hegseth said. “We didn’t think those particular positions were well suited, and so we’re looking for the best. We’re opening it up to everybody to be able to be the top lawyer of those services.”",False

Bystander shot during robbery attempt at Waterfront Metro,"A bystander was shot and wounded inside the Waterfront Metro station in Southwest Washington on Tuesday night during a robbery attempt, according to a Metro spokeswoman.
The woman, who was an accidental victim, was taken to a hospital with what appeared to be injuries that were not life-threatening, the spokeswoman said.
The station, at 4th and M streets, is within two or three blocks of some of the city’s premier after-dark attractions, including the Arena Stage and the Wharf dining, residential and retail development.
It is east of the Maine Avenue waterfront, for which it is named.
Just before the shooting, which occurred a few minutes after 9 p.m., five people were involved in an attempted robbery on the mezzanine level of the station, according to the spokeswoman.
During the attempt, shots were fired and a bullet ricocheted and struck the woman.

The mezzanine level is between the street level entrance and the train platform. At the time of the gunfire, a special police officer, who was assigned to the station, was on the platform, the spokeswoman said.
In the District, special police are security guards who are authorized to carry firearms at sites where they are on duty. The officer heard the shots and notified Metro’s transit police department.
The hiring of special police to reinforce Metro’s own police department and bolster safety was reported two years ago.
Four “persons of interest” were stopped in the incident, the transit spokeswoman said. No arrests were reported and the four were not identified.
The station was closed and trains ran through it without stopping, according to the spokeswoman. It was not clear how many people may have seen or heard any part of the incident.
It apparently occurred shortly before theater patrons left the Arena after Tuesday night’s show. The Arena, on Sixth Street, is about two blocks from the scene of the incident.
According to information published online, the show, Sarah Silverman’s musical “The Bedwetter,” was scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. and run until about 9:10 p.m.
Metro described the investigation of the incident Tuesday night as active, and photographs showed the flashing lights of police vehicles clustered in the area.",False
Senators ask nominees about Trump’s potential defiance of court orders,"A Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday for three top Justice Department lawyers was dominated by concerns from lawmakers who asked when, if ever, a president could defy a court order.
Democrats and Republican Sen. John Neely Kennedy (Louisiana) made clear they think the answer should be never.
But Aaron Reitz, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the department’s Office of Legal Policy, was equivocal on the matter.<b> </b>D. John Sauer, the president’s pick to serve as the government’s top advocate at the Supreme Court, was more definitive.
The question was urgent, Democratic lawmakers said, as judges throughout the country have forcefully pushed back on Trump’s efforts to shrink the federal workforce, halt government spending and dismantle federal agencies. Some Trump administration officials, <a href=""https://x.com/JDVance/status/1888607143030391287"">including Vice President JD Vance</a>, have publicly questioned the authority of judges in response to recent rulings against some of the president’s executive orders.
The administration on Wednesday was appealing <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/usaid-aid-supreme-court-payment-deadline/"" target=""_blank"">a looming court deadline</a><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/25/usaid-funding-trump-administration-court/""> </a>to pay hundreds of millions in foreign assistance funds that have remained in limbo despite a judge’s previous order.

“There is no hard and fast rule in all instances in which a litigant must comply with all or some or various parts of a judicial decision,” Reitz, who is currently chief of staff to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), told lawmakers at the hearing. “It is so fact-, law- and case-specific that one cannot speak generally.”
Sauer, who has represented Trump in his previous criminal cases, said, “Generally, if there’s a direct court order that binds a federal or state official, they should follow it.”
As to whether Trump would defy a direct order, he said that having represented Trump for nearly two years, “I just think that’s not a plausible scenario.”
In response to those answers, Kennedy offered a forceful directive to the president’s nominees:
“Don’t ever, ever take the position that you’re not going to follow the order of a federal court — ever. Now, you can disagree with it within the bounds of legal ethics. You can criticize it. You can appeal it or you can resign,” he said. He separately noted his frustration with what he called efforts to undermine the legitimacy of the judiciary during the Biden administration.
The committee also heard Wednesday from Harmeet K. Dhillon, a California lawyer and Republican National Committee member who is nominated to lead the department’s civil rights division. She, too, worked as one of Trump’s private attorneys.
Sauer, who is nominated<b> </b>to serve as<b> </b>solicitor general,<b> </b>has already scored one landmark victory for Trump<b> </b>before the Supreme Court,<b> </b>winning a broad expansion of presidential immunity in Trump’s election interference case.
Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vermont) invoked that court decision Wednesday when he raised concerns about the power of Congress to restrain the president’s authority, citing what he<b> </b>called “a profoundly new set of expectations and boundaries about what the executive power is now.”
If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer would play a critical role shaping the administration’s legal strategy as it responds to a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/trump-lawsuits-executive-orders-actions-legal-challenges/"">flood of litigation</a> over Trump’s aggressive moves.
Sauer, a Rhodes scholar and graduate of Harvard Law School, was a law clerk to conservative justice Antonin Scalia and another leading conservative, J. Michael Luttig, a former appeals court judge. He spent<b> </b>five years as a federal prosecutor before becoming the solicitor general of Missouri when the state attorney general’s office was led by Josh Hawley and then Eric Schmitt — both of whom are now Republican U.S. senators from the state.
They had high praise for Sauer when they introduced him to the committee Wednesday. After he left the state attorney general’s office, he opened<b> </b>a small law practice instead of joining a big firm.
“I don’t think John wanted to be in a position where he couldn’t do work that interested him because it conflicted with the business of the firm,” said John Demers, who worked alongside Sauer as a co-clerk to Scalia and led the Justice Department’s national security division in the first Trump administration. “He took cases he believed in, and he wanted to have the freedom to do them.”
In addition to defending Trump personally, Sauer joined unsuccessful <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O155/163215/20201209144840609_2020-12-09%20-%20Texas%20v.%20Pennsylvania%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20Missouri%20et%20al.%20-%20Final%20with%20Tables.pdf"">efforts to try to overturn</a> the 2020 presidential election results and has a long track record of advocating for conservative causes. He has defended <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-449/328563/20241017143623902_Petersen%20v.%20Doe%20-%20Petition.pdf"">restrictions on transgender athletes</a> in Arizona and efforts to limit access to abortion in Missouri. Sauer also<b> </b>helped lead litigation accusing the <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-411/280017/20230920145521680_2023-09-20%20-%20Murthy%20v.%20Missouri%20-%20Opposition%20to%20Stay%20Application%20-%20FINAL.pdf"">Biden administration of collaborating with social media platforms</a> to censor conservative voices online.
Last year, Sauer donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Missouri Right to Life’s political action committee as it opposed a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/29/abortion-missouri-ballot-amendment-election/"">ballot measure to protect abortion rights</a> in the state, according to Missouri campaign finance records reviewed by The Washington Post.
In court, he often tangled with attorney Chuck Hatfield, who represented Planned Parenthood in Missouri in its efforts to retain funding and renew a license to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/02/missouri-restricts-abortion-planned-parenthood-opens-massive-new-clinic-across-border/"">operate a surgical abortion center</a>. Hatfield called Sauer fast-talking, hardworking and incredibly bright. He also said Sauer is<b> </b>“not the kind of lawyer who is going to try to dissuade his client from a position that he thinks might be a stretch or inconsistent with current law.”
“John is not likely to be a roadblock to policy positions his clients want to take,” said Hatfield, who earlier spent a decade working in the state attorney general’s office. “He’s more likely to be an advocate in favor of those positions — and a very good, a very smart one.”
In Scalia’s chambers, Sauer stood out for his wide-ranging knowledge, outstanding memory,<b> </b>and ability to talk about everything from pop culture to theology and philosophy.
“He’s never offensive, but he loves to argue,” Demers said of Sauer’s style. “He argues on the substance; it’s not an argument about who can raise their voice louder.”
In the days before<b> </b>Trump’s return to the White House, Sauer continued to represent him at the Supreme Court. He tried unsuccessfully to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/09/trump-sentencing-supreme-court-new/"">delay Trump’s sentencing</a> in New York for his hush money conviction<b> </b>and <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-656/336151/20241227163400981_2024-12-27%20-%20TikTok%20v.%20Garland%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20President%20Donald%20J.%20Trump.pdf"">filed an unusual brief</a> seeking an opportunity for Trump<b> </b>to negotiate a deal to prevent TikTok, the video-sharing app, from going dark.
“President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government,” Sauer wrote. The brief was<b> </b>criticized by the Wall Street Journal editorial page and others for not staking out a legal position and suggesting that there could be more than one president at a time.
Sauer’s most high-profile role came last year, when he asked the Supreme Court to rule that Trump — accused in D.C. federal court of trying to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory — should be broadly protected from prosecution for his official actions while in the White House.
In response to a hypothetical question from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Sauer suggested that it could be an official action, and therefore immune, if a president <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2023/23-939_3fb4.pdf"">ordered the military to assassinate a political rival</a>.
The high court’s conservative supermajority ruled in favor of Trump, saying that a president’s official actions could not be prosecuted, though his<b> </b>private conduct<b> </b>could be.
Luttig, who has become an outspoken Trump critic, said his former law clerk is intellectually honest and has great integrity. While Luttig disagreed with the court’s<b> </b>immunity ruling, he said Sauer made the only possible argument that could save Trump from criminal prosecution.
“A man who can convince the Supreme Court that the Constitution affords the President of the United States absolute immunity can convince the Supreme Court the Constitution means anything he wants,” Luttig said. “That the Supreme Court bought the fallacious argument hook, line and sinker was not to Mr. Sauer’s discredit. It was to the Supreme Court’s discredit.”
All three nominees seemed to have the support they would need from Republicans to advance to the full Senate.
As head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, Dhillon would oversee an office whose work<b> </b>traditionally has included<b> </b>investigating police misconduct, enforcing voting rights and filing<b> </b>cases over<b> </b>alleged civil rights<b> </b>violations.
If confirmed, she would be the first Sikh American to hold the position.
Dhillon<b> </b>has previously garnered attention for her legal work targeting social media companies, challenging corporate diversity policies, and suing over California’s pandemic restrictions.
Reitz, a Marine Corps veteran who previously worked for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), would oversee a Justice Department office tasked with advising the attorney general on policy and assisting in the selection of nominees for the federal bench.
Democrats repeatedly confronted him Wednesday with his past posts on the social media site X, many of which have been deleted. One post from March 2020 responded to a ruling from U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel temporarily blocking Texas from closing an abortion clinic during the covid pandemic.
“Judge Yeakal has made his decision. Now let him enforce it,” Reitz wrote, echoing an apocryphal quote attributed to Andrew Jackson in response to a much earlier court ruling.
He was asked at multiple points during Wednesday’s hearing to commit to the concept that even the president should be bound by adverse court rulings. Reitz repeatedly resisted giving a firm answer.
“My position reflects a fairly mainstream view within right-of-center jurisprudential circles, which is simply to suggest that various Supreme Court or Court of Appeals decisions are more limited in scope than maybe our friends who share a different jurisprudential view of Supreme Court holdings would suggest,” he said.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) pushed back. “You’re not giving me great confidence by not stating unequivocally that we are a<b> </b>nation that respects the separation of powers, the role of the courts and … the traditions of the country,” he said.

DOGE staffer Marko Elez resigns after report on racist social media posts,"A 25-year-old staffer who was granted access to the Treasury Department’s sensitive payments system has resigned after the Wall Street Journal surfaced his racist and pro-eugenics posts, a person familiar with the matter said.
Marko Elez, who was working at Treasury but was affiliated with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service, resigned after the Journal unearthed his posts. “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” his account posted, <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93"" target=_blank>the Journal reported</a>.

Arab leaders scramble for alternative to Trump’s Gaza proposal,"President Donald Trump’s plan to remove Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and create a real estate “riviera” on the eastern Mediterranean has spurred a regional scramble for an alternative, with Arab leaders working on a proposal that aims to pump billions of dollars in reconstruction money into the enclave, according to people familiar with the planning.
Leaders from Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar met in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Friday to thrash out details less than three weeks after Trump laid out a plan <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/trump-netanyahu-meeting/"" target=_blank>for the United States to “take over” Gaza</a> and displace the population there, a proposal that has been broadly condemned as tantamount to ethnic cleansing.
The emerging Arab plan would call for Palestinian technocrats to govern Gaza and the provision of substantial funds to rebuild the shattered enclave, where the vast majority of the population of 2 million has been left homeless, according to five people with knowledge of the discussions.
And while details of the plan are still being hashed out, they say there is resounding unanimity on one issue: Palestinians should not be displaced.
“The Trump proposal is so outlandish and offensive to many in the Middle East that certainly it’s a nonstarter. It’s a hot mess,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), who has discussed plans with regional leaders including Jordan’s King Abdullah II, whom Blumenthal met in the Jordanian Red Sea resort of Aqaba this week.
“The Arab plan will seek to present a realistic proposal for reconstruction in Gaza without forced evacuation and without a United States takeover,” Blumenthal said in a telephone interview.
The broad strokes of the Arab plan — hoped to be<b> </b>finalized ahead of an emergency summit with representatives of the broader 22-member Arab League on March 4 — are “becoming clearer,” Blumenthal said. But significant hurdles remain, including reaching Arab consensus and<b> </b>obtaining U.S. and Israeli buy-in, he added.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel is “committed” to Trump’s plan and described it as a “bold vision” for Gaza. The proposal has also received rapturous approval from the country’s far-right politicians, who have pushed for Israeli settlements in Gaza and the enclave’s annexation.
But Arab states are hoping to garner backing for their plan with their checkbooks. A new assessment by the United Nations estimates that it could cost $50 billion to rebuild Gaza after the devastation caused by 15 months of war.
The exact figure to be put forward is “still up for review,” but the proposal is likely to include a headline number, said Emirati academic Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a visiting fellow at Harvard University.
“The number is important because they know the president of the United States is transactional, he likes numbers, and they think he might be swayed when he sees these billions of dollars,” including construction opportunities for U.S. companies,<b> </b>he said.
Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said this week that regional construction firms, including those in Egypt, have the capacity to build 300,000 housing units over a three-year period.
Other proposals being considered appear aimed at keeping Trump’s interest in investment at the heart of Gaza’s future. One, from the Al Habtoor Group, an Emirati conglomerate, <a href=""https://www.alhabtoorgroup.com/gaza/Gaza-Reconstruction-Plan.pdf"" target=_blank>outlines a phased approach</a> that would establish security in the territory and transition emergency housing into redevelopment over 18 months.
Arab countries know they hold leverage by being “the ATMs” for reconstruction, said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. However, the “clash of worldviews,” between Israel and Trump on one side and the region on the other, remains a major sticking point, he said.
During his trip to Washington this month, Netanyahu looked on smiling as Trump outlined his plans for a U.S. “takeover” of Gaza. “The big impediment is if the whole exercise will be accepted by Trump, and certainly big questions over whether it will be accepted by the current Israeli government,” Katulis said of the Arab plan.
Phase one of the Arab plan envisages reconstruction in areas that have not been completely obliterated, but Arab leaders are willing to open their wallets only if other political and security elements of a plan are put in place, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who has recently met with ministers from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan to discuss evolving plans. “It’s a delicate balancing act because all these three pieces need to converge,” he said.
The technocratic committee envisioned for Gaza under the Arab plan would not include Hamas, the ruler of Gaza for almost two decades and architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.
“The two main driving principles on the governance side is that Hamas will have no governing role in Gaza, and also that it creates a political unity with the West Bank,” said Van Hollen, adding that Arab states want the Palestinian Authority, the governing entity in the West Bank, to have some degree of sign-off on the structure.
Arab leaders, like previous U.S. administrations, have long advocated a clear path to a two-state solution, which Netanyahu has repeatedly opposed, along with any rule by the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.
“Squaring that circle is a big challenge at this point,” Van Hollen said.
Two officials briefed on the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive proposals that are still in flux, emphasized that the technocratic government is intended to be a “temporary” body to oversee rebuilding and would remain in place only until elections could be held.
While many officials in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, and in Riyadh remain frustrated that they were not informed before Trump floated the Gaza displacement plan, they also acknowledge that the U.S. leader’s approach has succeeded in motivating the Arab states to act, according to the officials.
“Trump scrambled the table, and it forced other people to start doing some of the heavy lifting,” said one individual familiar with the thinking of the regional leadership. Others in the region draw parallels to Trump’s comments on Ukraine that spurred emergency meetings of leaders in Europe.
But Van Hollen said he also fears that Trump’s plan has set back the chances of making a deal. “In addition to being outrageous on its face, it’s further emboldened the far right and made it more difficult to achieve an overall settlement,” he said.
Hamas’s objections are another potential spoiler to any plan, as is the thorny question of who will provide security in Gaza. Hamas still holds weapons stockpiles, while the security vacuum has led to a rise in criminal gangs.
“There is still a very challenging and complicated road ahead, even if Arab leaders present a realistic plan,” said Blumenthal, adding that Abdullah has been “very clear-eyed and realistic” in his thinking.
But while the gaps remain wide, both Trump and Netanyahu want a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and also to maintain a regional coalition against Iran as Israel mulls <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/12/israel-iran-us-intelligence/"" target=_blank>strikes against Tehran’s nuclear program</a>.
“There is a golden opportunity for Israel to integrate with the region and recognize its wildest dreams,” said Katulis.
While Trump’s initial proposal to empty Gaza of its inhabitants sparked anger in Saudi Arabia, the close ties between the two powers were on full display this week.
Trump made an appearance at a Saudi investment summit in Miami after tapping Riyadh to host talks to end the war in Ukraine. The coverage in Saudi media was glowing. Saudi Arabia “has achieved success on all fronts,” proclaimed a column in Asharq al-Awsat by Tariq Alhomayed, the newspaper’s former editor.
Speaking at the summit in Miami on Thursday, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, addressed Gaza and appeared to dial back elements of the president’s plan that had caused alarm, saying some of Trump’s comments had been misconstrued.
The level of destruction is so great, a five-year development plan “is not physically possible,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we are on an eviction plan,” he said. “It means the president wants to shake up everybody’s thinking.”
Witkoff said Arab leaders are now considering new solutions for rebuilding Gaza, ideas that “people would have never considered, and I think that’s a good thing.”

Trump appoints loyalists to Kennedy Center board,"President Donald Trump was officially elected chair of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Wednesday, installing a new board of trustees as he furthers his executive authority to remake one of the nation’s premier cultural institutions.
The Kennedy Center’s new board is composed of Trump loyalists, including White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance, former transportation secretary Elaine Chao and Trump himself, <a href=""https://www.kennedy-center.org/about-us/leadership/trustees/"" target=_blank>according to its website</a>.
“It is a Great Honor to be Chairman of The Kennedy Center, especially with this amazing Board of Trustees.

Trump’s recasting of the Kennedy Center board breaks from tradition. The arts venue has typically been led by a bipartisan board and evenly split between Democratic and Republican appointees to ensure diverse programming.
On Monday on Truth Social, Trump also named former acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell, who is serving as an envoy for special missions, as the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/02/10/trump-kennedy-center-richard-grenell/"" target=_blank>interim executive director</a> of the Kennedy Center.",True

HUD moves to cancel $1.1 billion in already-awarded housing upgrades,"The Department of Housing and Urban Development, acting on a directive from DOGE, is moving to terminate more than $1.1 billion in loans and grants awarded to improve the energy efficiency and weather resilience of multifamily housing, according to a department official with knowledge of the order.
The termination of the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program puts into jeopardy more than 260 projects across the country, several of which have already begun construction. The projects were expected to create “hundreds, if not thousands of jobs” according to the department official. “It’s unfortunate that they are targeting such an effective program just because it has the word ‘green’ in its name,” the official said.
The department communications office did not respond to questions from The Washington Post. The move is likely to spark legal challenges, as the congressionally authorized funds were already awarded by the department, which is now trying to claw them back.
The program, created through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is targeted at upgrading subsidized housing units. It is designed to help building owners and residents lower their utility bills by using less energy, as well as help fund improvements such as fire-resistant roofs and new heating systems that will prolong the life of the units.
“This program helps to rehabilitate affordable apartments, making sure residents have lower utility costs and can survive extreme weather,” said Lowell Ungar, federal policy director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “You disrupt that and it means higher bills for those who can least afford them and greater risk from storms and heat waves.”",True
"FAA targeting Verizon contract in favor of Musk’s Starlink, sources say","The Federal Aviation Administration is close to canceling a $2.4 billion contract to overhaul a communications system that serves as the backbone of the nation’s air traffic control system and awarding the work to Elon Musk’s Starlink, according to two people briefed on the plans.
The move to cancel a major contract in favor of a venture led by Musk — who is leading<b> </b>President Donald Trump’s disruptive<b> </b>overhaul of the federal government through the U.S. DOGE Service — would represent a significant test of protections against conflicts of interest in government projects. It would be an especially extraordinary step for the typically cautious FAA, whose systems are vital to the safety of millions of air travelers every day.
The existing contract was awarded to Verizon in 2023, with the aim of upgrading a platform that different air traffic control facilities and FAA offices use to communicate with one another.
Musk has personally taken aim at Verizon on his social media platform X in recent days, <a href=""https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1894202642639061144"" target=_blank>saying on Monday</a>: “The Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.”
Verizon did not respond to a request for comment. Joseph Russo, a Verizon executive vice president, said at an event hosted by Barclays Bank on Tuesday that Starlink’s efforts at FAA might be complementary to Verizon’s. Verizon was offering the “reliability and performance” that the FAA needed, and its system was expected to be operational soon, Russo said.
The FAA said in a statement Wednesday that “no decisions have been made” about the Verizon project.
A team of employees from SpaceX, Starlink’s parent company, has been working inside the FAA in recent days, charged by the Trump administration with helping modernize the agency’s aging technology. Ted Malaska, one of them, shared a<a href=""https://x.com/TedMalaska/status/1892705202576277926"" target=_blank> picture on X on Thursday</a> saying he was excited to be working with the FAA, and thanking Musk and Trump for their “vision and focus on safety.”
“I challenge anyone to question the honesty and my technical integrity on this matter,” Malaska <a href=""https://x.com/TedMalaska/status/1894787084663300535"" target=_blank>posted Wednesday</a>. “I am working without biases for the safety of people that fly.”
Several of the SpaceX employees now have FAA email addresses, according to two people who have seen the addresses, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. FAA regulates SpaceX and has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/17/faa-spacex-fine-elon-musk-regulation/"" target=_blank>alleged</a> that the company has violated safety rules relating to its rocket launches.
In a statement Monday, the FAA said it was testing Starlink systems at facilities in New Jersey and Alaska, in hopes of providing more reliable connectivity in remote locations. Elements of the FAA’s deliberations were previously reported by the Associated Press and Bloomberg News.
Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369262913112"" target=_blank>on Fox News this week</a> that the government had been too slow to modernize its technology and that the new administration was ready to move quickly.
“We’re going to look at a year, year-and-a-half time frame and do massive upgrades, improve the systems, help air traffic controllers, keep our skies safer,” Duffy said.
But the Starlink plan adds to Musk’s existing conflicts of interest at the FAA relating to SpaceX, according to John P. Pelissero, the director of an ethics center at Santa Clara University.
Pelissero said it appears that “because of Musk’s current position in DOGE and his closeness to Trump he and his company are getting an advantage and getting a contract.”
“Who’s looking out for the public interest here when you get the person who’s cutting budgets and personnel from the FAA, suddenly trying to benefit from still another government contract?” Pelissero said.
The Transportation Department, DOGE and SpaceX did not respond to questions on how the process of changing contractors has been handled and whether potential conflicts of interest have been reviewed. Trump has said Musk will not be permitted to participate in decisions that pose a conflict of interest.
Verizon was tapped in 2023 to build a system called the FAA Enterprise Network Services Program or FENS, replacing a system that dates to 2002. The contract had a 15-year lifespan, and the system is intended to connect some 4,600 sites, according to the FAA.
The agency was scheduled to make a final decision on whether<b> </b>to start paying Verizon for the contract next month, said one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
Instead, Musk’s team determined the job should go to Starlink, the person said. But the process for unwinding a contract and awarding it to another company is lengthy and has not been followed in this case so far, the person said.
Several senior FAA officials have refused to sign paperwork authorizing the switch,<b> </b>according to the person, who has been briefed on the internal deliberations and resulting fallout, so Musk’s team is now seeking help from the acting administrator of the agency, Trump appointee Chris Rocheleau, and Duffy.
Outside reviews of the FAA’s technology have repeatedly concluded in recent years that it is woefully out of date and that the agency is too slow to make upgrades. A 2023 <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/NAS_safety_review_team_report.pdf"" target=_blank>safety review pointed to technological problems</a> as one factor that was creating “risk” in the aviation system, a problem the Verizon contract is supposed to help solve.
Jessica Tillipman, the associate dean for government and procurement law studies at George Washington University School of Law, said terminating a contract can be expensive, time consuming and could lead to litigation.
“When the government terminates a contract it’s not like it shuts off the spigot,” she said. “It’s expensive to wind down a contract. It’s very expensive and it’s complicated.”
She said negotiating a settlement can take a year.
In awarding a new contract, agencies must comply with the Competition and Contracting Act, which requires competition in government procurements. It does have some exceptions. Among those: national security, public interest or urgency, she said.
“But the question is, how is it so urgent when you already had a contractor dealing with it?,” said Tillipman, adding that there are many different guardrails within the federal acquisition system to make sure things are fair, transparent and efficient.
“However, in the last few weeks she said many of these guardrails have been tested, which will likely lead to litigation,” she said.

Trump: Government will sell $5 million ‘gold card’ to wealthy immigrants,"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the United States will soon sell a $5 million “gold card” to give foreign nationals “green card privileges” and a “route to citizenship.”
Trump made the announcement during an executive order signing in the Oval Office, telling reporters, “Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card.”
“They’ll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it’s going to be extremely successful,” Trump said, claiming that the program — which he said will  begin in about two weeks under his executive authority and without the approval of Congress — is “totally legal.”
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters in the Oval Office that the Trump administration will be ending<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/07/23/trump-officials-revamp-rules-foreign-investor-golden-visa-program/"" target=_blank> the controversial EB-5 investor visa</a> — sometimes referred to by critics as the “golden visa.” The citizenship pathway created in 1990 requires significant investments in a new business that would create full-time jobs in the United States.
Lutnick said the $5 million requirement for the “gold card” would be paid “to the U.S. government” and applicants would require “thorough vetting.”
Lutnick suggested the money would be used “to reduce our deficit,” but Trump would not definitively state whether that money would be earmarked specifically for deficit reduction. The president said that if “gold card” holders create jobs within the United States, “they’ll pay full taxes like everybody else.”
Trump also said he anticipated that the card would be used by American companies seeking to bring in talent from abroad.
When asked whether Russian oligarchs would be eligible for a “gold card,” Trump responded, “Yeah, possibly. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people.”",True
Trump says administration looking at sending criminals out of country,"“Numerous countries” have offered to imprison U.S. citizen criminals, President Donald Trump said Tuesday, and “if we have the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat.”

He said his administration was examining the legality of such action.
Trump’s comments, made in response to questions from reporters witnessing his signing of new executive orders at the White House, came after Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said this week that he would imprison U.S. criminals for payment.
“We have hardened criminals, horrible people, you see them pushing people into subways,” Trump said. “We don’t want these people in our country. … These people are never going to be any good.”
If they are sent out of the country, he said, “you would have a lot less crime automatically.”",True
Pentagon says ‘identity months’  like Black History Month are ‘dead’,"Shortly after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation celebrating National Black History Month on Friday, the Pentagon issued guidance declaring that “identity months” were “dead” within the Defense Department.

Pope shows ‘slight improvement’ amid special prayers at St. Peter’s,"VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis remained in critical condition Monday as the Vatican held the first nightly rosary recitation in St. Peter’s Square, underscoring concern over the 88-year-old pontiff’s health.
There was some measure of positivity Monday night. The Vatican said that Francis, who has been suffering from double pneumonia, showed “a slight improvement” over the course of the day and after a restful night. He had no further asthmatic episodes, and some laboratory tests had improved, it said.
As thousands of people converged on St. Peter’s Square, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, called on prayer to support Francis “in this moment of illness and trial and help him to recover his health soon.”
Vatican officials said this was the first time in their recollection that a special saying of the rosary had been held for Francis. Under a steady drizzle, priests, nuns, religious pilgrims and Romans recited the rosary inside the colonnaded square. Cardinals and senior clerics sat at the top of the stairs in front of St. Peter’s Basilica. The altar consisted of a gold-framed depiction of the Virgin Mary cast against the evening darkness under a white canopy.
Attendees were somber as they prayed, some visibly moved.
“The pope is the most important person in the world for us,” said Wiestow Piosecki, 43, an IT specialist from eastern Poland. He brought his wife and three children to Rome for the jubilee and were devastated when the pope fell ill. “His voice is important, especially with the war in Ukraine. I feel afraid now, afraid he may die. I feel my prayer can help.”

Due to the complexity of his clinical picture, the pope’s doctors at Rome’s Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital were still not prepared to offer a prognosis. In the morning, Francis received Holy Communion, and he worked in the afternoon and was eating solid food.<b> </b>In the evening, he called the parish priest in Gaza whom he has spoken with almost daily throughout the war to offer his “paternal closeness.” Francis, the Vatican said, also offered thanks to those who have gathered in recent days to pray for his health.
A mild renal insufficiency disclosed on Sunday, the Vatican said, was not “cause for concern.” The pope’s oxygen therapy continued, although with slightly reduced flows and percentage of oxygen.
Francis’s health crisis stretched into the end of its 10th day, making this the longest of his four hospitalizations as pope. Some senior clerics spoke in stark terms over the weekend about his chances. The hospital chaplain said Monday that it was time “to hope against hope.”
In recent days, Catholic churches around the globe, including in Francis’s native Argentina, have prayed for the first New World pontiff. On Sunday, Cardinal Baldassare Reina, the vicar general of the Diocese of Rome, held a Mass for the pope, while encouraging other pastors in the diocese to do the same.
The saying of the rosary during a papal health crisis is seen as a spiritual gesture to pray for an especially ailing pope. In 2005, Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, then the undersecretary of state for the Vatican, announced the death of John Paul II to the crowds gathered in St. Peter’s Square after they finished saying the rosary for him.
Giovanni Maria Vian, a former editor of the Vatican’s newspaper and a historian of early Christianity, said the St. Peter’s event on Monday night for Francis also reminded him of a saying of the rosary before the passing of Pope John XXIII in 1963.
“I’m sure numberless such rosaries have been said at Gemelli,” he said. “This [event] feels closer to the prayers in St. Peter’s Square when [John Paul II] and [John XXIII] were dying, back in 2005 and 1963. I was there as a boy, and later [as an adult].”
In the upper echelons of the Roman Catholic Church, speculating on the health of a pope has long been delicate terrain. But some senior clerics have offered surprisingly candid assessments. On Saturday, <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/media/nyc-archbishop-timothy-dolan-worries-about-health-pope-francis-says-its-not-looking-good"" target=""_blank"">Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York said, </a>“We’ve got to be kind of realistic. … It’s not looking good.”
Francis’s doctors have sought to convey more optimism, suggesting his life is only at risk if he develops serious complications.
Talk of his condition is partly due to the pope’s own quest for transparency. His doctors say he has insisted on offering only the “truth” to the public, and the extent of the medical disclosures has been unusual for the Vatican, which is traditionally guarded about a sitting pope’s health.
Francis was admitted to the hospital with a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/17/pope-francis-illness-vatican-hospital/"" target=_blank>respiratory tract infection</a> on Feb. 14.
Late Tuesday, the Vatican said CAT scans had revealed the pope to have double pneumonia. Chest X-rays showed he had developed a polymicrobial infection that arose from asthmatic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, a condition in which the airways widen, leading to a buildup of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. It said he was undergoing a “complex” treatment using antibiotic cortisone therapy.
On Saturday, the Vatican acknowledged in a written bulletin that Francis was in “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/22/pope-francis-critical-asthma/"" target=_blank>critical condition</a>.” It added that he had suffered a “prolonged asthmatic crisis” and a low platelet count. He was alert and sitting in an armchair, it said, but suffering more pain than the day before.
In a Sunday evening update, the Vatican said the pope’s condition remained “critical” but that there had been no recurrence of the respiratory crisis. He received treatment to boost his red blood cells. Blood tests showed “mild” renal insufficiency but that it was “under control.” The pope, officials said, continued to receive high-flow oxygen through a nasal tube.
Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi marveled at the level of detail being released about a pope’s health. He told Corriere della Sera last week: “It’s remarkable how his conditions have been clearly explained. There used to be a tendency to conceal things related to the [the pope], like the Soviet bulletins in which the secretary had but a cold until he died. Now we go into detail. The ‘polymicrobial infection.’ The ‘bilateral pneumonia.’”",False
The lives lost in the D.C. plane-helicopter crash,"American Eagle Flight 5342 had 60 passengers and four crew members aboard as the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/31/dc-plane-crash-happened-potomac-river/"">plane collided with an Army helicopter</a> carrying three crew members, a crash with no survivors just outside Reagan National Airport whose horror reverberated across the country.
Among those killed were <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/01/30/figure-skating-wichita-plane-crash/"">competitive figure skaters</a>, many of them children who dreamed of making it to the Olympics and their parents who shuttled them to and from skating events to help make those dreams come true.

There was the renowned former Russian Olympic figure skating duo who coached some of those kids. A flight attendant who embraced his life of travel. The helicopter crew chief who had a smile for everyone, especially his infant son. The group of hunters who returned from a trip.

“This is a terrible tragedy that will unite those in Washington, D.C., and those in Wichita, Kansas, forever,” Wichita Mayor Lily Wu said.
As family members, friends and colleagues grieve, they also shared memories of the lives they now mourn.

Senate panel advances McMahon’s nomination for education secretary,"On a party-line vote, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted Thursday to advance the nomination of Linda McMahon as secretary of education. The tally was 12-11 to send her nomination to the Senate floor, where she is expected to be confirmed.
“We need a strong leader at the department who will get our education system back on track, and Ms. McMahon is the right person for the job,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), chairman of the committee.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) said he cannot support a nominee intent on implementing President Donald Trump’s agenda, which includes trying to close or diminish the Education Department.
“It doesn’t really matter who the secretary will be, because he or she will not have the power,” Sanders said. As for McMahon, he said, “I respect her, I like her, but I will vote no.”
<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/13/linda-mcmahon-education-department-trump-confirmation/"" target=_blank>At her confirmation hearing</a> last week, McMahon acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the Education Department, but said she would look to reduce its power.

Republican satisfaction in democracy increases to 33 percent,"More Republicans are more satisfied with the way democracy is working in the United States than they were a year ago, when dissatisfaction was at an all-time low, according to a poll released Wednesday.
The December Gallup poll found a similar share of Democrats, Republicans and independents said they were satisfied with the way U.S. democracy is working. Thirty-three percent of Republicans said they were satisfied (nearly double the share last year), along with 35 percent of Democrats and 34 percent of independents.
Gallup attributed the increased satisfaction among Republicans to Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election.
However, while Republicans are more upbeat about democracy, the nation’s overall sentiment has declined in recent decades to 34 percent today and remains low compared to the 1980s and 1990s. Satisfaction with U.S. democracy reached a record high of 61 percent in 1984.
Americans’ satisfaction with democracy today matches what it was in January 2021, shortly after Trump contested the results of the 2020 election, which led to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",False
"Trump ramps up ICE arrests, alarming cities and immigrant communities","The deportation blitz President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail kicked off in U.S. cities this week, delighting many of his supporters and jolting communities where immigration officers appeared — or whose arrival was merely rumored, sending a chill nonetheless.
Trump’s executive orders have given immigration officers extraordinary new powers to cast a wider net and fast-track deportations. The president has scrapped restrictions that kept “sensitive” locations like churches and schools off-limits for immigration officers. Social media posts and school mailing lists have lit up with possible officer sightings, including many false alarms.
The number of suspects arrested — several hundred per day nationwide<b> </b>— has been outpaced by the psychological impact of the attention on ICE operations.
In Boston, a Fox News crew broadcast<b> </b>live as officers knocked on doors and pulled suspects from homes. In other cities where ICE netted a smattering of arrests, immigrant advocacy groups and Democratic representatives denounced “raids” that gave an impression of something larger. Chicago officials said ICE officers tried to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/01/24/immigration-ice-agents-visit-chicago-school/"" target=_blank>access an elementary school</a>, but the agency said it wasn’t true.
“It’s going very well. We’re getting the bad, hard criminals out,” Trump said, speaking to reporters during a trip to North Carolina to view the flood recovery from Hurricane Helene.
Without evidence, he said: “These are murderers. These are people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as anybody you’ve seen. We’re taking them out first.”
It is a sharp break from the Biden administration, which protected most undocumented immigrants from being deported and welcomed thousands of temporary new arrivals via a program called parole. This week the top Department of Homeland Security official issued a memo directing agents to consider swiftly deporting people the Biden administration allowed to enter.
The Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants waiting in Mexico to request asylum through the CBP One mobile app. Trump’s efforts are likely to face legal challenges, but lawyers say immigrants are not entitled to public defenders and therefore will have a difficult time defending themselves in a fast-track process, especially if they are detained. Earlier in the week, Trump officials abruptly halted some contracts that provided legal guidance to detainees.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday night that ICE had made 538 arrests that day, and officials said Friday they arrested 593 more. She wrote that four of those arrested in the sweeps were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Others had committed sex crimes against children, Leavitt said.
Leavitt posted photos Friday showing U.S. troops loading shackled detainees onto a military cargo plane for a flight to Guatemala.
“The largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway,” Leavitt wrote on X on Thursday.
“Deportation flights have begun. President Trump is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: if you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences,” Leavitt later added.
The military flew two C-17 cargo planes, each carrying approximately 80 people, to Guatemala after they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, according to a DHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operations. The flights departed from Texas and Arizona, officials said. ICE Air is continuing to operate deportation flights alongside military planes, officials said.
Tom Cartwright, who tracks ICE deportations for the immigrant advocacy group Witness at the Border, called the military operation “theater of the absurd” in a post on X. “The only thing new about this is subjecting people to transport on a cargo plane,” Cartwright wrote. He noted that ICE carried out 508 deportation flights to Guatemala during the 2024 fiscal year on planes that averaged 125 passengers.
Trump’s border czar Tom Homan cited a higher number of ICE arrests<b> </b>than the White House on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73h1iNQ8XRk"" target=_blank>NewsNation</a> on Thursday night, saying officials had apprehended more than 3,000 people with criminal records in the first couple days of the administration. ICE, which detains and deports immigrants, did not respond to requests to clarify the numbers.
Trump and his officials provided few details about those arrests or proof of their criminal records. Trump has long characterized immigrants as criminals, though studies show that native-born Americans commit a higher share of violent felonies.
Immigration officials did not say precisely how many immigrants were deported as part of the nationwide operations that unfolded this week — or how many were criminals — but officials have said their main targets are serious offenders.
Trump also conducted raids at the start of his first term, and had threatened to deport “millions” of people, though he never came close to that number.
Then, as now, officials said criminals were their top priority. Weeks later, however, congressional aides <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/ice-data-shows-half-of-immigrants-arrested-in-raids-had-traffic-convictions-or-no-record/2017/04/28/81ff7284-2c59-11e7-b605-33413c691853_story.html"" target=_blank>discovered </a>that half of those arrested had no criminal convictions or had committed traffic offenses as their most serious crimes, which ICE said were mostly for drunken driving.
The immigration sweeps hit immediately after Trump took office in cities and states across the country, targeting areas where Democrats have defended immigrants and urged Congress to grant them a path to U.S. citizenship. Trump has called for their mass removal, and on <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/20/trump-immigration-executive-orders/"" target=_blank>Inauguration Day </a>he directed the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense to prioritize immigration enforcement.
Homan, a former acting ICE director and Fox News analyst, said in an appearance Thursday on Fox News that agents were arresting people in sanctuary cities, where local officials refuse to allow agents to arrest immigrants in their jails after police have picked them up for alleged crimes.
Many local officials say they cannot keep someone in jail for a civil immigration violation after a judge has ordered the person released on bail in a criminal case. And some have expressed frustration that ICE targets minor offenders, making the broader community afraid to report crimes to police.
Trump officials have called for rescinding federal funding to those cities and have threatened to prosecute any officials who <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/22/justice-immigrantion-memo-sanctuary-cities/"" target=_blank>obstruct </a>immigration officers.
“Sanctuary cities make it less efficient and more dangerous, but it’s not going to stop us,” Homan <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/video/6367588473112"" target=_blank>said</a>. “We’re hitting every sanctuary city right now.”
Acting Homeland Security secretary Benjamine C. Huffman on Jan. 20 rescinded a directive that discouraged ICE from making arrests in sensitive areas such as churches or schools. He also ended the broad use of humanitarian parole, which President Joe Biden used to admit thousands of temporary migrants from Cuba, Haiti and other countries.
On Thursday, Huffman went further, directing immigration officials to consider stripping an undetermined number of migrants of parole and placing them in fast-track removal proceedings. Huffman declared that there was a “mass influx” of migrants at the southern border, despite a sharp reduction in apprehensions in recent months.
Unless they are “clearly” eligible to enter, Huffman said all migrants should be detained until they are deported or granted asylum.
In Newark, Mayor Ras A. Baraka said Thursday that ICE raided a local business, detaining undocumented residents and U.S. citizens “without producing a warrant.”
“One of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned,” the mayor said in a statement. He said federal agents violated the veteran’s rights. “Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,” Baraka added.
ICE declined to provide detailed answers about the allegations, saying the investigation is ongoing.
But spokesman Jeff Carter said in an email that agents “may encounter U.S. citizens while conducting field work and may request identification to establish an individual’s identity,” which is what happened in Newark.
ICE has arrested immigrants, particularly criminals, across every administration, and the Biden administration boasted that it was aggressively pursuing serious offenders. Days before  Biden left office, <a href=""https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ero-newark-arrests-33-criminal-noncitizens-week-long-surge-operation"" target=""_blank"">ICE said it had arrested 33 criminal noncitizens</a> in a week-long operation in December, also in Newark.
As of July 21, ICE said it was tracking nearly 650,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal records who had been released into the United States, though only 425,000 had convictions. The others were pending trial.
Many are serving criminal sentences in state prisons or jails, while others are minor offenders who had been spared removal under the Biden administration. Trump has said any of the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the United States illegally could be deported.
In the D.C. area, the volunteer group Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network launched a hotline Monday for area residents to call if they believe they see ICE officers in public. The group has not confirmed any wide-scale raids or enforcement actions this week, but the phones have kept ringing, said Amy Fischer, one of the group’s organizers.
“What is really clear is that people are just terrified,” Fischer said. “It really seems like any time there is an unmarked cop car or something that looks like a cop car, people call. … It describes the overall moment or atmosphere that we are living in.”
In Montgomery County, Maryland, county officials said ICE agents arrested an immigrant with a felony in Gaithersburg on Thursday. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for information about the arrest, but it sparked fears of broader immigration sweeps at a local shopping center and high school. Similar rumors have swept across the county since Trump took office.
Some residents have confused local law enforcement for ICE agents, said Earl Stoddard, an assistant chief administrative officer in Montgomery County, a sign of locals’ anxieties that their neighborhood could be the agency’s next target.
“It’s been every day this week,” Stoddard said Thursday. “People calling in worrying about ICE. This was the first time it was real.”

3D analysis shows how helicopter pilots could have mixed up jets in DCA crash,"On the night of Jan. 29, an Army Black Hawk helicopter <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/01/30/dc-plane-crash-deaths-survivors-potomac-reagan-airport/"">collided</a> with an American Airlines passenger jet over the Potomac River in Washington, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/interactive/2025/dca-plane-crash-victims-list-profiles/"">killing all 67 people</a> on both aircraft.
Aviation experts have since raised the possibility that, after being <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/01/31/audio-air-traffic-control-dc-plane-crash/"">alerted</a> by air traffic <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/30/dc-plane-crash-helicopter-recovery-no-survivors-potomac-river/"">controllers</a> to the presence of the jet, the helicopter crew might have mistaken that plane for another<b> </b>incoming jet in the distance.
To analyze this theory, The Washington Post made a 3D model, using <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/30/videos-photos-dc-plane-crash-potomac-river/"">flight data</a> and air traffic control transmissions, and conducted interviews with five former Black Hawk pilots to recreate the view the crew likely had from inside the helicopter cockpit.
Our examination shows how the American Airlines jet and the second plane, though separated by miles, would have appeared close to one another near the horizon and the helicopter crew could have confused the two jets when the tower first warned of incoming air traffic. The examination further shows how around a minute later, as viewed from the helicopter cockpit, the lights of the incoming American Airlines jet could have been obscured by the glow of the city skyline, allowing the jet to go undetected.
The causes of the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/31/dc-plane-crash-happened-potomac-river/"">crash</a> remain under investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board has said the helicopter was flying above its mandated 200-foot ceiling and that its crew was likely wearing night vision goggles, which pilots said can complicate the task of tracking other aircraft.
At 8:46 p.m. the Black Hawk was flying south along the Potomac and the American Airlines jet was heading north on approach for landing at <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/30/reagan-airport-airspace-plane-crash-washington-dc/"">Reagan National Airport</a>.


1 minute 58 seconds until impact
Air traffic control alerts the helicopter to the presence of a CRJ, a type of regional jet. The plane is bound for <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/02/04/dca-close-calls-plane-collisions-history/"">a runway</a> that will bring it close to the helicopter corridor along the river. “<i>Traffic just south of the Wilson Bridge is a CRJ at 1,200 feet for Runway 33.”</i>
1 minute 52 seconds until impact
A member of the Black Hawk crew responds by requesting “visual separation” — an acknowledgment that it has the jet in sight and will take steps to avoid it, according to aviation experts.<b> </b>The controller immediately grants the request.

Around seven miles away from the helicopter is <mark class=""hl_yellow"">AA 5342</mark>, the CRJ. This is the plane that will later collide with the helicopter.
A second<b> </b>jet, <u>AA 5307,</u> is about to touch down<b> </b>on Runway 1.
And traveling a little more than three miles<b> </b>directly behind <mark class=""hl_yellow"">AA 5342</mark>, a third jet, <u>AA 3130,</u> is beginning its approach to the same runway.
At this distance, <mark class=""hl_yellow"">AA 5342</mark> and <u>AA 3130</u> appear nearly aligned, the 3D model shows. Some pilots said variations in the brightness of the planes’ lights could have helped the helicopter crew distinguish the aircraft. Other pilots said the two planes may have been hard to tell apart or appeared as one light, especially if the crew was wearing night vision goggles.
The UH-60L Black Hawk does not come with<b> </b>a radar screen that shows other aircraft traffic, an Army official said. It is common for helicopter crews to use iPads with an app that can track flights, though it is unclear if the crew was using one.

At this point, both the helicopter crew and air traffic controllers believe that the two aircraft have been safely directed, the transmissions indicate.
What follows, pilots told The Post, is an opportunity for the <b>helicopter crew</b> to identify <mark class=""hl_yellow"">AA 5342</mark>. The jet becomes visibly distinct as it peels away from the line of other inbound planes, veering east following the standard approach path for Runway 33.
But if the <b>helicopter crew</b> fails to do so before the jet passes over the city, it will soon be increasingly difficult for them to realize their potential error, pilots said.
About a minute before impact, <mark class=""hl_yellow"">AA 5342</mark> continues to curve east and north, away from the Potomac and over D.C.
1 minute until impact
From the helicopter crew’s perspective, <mark class=""hl_yellow"">AA 5342′s</mark> lights are likely blending with those of the city, pilots said. Night vision goggles amplify light, making it harder to tell light sources apart. They also reduce field of vision. Pilots say they mitigate the effect by swiveling their heads.
<u>AA 3130</u>, on the other hand, is flying over the dark river. Pilots told The Post this would have made the<b> </b>plane’s lights far easier for the helicopter crew to see.
25 seconds until impact
Air traffic control receives an automated conflict alert that the helicopter and <mark class=""hl_yellow"">AA 5342</mark> are on a path to intersect. The controller again contacts the helicopter, using its call sign: <i>“PAT-25, do you have the CRJ in sight?”</i>
17 seconds until impact
The controller instructs the helicopter: <i>“PAT-25, pass behind the CRJ.”</i>
At this point, <mark class=""hl_yellow"">AA 5342</mark> is curving northwest toward the airport. The jet’s position and the angle of approach could cause the landing lights to appear less prominent and potentially go unnoticed by the helicopter crew, pilots said.
15 seconds until impact
For the second time, the helicopter crew confirms they see the jet: “<i>PAT-25 has the, uh, aircraft in sight, request visual separation.”</i>
They are probably looking at <u>AA 3130</u>, the pilots<b> </b>said.
Even if the helicopter crew spots <mark class=""hl_yellow"">AA 5342</mark>, they have little time to respond.
The jet is traveling at about 145 miles per hour and descending toward the level of the Black Hawk.
2 seconds until impact
The<i><b> </b></i>helicopter transmits its last location.
<mark class=""hl_yellow"">AA 5342</mark> would be visible around 1,000 feet from the helicopter. According to the NTSB, the jet’s crew have “a verbal reaction,” and the plane increases its pitch. The sound of impact is audible a second later. Gasps can be heard on air traffic audio.
Flight data records a sudden drop in the jet’s altitude.
Army officials and former colleagues described the Black Hawk crew, members of the 12th Aviation Battalion, as experienced aviators: Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Eaves and Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, both pilots, and Staff Sgt. Ryan O’Hara, the crew chief. The flight was part of an annual flying evaluation for Lobach.
Army officials declined to comment on the findings outlined in this report.
Scott Dunham, a former air traffic controller and retired longtime NTSB investigator, said the instructions given to the helicopter crew that night were typical but additional information could have been provided in the second warning to reorient the helicopter. Former pilots who flew this route said that air traffic controllers sometimes instruct helicopter crews to pause at a designated point about a mile north of the airport when airspace is congested.
On Jan. 31, the Federal Aviation Administration indefinitely restricted helicopter traffic along parts of two routes near Reagan National Airport while it reviews the safety of the airspace.
Before the collision, many pilots would have likely described the helicopter <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/30/dc-helicopters-potomac-river-dangers/"">route</a> around <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2025/01/31/dc-plane-crash-passengers-fear-flying/"">Reagan</a> as higher risk but part of a routine flight, in use for decades, said Austin Roth, a former Black Hawk instructor pilot who also served in the 12th Aviation Battalion.
“Everybody’s looking back and thinking maybe this was inevitable,” he said.
About this story
The Post used 3D modeling software to reconstruct the scene in the sky over Washington in the minutes leading up to the fatal collision. The Post imported OpenStreetMap data of roads and building footprints into the scene as well as commercially available models of the Black Hawk helicopter, the Bombardier CRJ-700 and additional aircraft. We plotted and animated the flight paths of all aircraft using data from ADS-B Exchange, and timed these alongside key moments from Air Traffic Control radio communications. The Black Hawk’s Model S signal was picked up through multilateration, which can be imprecise because it requires multiple receivers to have line of sight. Two former helicopter pilots said data that appeared to show the helicopter turn sharply, west of Hains Point, was most likely an anomaly as the speed at that time would make such a turn unlikely, so The Post excluded this data point from the reconstruction. Altitude data for the helicopter was available only in 100 feet increments. By mounting a camera inside a model of the helicopter, we were able to show the pilot’s perspective throughout the flight and display where key aircraft would have likely appeared in their field of vision. The lighting within the 3D model is a representation rather than an accurate depiction of the thousands of lights across the city, which would be too complex to precisely render at this scale. Pilots consulted for this story include Ken Biddulph, Phillip Brashear and Bradley Bowman who all flew this route many times.

"In new order, Trump administration places more USAID staff on leave","The Trump administration put scores of additional employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave Tuesday, dealing a further blow to the beleaguered aid agency.
In a new letter, Pete Marocco, who was appointed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a senior agency official, told affected USAID personnel they were being put on a paid “excused absence” effective immediately.
“During the period that you are on administrative leave you are not to enter USAID premises, access USAID systems, or attempt to use your position or authority with USAID in any way without my prior permission or prior permission of a supervisor in your chain of command,” Marocco said in the letter, copies of which were obtained by The Washington Post.
It was not immediately clear how many employees were affected. One USAID official said the number could be as high as 1,400.
The move is the latest action since Trump’s return to the White House impacting USAID employees, many of whom have been furloughed or forced out of their jobs, and America’s overseas assistance programs, many of which were suspended while the new administration conducts a review of USAID’s activities.
The campaign to overhaul — and potentially abolish — USAID has been led by billionaire Elon Musk, who is advising Trump in his effort to shrink the federal government. Musk has tweeted that USAID “must die.”
Placing officials on administrative leave has hamstrung large parts of USAID just as humanitarian groups around the world seek exemptions to Trump’s 90-day aid freeze. Officials who received the letter were immediately locked out of emails and unable to manage the flood of exemption requests, a bottleneck that aid workers say has prevented life-saving aid projects from restarting across the developing world.
USAID did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Democrats have vowed to fight any attempt to dismantle the agency, citing its creation in statute. A Democratic Senate aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Tuesday’s move to put additional staff on leave was “sweeping in nature.”",True
Dept. of Homeland Security wants IRS to help with immigration enforcement,"Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem has requested that the Treasury Department provide IRS personnel to assist with immigration enforcement, the Trump administration’s latest effort to expand federal resources to fulfill his campaign pledge to deport more undocumented immigrants.
In a Friday memo to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Noem cited several areas in which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs additional help.

Trump administration orders Pentagon to plan for sweeping budget cuts,"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered senior leaders at the Pentagon and throughout the U.S. military to develop plans for cutting eight percent from the defense budget in each of the next five years, according to a memo obtained by The Washington Post and officials familiar with the matter — a striking proposal certain to face internal resistance and strident bipartisan opposition in Congress.
Hegseth ordered the proposed cuts to be drawn up by Feb. 24, according to the memo, which includes a list of 17 categories that the Trump administration wants exempted. Among them: operations at the southern U.S. border, modernization of nuclear weapons and missile defense, and acquisition of one-way attack drones and other munitions.

Trump threatens to cut U.S. aid to South Africa over land law,"NAIROBI — President <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/"" target=_blank>Donald Trump</a> has threatened to cut all U.S. aid to South Africa while claiming, without evidence, that the government there is confiscating land, wading into a sensitive racial issue while deepening already sharp divisions between the United States and South Africa over the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.
In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump wrote that South Africa “is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,” in comments widely interpreted as referring to White South Africans. “I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!”

"Trump announces 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, including for Canada and Mexico","President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday imposing 25 percent tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the latest salvo in his ongoing effort to overhaul the U.S. trading relationship with the rest of the world.
“This is a big deal — making America rich again,” Trump said as he signed the orders.
The tariffs are likely to renew tensions between the United States and its North American neighbors, which are among the largest suppliers of steel imports. The president last week paused plans to impose a separate set of import taxes on goods from Canada and Mexico, which he linked to concerns over immigration and drug trafficking.
Canada, the No. 1 foreign supplier, last year shipped 6.6 million tons of steel to American buyers, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam rounded out the top five import sources.

"Trump moves to narrow independence of Fed, along with other Wall Street overseers","The Trump administration took another swing at the Federal Reserve’s independence late Tuesday with a new executive order that seeks more control over federal agencies that have traditionally operated with day-to-day autonomy.
Even as the White House executive order said it would protect the Fed’s monetary policy — including its powers to set interest rates — it sought to scoop up all of Wall Street’s biggest regulators and make their budgets subject to the authority of the White House budget office.
It’s just the latest political attack on the Fed, a 111-year institution responsible for setting short-term borrowing costs that trickle through the financial sector and influence what millions of consumers and businesses pay to borrow money. It also plays a key role supervising and regulating Wall Street.
It’s possible little of Tuesday’s order will ultimately apply to the Fed because Congress established the central bank to operate with significant independence in determining how to use its resources. The order notes it does not seek to “impair” any authorities Congress has given to independent agencies.
“Time, the courts and Congress will ultimately determine whether and how much of this sticks,” said Scott Alvarez, a former general counsel at the Fed. “What’s important at this point is the President has announced he wants to dismantle a system of independent agencies that Congress has established and the courts have upheld and wants to shift funding decisions from Congress and the appropriations process to himself.”
Laws and norms have traditionally protected the Fed from the executive branch, with the aim of demonstrating to global markets that U.S. monetary policy isn’t at the mercy of the political whims of the White House. But President Donald Trump has made clear he thinks he <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/23/trump-federal-reserve/"" target=_blank>should get more of a say</a>.
The Fed declined to comment. A White House spokesman had no immediate comment.
For their part, Fed officials of their own volition have already made a series of decisions in the first weeks of the Trump administration to align internal policies with lawful directives from the White House, with the aim of avoiding a dispute with the administration, Fed watchers say.
Almost immediately after Trump was sworn into office, Fed officials announced a suspension of “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs, as well as a systemwide hiring freeze, according to emails reviewed by The Washington Post. The Fed is also trying to align to Trump’s return-to-office policies, with officials considering reductions to remote work.
“As has been our practice over many administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,” Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell told reporters earlier this month.
The difference in the move on Tuesday is that the White House appears to be trying to force the changes on the Fed when it comes to its oversight and regulation of Wall Street. The order requires that independent agencies submit major regulations to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review.
The new order also states that only the president and the attorney general — “subject to the President’s supervision and control” — will interpret law on behalf of the executive branch, blocking independent federal agencies from adopting legal interpretations that are at odds with the Trump White House.
OMB is run by Russell Vought, a fiscal hawk who helped to craft Project 2025, a controversial policy blueprint that has informed Trump’s return to the White House. Specifically, Project 2025 suggests the Fed’s role should be narrowed to only keeping the money supply stable, <a href=""https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-24.pdf"" target=_blank>not regulating Wall Street banks or acting as a lender of last resort when big banks fail</a>, because “political pressure has led the Federal Reserve to use its power to regulate banks as a way to promote politically favorable initiatives,” the paper said.
Fed watchers say the central bank’s actions to date suggest it wants to choose its battles carefully, avoiding conflicts with Trump that don’t directly threaten its control over monetary policy. The Fed has fiercely protected its independence since the high-inflation era of the 1970s. That period was partly driven by the central bank’s own missteps under pressure from President Richard M. Nixon to keep rates low, despite signs that the economy was overheating, to help his reelection campaign.
“The Fed is willing to go all 15 rounds with the sitting president to preserve its ability to make interest-rate policy separate from the Oval Office,” said Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania. “It is not willing to separate itself from the Oval Office on nearly anything else.”
“The White House — for now, at least — appears to insist on precisely this balance of power,” he added. “The question only remains whether President Trump and those closest to him will continue to regard even monetary policy as outside of his immediate control.”
For months, Trump officials have privately discussed ways to streamline the alphabet soup of agencies responsible for overseeing Wall Street. One approach envisions consolidating agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency into a single entity, according to people familiar with the discussions granted anonymity to convey internal plans.
Lacking sufficient votes in the Senate to overhaul the financial regulatory system, the White House’s order could provide a backup approach to trying to consolidate at least some control of financial regulation, even if it remains unlikely the Fed’s regulatory functions wind up under the direct purview of the president. The Fed, the FDIC and the comptroller are the three primary federal banking regulators.
It’s not the first time the Fed has moved quickly to align its policies with those of a new administration. At the start of Trump’s first term, the central bank similarly adopted a hiring freeze ordered across the government by the president.
This time, the political environment is more hostile to the Fed. During Trump’s first term, some Republican senators backed Powell against repeated efforts by Trump to undermine the independence of the Fed. Most of those lawmakers are no longer in office.
The push for more say over the Fed comes after Michael Barr, the Fed’s vice chairman for banking supervision, last month said he would step down from the role at the end of this month, avoiding a potential legal fight over whether Trump had the authority to demote him.
The Fed’s move to comply with earlier orders from the White House has been evident in the way it immediately removed public-facing webpages highlighting the board’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts following a directive from Trump that agencies cease such work.
The shift is notable at some regional Fed banks. At the New York Fed, officials canceled a reception scheduled for Thursday and also withdrew from a summer fellowship program that aimed to support women and underrepresented groups in economics, according to a social media post from Yana van der Meulen Rodgers, an economist at Rutgers University. A bank official attributed the cancellations to the suspension of DEI work, according to an email reviewed by The Post.
The New York Fed declined to comment.
At the Kansas City Fed, top officials told staff members on Halloween — less than a week before the presidential election — that the bank’s commitment to DEI “remains steadfast,” according to a message to the bank’s roughly 2,000 employees reviewed by The Post.
That contrasted sharply with a Jan. 28 message from the top two officials at each Fed bank announcing the system was “temporarily pausing” diversity initiatives through at least February.

"Trump, Modi aim to cut U.S. trade gap with India amid global tariff concerns","The United States and India are working toward a deal that aims to cut America’s sizable trade gap with India as New Delhi pledges to buy more U.S. energy, weapons and civil nuclear power, President Donald Trump said Thursday during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington.
The meeting with Modi — the fourth foreign leader to visit Trump in the White House since his inauguration — was one of the earliest measures of how Trump will handle his relationship with New Delhi. The partnership is a pillar of Washington’s strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, but one that is beset with trouble spots on illegal immigration, visas, America’s large trade deficit with India and controversies over India’s attempted assassination of a Sikh activist on American soil.
During the news conference, Trump sought to emphasize the friendship between Washington and New Delhi, even as he announced shortly before it that the United States would implement a “reciprocal” tariff policy that would tax foreign goods at the same rate that other nations apply to American products, potentially complicating talks with India.
Trump said the United States will increase military sales to India by “many billions of dollars” and would consider providing New Delhi F-35 fighter jets. He reiterated his dismay with India’s tariffs toward the United States, but said the two countries will negotiate a trade deal that will ensure a “level playing field.” Trump said India will reform its laws to welcome U.S. nuclear technology into its domestic market.
On the issue of immigration — which sparked outrage in India after the Trump administration sent deportees back to the country in shackles on military fights — Modi said New Delhi will comply with Trump’s desires. “We are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they have absolutely no right to be in that country,” Modi said.
In one of the few moments the Indian prime minister spoke English, Modi became the latest leader trying to foster a personal relationship with Trump. The Indian leader borrowed from Trump’s “Make America Great Again” rhetoric to announce his own vision: Make India Great Again, or MIGA, he said in English, adding that the two countries could continue to help each other.
“When it’s MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes ‘mega’ — a mega-partnership for prosperity,” the Indian prime minister said, according to a translator.
The United States is India’s <a href=""https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-india/"">largest</a> trading partner, buying more than 18 percent of all its exports. India exported $45 billion more to the United States than it imported, and Trump is keen to shrink that deficit. The lack of parity, as well as lingering frustration from a trade deal that never materialized during his first term, drove Trump to describe India on the campaign trail last year as a “very big abuser” of tariffs.
In a call with Modi <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/readout-of-president-donald-j-trumps-call-with-prime-minister-modi-of-india/"">last month</a> — the second such conversation between the two leaders since the American election — Trump stressed the “importance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship,” according to a White House readout.
Modi visited Washington <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/indias-modi-meet-trump-with-planned-tariff-concessions-2025-02-10/"">armed</a> with concessions aimed at averting a trade war and staving off damaging tariffs on the world’s fifth-largest economy. The concessions include a commitment to significantly boost purchases of American energy. New Delhi has already reduced tariffs on high-end American motorcycles — a fixation for Trump, who repeatedly called the 100 percent duty on Harley-Davidsons “unacceptable.”
India signaled it was open to offering tariff concessions for imports from the United States in several sectors, including electronics, medical equipment and chemicals, an analyst familiar with the matter said. The Modi administration is looking at potential deals on U.S. agriculture exports and nuclear energy investments, the analyst added, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Reuters earlier reported the possible concessions.
Ahead of his meeting with Trump, Modi on Thursday met with the president’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz. He also held meetings with billionaire Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, according to Indian officials. On Wednesday, he held talks with Trump’s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard.
During the news conference Thursday evening, the two leaders said a key path to shrinking America’s trade gap with India involves selling billions of dollars worth of energy, especially liquid natural gas, to India. The Biden administration had paused liquid natural gas project approvals as part of its effort to curb climate change. While the leaders were speaking, Waltz posted on X: “Drill Baby Drill = Buy Baby Buy.”
Modi said that India and the United States will collaborate on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum technology. Trump said the United States would also extradite one of the plotters of the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai.
Also, Modi announced that India was moving to change its liability laws to enable U.S. civil nuclear energy firms to sell reactors there. The law currently puts liability on the supplier, not the operator.
Such a move would be “a long-sought win for the Trump administration,” said Lindsey Ford, White House director for South Asia in the Biden administration. “But Modi’s decision to announce a similar agreement with France one day prior is a reminder for the United States that U.S. technology will not be the only game in town.”
A sign of the growing confidence between the two governments was Trump’s statement that his administration was open to considering selling the vaunted F-35 stealth fighter jet to India, a weapons platform the United States makes available to only its closest and most trusted allies and partners.
But the weapon is costly and India would need to “dramatically overhaul and upgrade its industrial security procedures to better protect against espionage and technology leakage,” said Sameer Lalwani, a senior expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace.
“It’s a gesture of trust” that Trump was even willing to contemplate that, he said. But the Indians are intent on building their own fighter jets, he said.
There would also be significant national security concerns with selling the fifth-generation fighter to India, which has recently fielded Russian S-400 air defense systems. Operating the two near one another enhances the risk that the Russian air defenses could acquire data that compromises the fighter’s stealth signature, and could be used by Russia or China to better detect and target American F-35s, he said.
The trip also came in the wake of tensions around immigration. Last week, scenes of the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/modi-trump-white-house-india-immigration-tariffs/"">dramatic deportation of more than 100 Indians</a>, who were sent back in shackles on a military jet, caused enormous embarrassment to Modi domestically. India is a major source of illegal immigration to the United States. As of 2022, it accounted for 725,000 out of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, according to the Pew Research Center.
Over the Christmas holiday, far-right activists in Trump’s base engaged in a “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/27/h-1b-visas-elon-musk-trump-immigration/"">civil war</a>” with Musk and other senior Trump allies over the need for a skilled-worker visa program that Silicon Valley has long relied on. Many Indians decried the backlash as “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/07/india-maga-h1b-visa-america/"">racist</a>.”





Modi said he did not discuss with Trump whether the American president would take action on the U.S. court case against Gautam Adani, an Indian billionaire and ally of the Indian prime minister accused of bribery schemes.
Trump and Modi have forged a positive relationship since their first meeting in 2017, punctuated by reciprocal mass rallies — “Howdy Modi” in Houston in 2019 and “Namaste Trump” in Ahmedabad, India, in 2020. Their bond stems from a shared strategic interest in countering China as well as the cultivation of a strongman image.
Washington has over the past 20 years grown closer to New Delhi, slowly diminishing India’s decades-long dependence on Russian arms, for instance, though it has been buying large quantities of Russian oil.
Heightened tensions with China after deadly border clashes in 2020 helped drive India closer to the United States, which has provided intelligence and equipment, including leased Predator drones, to help India defend its frontier.
Trump in his first term revived a grouping known as “the Quad,” consisting of India, Japan, the United States and Australia, widely seen as a counterweight to China’s growing influence in the region. The Biden administration advanced the initiative, and analysts say that Trump may push the group in a more security-oriented direction.
The two countries established <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/01/31/india-us-tech-defense/"">a significant partnership</a> in emerging technology during the Biden administration, announcing for instance co-production plans for military jet engines and armored infantry vehicles.
One area that is likely to have a lower profile now is human rights, analysts said. The attempted assassination of the Sikh activist in 2023 caused tension between the two governments and led to murder-for-hire charges against an Indian intelligence official, who has since left the government.
Administration officials declined to comment on the matter on Thursday.
“I think now that issue is somewhat behind us,” said Lisa Curtis, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a White House South Asia aide in Trump’s first term.
Trump also sought to flatter his Indian counterpart, grinning as he responded to a question about who won their negotiations.
“He’s a much tougher negotiator than me,” Trump said. “He’s a much better negotiator than me.”

"CFPB prepares to end lease on headquarters building, ahead of expected cuts","The Trump administration is laying the groundwork to close the headquarters building for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in downtown Washington, the latest signal officials are planning to make significant cuts to the agency with broad authority over the consumer finance market.
CFPB officials this week notified the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that the bureau plans to terminate its long-term lease on the building, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to convey internal plans.
The Comptroller, which regulates large national banks, owns the boxy Brutalist structure that has housed the bureau since October 2011.

Justice Dept. hires for court battles as Trump slashes other agencies,"The Justice Department is recruiting new attorneys to help defend President Donald Trump’s immigration and other policies in court, according to public job postings, department officials and legal experts.
The aim is to create a cadre of lawyers with the skills and willingness to back the administration as it gears up for legal challenges on <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/24/birthright-citizenship-democrats-lawsuits/"" target=_blank>birthright citizenship</a>, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/25/guantanamo-trump-migrants-deportations-venezuela/"" target=_blank>sending migrants</a> to Guantánamo Bay, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/26/doge-federal-workforce-firings-job-cuts/"" target=_blank>federal workforce firings</a>, deep spending cuts and more.
The hirings are largely to fill openings created by the high number of civil division attorneys who have resigned since the 2024 presidential election, according to people familiar with the situation, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals and to discuss sensitive information.
But the effort also gives the Justice Department an opportunity to bring a slew of attorneys who align ideologically with the president into career positions in high-profile sections of the department.
Multiple job postings say the Justice Department is seeking “many” attorneys to work in its Federal Programs Branch and the Office of Immigration Litigation. Both departments are in the civil division, and their attorneys would be at the forefront of deportation fights and defending the most controversial executive branch policies, including a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/25/trump-refugee-ban-blocked/"" target=_blank>refugee ban</a>, terminations of government workers and the slashing of government agencies.
The attorneys would work under senior political appointees being hired to the Justice Department, many of whom are attorneys from conservative law firms and Republican state governments.
“President Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda is a top national security priority that this Department of Justice is prepared to vigorously defend whenever challenged in court,” a spokesperson for the department said in a statement.
The Justice Department is also planning to temporarily assign people to the civil divisions from other offices to defend Trump administration policies, according to a public listing on LinkedIn. At least some of those detailees could come from the civil rights division — an area of the Justice Department that is expected to have dwindling workload demands during the Trump administration.
And attorneys in departments that do not typically deal with immigration enforcement are being asked to handle some immigration matters, the people familiar with the situation said.
The job listings, coupled with interviews with current and former Justice Department officials, suggest that the Trump administration is preparing for extensive and prolonged legal battles in court, with the department seeking both trial attorneys and those who specialize in the appeals process.
Already, the Trump administration is facing more than 80 lawsuits over its efforts to dramatically reshape the federal government and national policies. Several initiatives have been temporarily blocked by lower-court judges, and so far two have reached the Supreme Court.
While many federal agencies are slashing probationary employees and laying off workers en masse, the Justice Department workforce has largely remained intact since Trump took office.
His administration has pushed out or transferred top career officials who held powerful jobs in agency, creating uncertainty and mistrust among the career workforce by according to people familiar. But it has not fired or laid off large swaths of rank and file attorneys or staff.
Still, there has been high staff turnover in key divisions, creating an opportunity for the Trump administration to hire more career attorneys who strongly support its legal positions and approach.
In some government agencies, the federal hiring freeze mandated by the Trump White House has meant that they cannot replace people who quit. At Justice — with many jobs focused on Trump’s priorities of boosting deportations and combating violent crime — the hirings have continued.
Around a third of the 130 attorneys in the Federal Programs Branch have quit the Justice Department since Election Day, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. More resignations are expected as the workload and demands pile up, these people said.
While federal law would prohibit Justice Department officials from asking about the political ideologies during the hiring process of career employees, legal experts said that the federal programs branch is always entwined with White House policies. In the Biden administration, for example, attorneys in this division defended the president’s student loan forgiveness plans, covid mandates, challenges to firearm regulations and more.
People who are strongly against Trump administration policies would be unlikely to apply for a job that would put them at the forefront of defending those policies, people familiar with how the branch works said.
In general, the office is filled with career staffers, a group of whom may disagree with any given administration, the people said. Career staffers and political appointees are supposed to work together to find strong strategies for defending presidential policies that meet legal muster — a process that often entails disagreements and workshopping legal arguments.
But some attorneys are frustrated because they are being asked simply to defend Trump’s policies, with little room for discussion or dissent, according to a former civil division employee who is familiar with the branch’s current dynamics.
The Office of Immigration Litigation is a division of more than 300 attorneys who typically handle the process of stripping citizenship from immigrants who commit crimes or have used fraud on their naturalization applications. These attorneys also defend the government when there is an appeal of a decision made in the administrative immigration courts.

An attorney from the Office of Immigration Litigation was also listed on the Trump administration’s civil lawsuits against the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, which seek to block state and local protections for undocumented immigrants. Involvement in cases like this is unusual for the Office of Immigration Litigation, people familiar with the office said.
The Trump administration has also created a division focused on fighting what are known as “sanctuary cities,” which are typically Democratic cities with a policy of protecting immigrants who are in the country illegally and not cooperating with federal authorities to deport them.
Justice Department officials have transferred veteran career officials from other divisions — many of whom have little background in immigration law — to this office, giving them the option of quitting if they do not want to work there.
The office is reporting to the deputy attorney general. Officials say it is up and running, though it is unclear what litigation the office is working on.",True

"College enrollment rebounds, surpassing pre-pandemic levels","Student head counts at the nation’s colleges and universities has rebounded, according to a new national report, with total enrollment numbers higher than in fall 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic disrupted higher education.
The <a href=""https://nscresearchcenter.org/current-term-enrollment-estimates/"">report</a> from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, released Thursday, found undergraduate enrollment neared 16 million in fall 2024, while graduate enrollment climbed to 3.2 million. All told, total enrollment was up 4.5 percent in the fall compared with the previous year.
Thursday’s report arrives a week after the Clearinghouse said a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/01/14/college-freshman-enrollment-increase-data-error/"">“methodological error”</a> skewed its preliminary calculation of the number of first-year students who enrolled in fall 2024. The center initially said freshman enrollment dropped 5 percent, but later discovered that some college freshmen were incorrectly labeled as dual-enrolled in high school and college classes.
The Clearinghouse has been a trusted source for enrollment trends in higher education because it collects information from 97 percent of the 3,600 degree-granting institutions in the country. The center produces enrollment data sooner than the <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/timing-of-ipeds-data-collection#:~:text=Provisional%20data%20are%20first%20released,year%20for%20some%20survey%20components)."">Education Department</a>, which typically has a nearly year-long time lag.
Some observers questioned why it took the center months to identify its error, especially when previous reports indicated a nascent rebound in higher-education enrollment.
“Our sensitivity to abnormally large changes was somewhat reduced because we had a host of ready explanations for why we might be seeing these declines,” Doug Shapiro, the research center’s executive director, said on a call with reporters Wednesday. “It would have surprised us in a normal year, but in the year in which we had issues with the FAFSA, changes in the economy … and all other kinds of things that could be driving a change like that, kind of dulled our sensors.”
The preliminary report the Clearinghouse released in October relied on reporting from half of colleges and universities that submit data to the center. Thursday’s report, however, is based on the vast majority of colleges and uses a different methodology to determine freshman enrollment.
According to the final fall numbers, freshman head counts grew 5.5 percent, driven by the enrollment of students over age 21. The number of 18-year-olds heading to college also climbed by 3.4 percent but is still below pre-pandemic levels. Traditional-age freshmen grew at the highest rates among students from low-income neighborhoods, particularly at community colleges.
“We saw larger declines initially among low-income students during the pandemic, so some of this may be a return to normal,” Shapiro said. “But it is hard to speculate what’s driving that difference.”
Community colleges, which bore the brunt of enrollment losses during the pandemic, are now reporting some of the strongest enrollment gains, although they remain below pre-pandemic levels. Those with a focus on vocational education witnessed double-digit growth for the second year in a row. Students are also flocking to certificate programs, where enrollments are now 28.5 percent above 2019 levels, according to the Clearinghouse.
Enrollment in bachelor’s and associate’s degree programs is also up, by 2.9 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively, but these remain below 2019 levels. Student head counts are up across all regions, with the Northeast recording the first gain in enrollment since before the pandemic.",False
House Republicans announce panel to continue investigation into Jan. 6,"House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) announced a new select subcommittee to continue House Republicans’ investigation into the events leading up to and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The committee will be chaired by Rep.

It will be under the purview of the House Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio.)
Loudermilk’s team published a 128-interim report last month chronicling investigators’ findings and has repeatedly said more work was needed to build on his panel’s findings.
“House Republicans are proud of our work so far in exposing the false narratives peddled by the politically motivated January 6 Select Committee during the 117th Congress, but there is still more work to be done,” Loudermilk said in an emailed statement. “We are establishing this Select Subcommittee to continue our efforts to uncover the full truth that is owed to the American people.

Trump administration freezes funds to Palestinian security forces,"JERICHO, West Bank — The Trump administration has stopped all funding to the Palestinian Authority security forces as part of the global freeze on foreign assistance, according to U.S. and Palestinian officials.
The freeze comes at a critical time for the embattled authority as it struggles to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/11/palestinian-authority-secuirty-forces-west-bank-faq/"" target=_blank>maintain its rule</a> in pockets of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and jockeys to govern a postwar Gaza Strip. The security forces, which are chronically underfunded and widely unpopular, are nonetheless <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/05/palestinian-authority-security-forces-gaza/"" target=_blank>considered a linchpin to the Palestinian Authority’s ability to maintain law and order</a> in both territories.
Washington last stopped direct aid to the authority during Trump’s first term but continued to fund training and reform for the security forces. Exercises and courses are run through the Jerusalem-based Office of the Security Coordinator — formerly known as the U.S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority — which is made up of a consortium of countries.
Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, spokesman for the Palestinian security forces, told The Washington Post that the United States was considered a “big donor to the PA projects” that included security training for the forces.
A former Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue said that the Palestinian Authority security forces were “not affected in any meaningful way” by the freeze and that “other donors have committed to make up the shortfall.”
But the freeze has already led to cuts in some training, a colonel at the authority’s Central Training Institute for security forces told The Post on Tuesday. He spoke on the condition of anonymity per his office’s protocol.
A meeting planned with American officials this month to assess the authority’s operation targeting militants in the Jenin refugee camp — which stopped after Israeli forces invaded last month — was postponed and has not been rescheduled, he said. Washington was also funding the building of a virtual shooting range, which the institute needs because Israel will not permit the importation of bullets for live-fire training sessions, the colonel said. Though the project was almost completed, the institute is seeking alternative funders because of the U.S. freeze, he said.
Confirmation of the aid freeze comes amid widespread confusion about programs the Trump administration is saving or suspending.
U.S. officials have been loath to specify <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/29/pepfar-trump-hiv-aids-aid-pause/"" target=_blank>what programs</a> are spared under exemptions issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio for “lifesaving” assistance, aid to Israel, HIV prevention programs and other priorities. And even in cases when exemptions apply, aid organizations have in many cases been unable to continue to work because Rubio’s directives have effectively shut down the payment systems required to draw down funds.
The United States has for years supported the Palestinian Authority security forces, viewing them as critical to Israel’s security. The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has provided approximately $1.1 billion in civilian security and justice assistance to support the authority’s security forces since 2007, the State Department said last year.
The Biden administration also backed proposals for the Palestinian Authority to play a key role in postwar Gaza, which both Israel and Hamas, the authority’s internal rival, oppose.
The authority is struggling to control a new generation of Palestinian militancy in the West Bank that’s centered in the territory’s northern refugee camps and draws support from widespread frustration with the aging authority leadership, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, who is 89.

The State Department said the funding is under review but did not provide clarity on when a determination is likely to be made. “The Department and USAID paused nearly all foreign assistance,” the department said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Agency for International Development. “The Department of State has granted waivers for critical programming that aligns with Administration priorities in the region.”

"Trump, Maine Gov. Mills spar over executive order on transgender athletes","President Donald Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) briefly sparred Friday over the president’s threat to withhold federal funds from her state if it doesn’t comply with a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/05/transgender-students-trump-executive-order/"" target=_blank>recent executive order barring transgender athletes</a> from competing on women’s sports teams.
In a gathering with a group of governors at the White House, Trump began to talk about one of his signature culture war promises when he asked whether anyone among the governors gathered at the White House was from Maine. The Maine Principals’ Association has said it will not enforce his executive order aiming to ban trans athletes from competing in girls’ sports.
“You better do it because you’re not going to get federal funding,” Trump said to Mills.
“We’re going to follow the law, sir. We’ll see you in court,” she said.
“Enjoy your life after governor because I don’t think you’ll be in elected office,” Trump said to the term-limited governor.
The back-and-forth followed Trump’s remark Thursday to a group of Republican governors that he would withhold federal funds from Maine unless the state complies with his executive order.

Moore hardens criticism of Trump after ‘conspiracy theories and attacks’,"Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) on Monday took a hardened stance toward what he described as a “full crisis situation” manufactured by the still-new Trump administration, a shift in tone after months of careful political maneuvering to preserve any cooperation that the deep-blue state could get from the federal government.
Moore had greeted President Donald Trump’s election victory in November by saying he wanted to work to find <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/08/maryland-governor-wes-moore-trump/"" target=_blank>“common ground”</a> with the incoming president, as long as he could also protect the interests of Maryland residents.
Over the past five weeks, he said, that goal has increasingly seemed unattainable, and on Monday he accused Trump of “kicking children off of Medicaid so we can make space in the budget for tax cuts for billionaires.”
In a response to Moore’s criticisms, the White House struck back at Democrats who have slammed the recent cuts to federal jobs and spending under the guidance of the Elon Musk-led U.S. DOGE Service, also known as the Department of Government Efficiency.
“The Democrats have no plan on how to recover from their embarrassing loss, and it shows,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in an email. “Instead of working to become a party that focuses on the will of the people, they are hell-bent on keeping their heads in the sand and gaslighting on the widely supported mission of DOGE.”
Trump last week appointed Moore to the bipartisan Council of Governors, which works to strengthen state and federal partnerships on national security, disaster response and military coordination.
Moore attended a meeting of governors from across the country in D.C. on Friday. Moore said Republican and Democratic governors had productive and interesting conversations about policy. When Trump showed up, Moore said, it became clear that he did not intend to listen to the state leaders.
“When the president of the United States walked into the room, that’s when things went off the rails,” he said.
Trump <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/22/janet-mills-maine-trump-transgender-athletes/"" target=_blank>clashed with the Democratic governor of Maine</a> over an <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/05/transgender-students-trump-executive-order/"" target=_blank>executive order</a> that bans transgender athletes from competing on girls’ and women’s sports teams, and he threatened to withhold all federal funding from the state if it does not comply. Moore described the president’s remarks as “an hour-long diatribe of conspiracy theories and attacks on my colleagues.”
“I’ve come back from these meetings with all of our nation’s governors … with a full-blown understanding that this is a full crisis situation,” Moore said. “It’s time for all of us to take this moment seriously.”
Already facing a $3 billion budget deficit, Maryland stands to lose a lot amid the administration’s efforts to shrink the federal government and reduce spending.
The state is home to many federal workers who have either lost their jobs in recent weeks or are in danger of losing them amid the Trump administration’s spending cuts. Government contractors and nonprofits who depend on federal grants are also laying off workers and closing shop.
Other changes being contemplated by the administration and a Republican-controlled Congress would further devastate Maryland’s economy, Moore said. Those actions could soon include <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/18/medicaid-cuts-work-requirements-congress-republicans/8f3a7244-edf0-11ef-bd80-8f2ac5c75a8a_story.html"" target=_blank>cuts to Medicaid</a>, reductions in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and a full shutdown of the federal government that would leave tens of thousands of Marylanders temporarily out of work, he said. The governor said he left D.C. on Friday with the feeling that the Trump administration relishes the potential fallout from those decisions.
“Not only is this going to continue; they are going to accelerate,” Moore said.
For months, Moore and <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/governors-trump-whitmer-mills-transgender-musk-tariffs/faebeb86-f22c-11ef-acb5-08900d482a27_story.html"" target=_blank>other Democratic leaders</a> have been trying to navigate the tension between protecting whatever federal resources they can get for their states and voicing their concerns about the president’s words and actions.
Moore<b> </b>was photographed in December smiling and shaking hands with Trump at the Army-Navy football game, a gesture to show good faith.
By the time Moore gave his State of the State address early this month, his rhetoric had begun to shift. He didn’t name Trump, but he lamented the “uncertainty, confusion and chaos” of the first few weeks of the new administration.
Less than a month after that speech, Moore on Monday shared doubts that a partnership can exist between the deeply blue state and the Trump White House.
Moore said governors in both parties were willing to work together on some issues, especially to build a strong economy, but Trump did not engage in the bipartisan conversation.
“I don’t think that anybody, either Democrat or Republican, could walk away from what happened this weekend and say that same measure of cohesion existed between our nation’s governors and the White House,” he said.",False
Murkowski condemns Trump’s pardons to Jan. 6 rioters who assaulted police,"President Donald Trump continues to face criticism from Republican and Democratic senators over his decision on Tuesday to issue pardons to roughly 1,500 criminal defendants involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), one of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial, is the latest to express public disapproval, particularly for the pardons for those convicted of assaulting police officers.
“The Capitol Police officers are the backbone of Congress — every day they protect and serve the halls of democracy. I strongly denounce the blanket pardons given to the violent offenders who assaulted these brave men and women in uniform,” Murkowski wrote on X.
She joins a growing chorus of senators who have condemned Trump’s decision, including Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell (Kentucky) — who said, “No one should excuse violence. And particularly violence against police officers” — and Thom Tillis (North Carolina), who said he “just can’t agree” with Trump’s clemency moves.",False
"Israel is building outposts in Syria, raising local fears of occupation","JUBATA AL-KHASHAB, Syria — As the Israeli military swept into a string of Syrian villages nearly two months ago, the soldiers assured locals that the presence would be temporary — the aim limited to seizing weapons and securing the area after the collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
But the earthmoving vehicles that followed suggest a more permanent presence.
“They are building military bases. How is that temporary?” asked Mohammed Muraiwid, the mayor of Jubata al-Khashab, who has watched Israel troops construct a new military outpost on the edge of his village.

Satellite imagery examined by The Washington Post shows more than half a dozen structures and vehicles in the walled Israeli base, with nearly identical construction five miles to the south. Both are linked by new dirt roads to territory in the Golan Heights that Israel captured in its 1967 war with its Arab neighbors. An area of cleared land, which experts say appears to be the beginnings of a third base, is visible another few miles south.
Hours after Assad’s grip on his country crumbled in December, Israeli tanks and troops broke through the “Alpha line” that has marked the ceasefire boundary over the past half-century and moved into a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone inside Syrian territory, and in some cases beyond.


Israeli troops now come and go in the 90-square-mile buffer zone, which is supposed to be demilitarized, according to the 1974 ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria. Israel has said it considers that deal void following the Assad regime’s collapse. At its widest, the buffer zone is about six miles across, but at certain points Israeli troops have advanced several miles beyond it, local officials said.

In an interview with The Post on Sunday, Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra described the Israeli advance as a “violation against the Syrian people.”
“This incursion is unjustified,” he said, adding that the Iranian threat at the heart of Israeli concerns over Syria no longer exists. “They had a problem with Iran; we saved them from Iran.”
The Israeli military has the capability to protect its borders from its previous positions, he said, calling on it to withdraw.
The two new construction sites, located within what had until recently been Syrian-controlled territory, appear to be forward observation bases, similar in structure and style to those in the Israeli-held part of the Golan Heights, said William Goodhind, an imagery analyst at Contested Ground. The base in Jubata al-Khashab is more fully developed, while the one to the south appears to be under construction. The former would provide better visibility for troops, while the latter has better access to the area’s road network, as would a third base if built on the area of cleared land farther south, he said. The <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmn3jmm1yo"" target=_blank>BBC originally reported</a> construction at the site in Jubata al-Khashab.

Satellite imagery also shows a new road, located about 10 miles south of the city of Quneitra, stretching from the boundary line to the top of a hill near the village of Kodana, providing Israeli forces with a new surveillance point.

To build the outpost near Jubata al-Khashab, Muraiwid said Israeli bulldozers have ripped down village fruit trees and other trees in part of a protected nature reserve. “We told them we consider this an occupation,” the mayor said.
Since entering Syria, Israeli soldiers have also set up checkpoints, closed roads, raided houses, displaced residents and fired on protesters who have demonstrated against their presence, locals say. At night, patrols have been spotted on back roads with lights turned off, before returning to base.
“No one knows what they were doing. No one dares to ask,” said Budour Hassan, 55, as she picked leaves for tea a few dozen yards from an Israeli roadblock.

In response to questions about the nature and duration of its activities in Syria, the Israel Defense Forces said, “IDF forces are operating in southern Syria, within the buffer zone and at strategic points, to protect the residents of northern Israel.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said the troop presence is indefinite, citing security concerns.
Regarding reports that Israeli troops had fired on protesters, the IDF said it had operated “in accordance with standard operating procedures” after demonstrators had been asked to distance themselves from soldiers.
The push into territory previously controlled by Syria comes at a time when Israel is operating beyond its borders on multiple fronts to keep its enemies at a distance, following Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel, which killed about 1,200 Israelis. In Gaza, Israeli forces have destroyed thousands of buildings within about half a mile of the border fence to establish a “special security zone.” During the war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Israeli military has systematically leveled villages near the border between the two countries.

The  militants who now control the vast majority of Syria are noticeably absent from areas near the boundary. Syria’s new leader, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/29/israel-gaza-war-ceasefire-hostages-hamas-steve-witkoff/"" target=_blank>Ahmed al-Sharaa</a>, has said he is committed to upholding the 1974 agreement that created the demilitarized buffer zone between the Israelis and Syrians.
“Maybe they have a deal with Israel we do not know,” said Hayel al-Abdulla, 77, the tribal leader in the tiny village of Samdaniya al-Gharbiya.
When Israeli troops blocked a road just south of Abdulla’s home with earth and rocks, he said he objected. “I told them this is not Gaza,” he said. “You can’t just block us in.”
The defense minister said a unit of Syrian forces has been prepped to return to old regime positions in the area, some of which are now occupied by Israeli troops. Negotiations are ongoing through both the United Nations and United States to enable them to do so, Abu Qasra said.


Israel has said part of its mission is seizing weapons to prevent attacks on its communities. But Muraiwid said there are none left. When Israeli troops arrived in Muraiwid’s village, they demanded that residents turn over weapons that had been abandoned by fleeing regime troops, he said. Locals agreed to collect the weapons and hand them over to avoid the kind of raids Israeli troops were conducting elsewhere.
They returned twice more. “The third time they came, I told them even if we had weapons, Syria has a new government, and we will give them to our new government,” Muraiwid said, sitting in a carpeted meeting room with expansive views of the surrounding countryside.
The Israeli military said Saturday that its troops in Syria had come under fire and “responded by firing shots.” A group calling itself the Islamic Resistance Front in Syria claimed responsibility. Local rebels played down the incident, saying it had occurred when a local criminal family thought Syrian forces were trying to detain its members.
Over international objections, Israel in 1981 annexed the areas of the Golan Heights it captured from Syria. Israel said the move was necessary to prevent Syrian shelling of farms in Israel’s Galilee region. But the plateau is also vital for Israel’s water supplies, feeding the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River.


The buffer zone includes a dam at a reservoir that supplies water to swaths of southern Syria. There are suspicions among local residents Israel that is making a grab for water and other resources. Despite its operations in the area, the Israeli miliary says it does not control the dam.
For Syrian residents living near the ceasefire line, such as the tribal leader Abdulla, their presence on a geopolitical fault line has meant decades of tumult, caught between Israel and Assad’s regime. Some buildings here remain scarred by battles involving the government, Syrian rebel groups and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, with bullet marks and gaping holes from artillery fire still visible.

Israel has long been determined to curb the presence along the ceasefire line of Iranian-backed militant groups that supported the Assad regime.
In August, Israeli forces began to carve a new 5.5-mile-long trench about 100 feet inside the Syrian side of the boundary fence, according to satellite imagery. The trench cuts through the land of Ahmed Bakr, 35, who lives in a roughly constructed two-bedroom home with his two wives and 10 children. Drones buzzing overhead observe his interactions with visitors.


He is no stranger to interactions with Israelis. Bakr’s 9-year-old daughter was actually born in Israel, under an Israeli initiative to build support and influence on the Syrian side of the buffer zone. During the Syrian civil war, Israel also ferried wounded rebel fighters past the dividing fence to be treated in Israeli hospitals and, according to local officials, funded a local faction to fight the Assad government and its Hezbollah allies.
Now, the Israelis carry out foot patrols and raid houses, and a new Israeli base has cut villagers off from grazing lands, forcing the locals to buy more grain for their livestock, they say. “Everyone is worried, not only me,” Bakr said.
Among those concerns is the fear they may be displaced. The regional capital of Madinat al-Baath, a mile from the ceasefire line, was built in 1986 by the Syrian government for families displaced from the Golan Heights in previous conflicts with Israel. Most of the 100,000 Syrians estimated to have lived on the territory captured by Israel were never allowed to return. Now, an Israeli tank sits outside the governorate building formerly occupied by Assad’s Baath Party. Locals dart past a street that has been cut off by a makeshift Israeli roadblock of rubble and a downed streetlamp.
“We will not let the same thing happen again,” said Bilal Suleiman, head of the local municipality. “There is not a one-in-a-million possibility we will leave.”

Most of those ordered from their homes during the initial advance of Israeli troops across the line in December have been allowed to return. But some families said they have been blocked from doing so.
“Most people were allowed back, but they told me my house is a military zone,” said Jadallah Hamoud, 52, who stopped to eye the blocked road leading to his home as he returned from buying bread. He said he is staying with friends in a nearby town with his wife and eight children and managed to get another farmer to take in his two cows and 15 sheep. But he had to turn his dogs and chickens loose, with no place to keep them.


The IDF denied that families are still displaced.
In an effort to shed its associations with Assad’s Baath Party, the town renamed itself Madinat al-Salaam, or City of Peace, in December. “Maybe they didn’t understand the message,” said Qasem al-Mohammad, 57, gesturing toward the tank.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington on behalf of six service members, challenges the order’s legality on constitutional grounds, stating that affected service members have built their lives around military service.
The order said the U.S. military has been “afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists” and that “many mental and physical health conditions are incompatible with active duty.”
The Defense Department said in a statement that it “will fully execute and implement all directives outlined in Executive Orders by the President, ensuring they are carried out with utmost professionalism, efficiency, and in alignment with national security objectives. We will provide status updates as we are able.”
Trump’s action is a dangerous rollback of rights and equality, a key component of global human rights agreements to which the United States has been party, said Karla Gonzales Garcia, director of Amnesty International USA’s gender, sexuality and identity program.
“In its attacks on transgender people, whether in military service or through trying to redefine sex and gender in an attempt to erase transgender people, the Trump administration has made hate and discrimination its agenda,” she said in a statement. “Not only will today’s directive violate the human rights of thousands of Americans, it also sends a dangerous message to the rest of the world.”",True

New database gives public easy access to 3D primate skeletons,"A new <a href=""https://bit.ly/3dprimates"" target=_blank>database</a> offers access to over 6,000 3D scans of primate skeletons housed in the American Museum of Natural History, Stony Brook University, the National Museum of Natural History, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium, researchers announced.
Hosted on MorphoSource, an online repository of world heritage and natural history data, the resource contains nearly 400 digitized adult primates, including great apes (orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees) and monkeys from Africa, Asia and South America. The scans include everything from hands to feet to skulls, and most animals are represented by near-complete skeletons.
The database was designed to help those in the field of phenomics — the study of animals’ physical characteristics. Studying primate characteristics requires accessing their skeletons — some of which may be hard to study because of distance, financial resources or concerns about the specimens themselves.
“One of our concerns for the primate collection, which is very heavily used, has always been wear and tear of the specimens,” Nancy Simmons, curator in charge of the American Museum of Natural History’s mammalogy department, said in a news <a href=""https://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/primate-digital-collections"" target=_blank>release</a>. “We’ve seen different sets of researchers measuring and scanning the same items again and again.

Simmons and her co-authors described the collection in a December <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-04261-5"" target=_blank>paper</a> in Scientific Data. They say it is the largest 3D morphological dataset of its kind in primates.
“Open data sharing is essential to equal advancement in all fields of science,” they write, noting that 3D scanning of important specimens is often an on-demand process provided to individuals. Making the collection freely available, they write, will enable more comprehensive research and could advance the study of human origins, which is closely linked to that of primate evolution.

<b>President Donald Trump had two encounters this week that roiled global politics: </b>A White House meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II and a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the former, Trump <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/11/trump-jordan-gaza/"" target=_blank>doubled down on a plan</a> to take hold of the Gaza Strip while compelling 2 million plus Palestinians to leave, likely for permanent exile in neighboring Egypt and Jordan.
The proposal <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/06/trump-gaza-plan-real-estate/"" target=_blank>is a nonstarter</a> for the monarch and for virtually every government in the Middle East outside Israel. But Jordan counts on significant annual aid from the United States and Abdullah politely sat alongside Trump as the latter reminded the world of the possibility of that assistance being shut off. After their meeting, the Jordanian king issued a statement rejecting Palestinian “displacement.” Arab officials are putting together a different proposal for the administration and reconstruction of Gaza that will allow its population to remain.
The next day, Trump startled allies in Europe with <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/12/trump-putin-talks-ukraine-war/"" target=_blank>a call to Putin</a>. The overture broke years of silence between the White House and the Kremlin, and preceded news of a potential U.S.-Russia summit facilitated by Saudi Arabia — raising the possibility of a deal hatched without either Ukrainians or any other<b> </b>Europeans at the table. In subsequent comments, Trump insisted his transatlantic interlocutors would not be sidelined, but also added that he wanted Russia back in diplomatic formats like the Group of Seven nations (no longer the Group of Eight since Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014).
European officials feared Trump and his lieutenants, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was in meetings on the continent, were openly giving away concessions to the Kremlin before meaningful negotiations. Both Hegseth and Trump have all but rejected the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, while the former said Ukraine would not realistically regain much of its territory lost to Russia.
<b>Ukraine since Russia’s full-fledged invasion in 2022 has been locked in an existential fight for survival. </b>Kyiv won’t accept foreign powers forcing concessions on it and is wary of Trump reducing Ukraine’s leverage in a hypothetical deal with Russia.
“Your politicians have lost their dignity,” a Ukrainian military officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/trump-putin-call-europe-ukraine-reaction/"" target=_blank>told my colleagues</a>. “Ukraine’s betrayal after Afghanistan will have catastrophic consequences for America’s perception in the world,” he said, referring to the Taliban takeover that came after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Trump doesn’t seem worried about such perceptions, and has cast himself as an unorthodox peacemaker willing to have discussions and create solutions others could not. He also seems squishy on Ukraine’s sovereignty, suggesting that the country’s wealth of critical minerals should be reserved for the United States in exchange for security guarantees. In a TV interview earlier this week, he said there was a chance that Ukraine “may be Russian someday.” At a White House presser Thursday evening, Trump didn’t answer a journalist’s question about what concessions Russia should itself make in a peace deal, but reiterated his opposition to Ukraine joining NATO.
The language coming out of Washington has frustrated officials in Europe. “It’s appeasement. It has never worked,” E.U. foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. “It is clear that any deal behind our backs will not work. Any agreement will need also Ukraine and Europe being part of it.”
“Trump always speaks about ‘peace through strength,’ and that is precisely the right approach with the Russians,” a senior European official <a href=""https://archive.is/BP5sR#selection-5883.110-5887.204"" target=_blank>told the Wall Street Journal</a>. “But here we have not really seen the strength part yet.”
<b>When it comes to Gaza, Trump is even more dismissive</b>. He believes the United States would simply assume responsibility for the territory, a “demolition site,” and make it into the “Riviera” of the Middle East, no matter the expulsion of its inhabitants. “We’re going to take it, we’re going to hold it, we’re going to cherish it,” Trump said of Gaza, while scoffing at any question of paying for it — “there’s nothing to buy,” <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ABCNews/videos/were-gonna-have-gaza-theres-nothing-to-buypres-trump-doubled-down-on-his-plan-fo/629356416166279/"" target=""_blank"">he told reporters</a>.
Palestinians do not see their homeland as “nothing.” Even amid the devastation of their homes, Gaza’s traumatized population does not want to lose its rights to the land. Tensions are <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/09/trump-gaza-development-intervention/"" target=_blank>fraying the fragile ceasefire</a> between Israel and militant group Hamas, raising the prospect of a resumption of Israel’s bombardments that have already flattened most of the territory’s civilian infrastructure and killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.
“Palestinians do not need President Trump to talk about Gaza as if it were an empty hotel room that needs redesigning,” wrote Mosab Abu Toha, a Palestinian poet from Gaza, <a href=""https://archive.is/IKTeP#selection-635.0-635.117"" target=""_blank"">in the New Yorker</a>. He pointed to the vast humanitarian need in the territory — assistance which Israel, despite ceasefire commitments, <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-says-aid-flows-into-gaza-have-risen-since-ceasefire-including-shelter-items-2025-02-11/"" target=""_blank"">may still be restricting</a> — and the urgent need to start clearing tons of debris. “The people who shape this future need to be us Palestinians,” he added, “not the people who made Gaza look like a demolition site, or who now seem to think that an entire people should be demolished, too.”
Diplomats across the Arab world have echoed this position, as have European politicians and U.N. officials. “It’s strange at the moment to be in a period when statecraft seems to have been replaced by real estate craft,” Tom Fletcher, the United Nations undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, said of Trump’s plan in <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/09/trump-gaza-development-intervention/"" target=_blank>an interview Sunday after a tour of Gaza</a>. “I was asking a lot of people what they thought, and every single one of them said, ‘We’re not going anywhere. We’ll rebuild our homes again and again and again as we always have done.’”
<b>Trump’s plans for Gaza are not just about the fancies of a real estate tycoon. </b>His apparent belief that Gaza can be emptied of its population is celebrated by the Israeli right, as prominent politicians have for months <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/05/wv-israel-hamas/"" target=""_blank"">eyed the occupation and settlement</a> of Gaza, as well as <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/25/israel-ethnic-cleansing-gaza-settlements/"" target=""_blank"">the expulsion of its Palestinian inhabitants</a>. It “rewards the policies of the Israel government that is the most extremist, right-wing in the history of the Israeli state,” Aaron David Miller, a veteran former U.S. diplomat who worked for decades on Israeli-Palestinian issues, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/09/trump-gaza-development-intervention/"" target=""_blank"">told my colleague Karen DeYoung</a>.
And if the political aspirations of Palestinians are irrelevant to Trump, so too are the political anxieties of Ukrainians — much to the pleasure of those in the Kremlin’s inner circle. “We are entering a new 21st century, and it’s not going to look like the 20th,” Konstantin Malofeyev, a Russian tycoon who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions for<b> </b>his role financing pro-Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/trump-russia-ukraine-territory-peace-deal/"" target=_blank>told my colleagues</a>. “We are returning to the era of traditional big states, great powers and to a balance of interests.”",False
"Labor Department blocked from sharing data with DOGE, email says","The U.S. Labor Department has been temporarily blocked by court order from sharing data with Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service, according to an email from a union that represents federal government workers. The email was obtained by The Washington Post.
The temporary order arrives after DOGE representatives visited the Labor Department this week, seeking sensitive data that the agency keeps. In response, a group of powerful unions swiftly sued DOGE in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday, arguing that DOGE’s work was illegal and has “already been catastrophic.”
“Thanks to our swift response and the support of our labor partners, we successfully obtained a temporary order preventing DOL from sharing any data with DOGE,” said an email sent Thursday to rank-and-file Labor Department staffers by AFGE Local 12, a union representing federal government employees.
On Wednesday, a protest led by major unions including the AFL-CIO drew hundreds of people outside the agency’s headquarters in Washington.
The Labor Department manages huge volumes of sensitive data related to the labor market, unemployment claims, disability insurance, workplace health and safety, whistleblower reports and wage theft.
“This order remains in effect until the court rules on the temporary restraining order,” the union email said. “The DOGE will continue to visit but should not be accessing anything.”",True
Vaccine meeting to prepare for coming winter’s flu season canceled,"Trump officials have canceled a federal vaccine advisory committee meeting expected to be held<b> </b>next month that was intended to help select the makeup of next winter’s influenza vaccine.
This is the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/"">second federal vaccine advisory panel that has been postponed</a> or canceled since <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/12/how-rfk-jr-once-long-shot-arrived-precipice-trumps-cabinet/"">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, was sworn in as health and human services secretary.
The Food and Drug Administration notified members of its vaccine advisory committee Wednesday that a planned March 13 meeting was canceled, according to an email sent to members that was read to The Washington Post. No reason was provided.
The email warned members against forwarding the email. It suggested members decline to answer questions from media.
HHS and the FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/10/flu-cases-increase-influenza-cdc/"">Influenza viruses</a> change year to year, so vaccines must be updated annually. Federal health officials pick the flu strains that the vaccine will target in advance of the flu season because the production process takes several months.
The FDA usually holds a meeting of its expert panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, in March to accommodate tight manufacturing deadlines and go over discussions about flu strain selection led by the World Health Organization.
The FDA advisory panel meeting includes public presentations from WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Defense, said Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and a critic of Kennedy’s.
“What is the plan for picking this year’s flu strain?” Offit said.
Last week, Trump officials <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/"">postponed</a> a three-day meeting of the vaccine advisory panel to the CDC that was scheduled to begin Wednesday.
During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy repeatedly denied that he is anti-vaccine, contending that he is simply seeking more data and pledging not to undermine confidence in the shots. But public health experts have long warned that as HHS secretary, Kennedy could use his authority to undermine vaccine safety and effectiveness. A pivotal swing vote in Kennedy’s confirmation, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) said he grappled with his vote but later said he had received a list of commitments from Kennedy that included protecting vaccine oversight.
Kennedy was critical of the CDC vaccine panel during his <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/30/rfk-health-secretary-confirmation-hearings/"">confirmation process</a> and has argued that federal agencies are <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/18/trump-health-firings-fda-cdc/"">captive</a> to the industries they regulate.
“We will remove conflicts of interest on the committees and research partners whenever possible, or balance them with other stakeholders,” Kennedy said in remarks to HHS staff earlier this month.
An executive order issued by President Donald Trump last week to reduce federal bureaucracy said White House officials would identify “unnecessary governmental entities and Federal Advisory Committees that should be terminated on grounds that they are unnecessary.”",True
"Congress ignores looming shutdown to focus on tax cuts, agency layoffs","With President Donald Trump and GOP leaders distracted by other issues, Congress is on the verge of bungling its way into a shutdown of federal agencies in less than three weeks.
Trump and his advisers, particularly Elon Musk, have devoted the first month in office to trying to rip apart federal agencies that they don’t like while also upending traditional foreign policy alliances. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) have battled over how fast to move all of Trump’s agenda, including at least $4.5 trillion in tax cuts at a time when the national debt is ballooning.
But those issues are likely to take months to fully negotiate and navigate through complex procedures. The most pressing problem — keeping the federal government open past the March 14 deadline — has been virtually ignored by top leaders.
And unlike the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/20/government-shutdown-bill-continuing-resolution/"" target=""_blank"">most recent shutdown</a> deadlines, the politics of the moment are not aligned to bring the two parties together with an obvious last-minute deal that simply adds more money for each side’s favored projects.
Instead, many Democrats have grown so livid about Trump and Musk’s <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/08/elon-musk-doge-federal-agencies-cuts-employees/"" target=_blank>dismantling of agencies</a> such as the U.S. Agency for International Development — ignoring laws approved by Congress and signed by previous presidents — that many Democrats say <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/09/democrats-government-shutdown-trump-musk/"" target=_blank>they will oppose</a> a new round of government funding without guarantees that Trump and Musk will abide by these laws.
In outlining what they are seeking, Sen. Patty Murray (Washington), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, <a href=""https://x.com/jackfitzdc/status/1892645594465710532"" target=_blank>summed it up thus on Thursday</a>: “Simply an assurance that, if there’s going to be Democratic votes, that the president and Elon Musk will follow the law and they won’t just take our bill that we worked really hard on and rip it up.”
Republicans know that without any Democratic votes, the government will shut down. To boot, at least a half dozen anti-government conservatives in the House, sometimes several dozen, refuse to vote for even the most basic bill funding the government.
Johnson’s historically narrow majority affords him just one defection to pass something with only Republican votes.
“Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. It is their responsibility to find the votes to pass the final measures,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Connecticut), the ranking minority-party member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement provided to The Washington Post on Friday.
DeLauro labeled Musk “an unchecked billionaire” whose actions have turned this negotiation from a relatively easy one to “not normal times” with a high degree of risk.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who spent 28 years climbing the Appropriations Committee ladder to finally secure the chair’s gavel last month, summed up the dire state of play.
“I believe we’re at impasse. We’ve made four good-faith offers,” Collins told reporters in the Capitol, adding that the Democrats have not made a real counteroffer. “We’ve received only a perfunctory response.”
The divide is epitomized by a pair of collegial committee members who usually forge deals but instead are now casting blame.
Sen. Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) noted that there is general agreement on funding levels that mirror <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/09/30/government-shutdown-averted/"" target=_blank>a deal worked out in 2023</a>. Republicans are willing to divvy up agency funds at those levels even though the leaders who negotiated that pact — Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy — are no longer in office.
“If the Democrats want to do a shutdown, they can do it by simply refusing to move forward,” Rounds said.
Sen. Chris Coons (D-Delaware) grew livid at the suggestion that Democrats are blocking a deal.
“Look, the Trump administration is already shutting the government down,” Coons said.
In recent years, he oversaw funding dedicated to USAID and other foreign aid programs, Coons said. “It has specific and concrete language that says you cannot restructure USAID without congressional approval. They just did it. They just did it. So this is not hypothetical. It is not hyperbole. It is a completely understandable concern.”
The Democrats are demanding an agreement written into the package to require Trump to abide by these spending bill outlines. That is the sort of thing that resides above the pay grade of the House and Senate Appropriations committee leaders.
Those types of “riders,” as they are known by insiders, require negotiations among Thune, Johnson and their Democratic counterparts, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (New York) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (New York), as well as the administration.
But Trump is not paying close attention to insider machinations on Capitol Hill. Johnson and Thune’s spat has gone on for almost three months now, over one or two bills using the fast-track route to pass legislation on party-line votes.
Each time Trump has seemed <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/07/trump-backs-one-big-beautiful-bill-perils-await/"" target=_blank>to force a path</a> — like his social media posts Wednesday morning <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/20/senate-budget-trump-tax-cuts-deportations/479e78ec-efe2-11ef-bd80-8f2ac5c75a8a_story.html"" target=_blank>supporting Johnson’s one “big, beautiful bill”</a> — he contradicts the decision soon after. (Early Wednesday afternoon, Vice President JD Vance met with GOP senators and gave them the green light to continue their two-bill approach.)
Trump has spent more<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/11/17/donald-trump-pga-liv-golf/?utm_campaign=wp_sports&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter"" target=_blank> personal time</a> trying to negotiate a truce to professional golf’s civil war — including <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/20/pga-tour-saudi-pif-trump-white-house/"" target=_blank>a three-hour meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday that included Tiger Woods</a> — than he has dedicated to trying to hammer out a deal to keep the government funded.
Thune devoted the past week to the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/21/senate-budget-border-trump-immigration/"" target=_blank>Senate passage of a budget resolution</a> that is a first step on the way toward increased border and defense spending. If successful that way, Thune would come back later in the year to pass another GOP-only bill including tax cuts.
Johnson is aiming in the coming weeks to pass the House’s budget resolution, trying to wrap all of the GOP’s priorities into one massive bill.
Even if he succeeds, Johnson’s plan would then instruct committees to spend a few months pulling together all the legislation before returning to the House floor to consider the massive package.
None of those actions would do anything to avert<b> </b>the shutdown iceberg that is dead ahead.
All of this could have been handled in December, at the end of Biden’s presidency, as the appropriators had a rough spending outline ready to divide up more than $1.7 trillion in agency budgets.
But Johnson, fearing a revolt from the far-right flank, ordered up a punt on the funding bills until March 14 so that he could secure <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/03/house-speaker-vote-live-updates/"" target=_blank>enough votes on Jan. 3 </a>for another term as speaker.
Murray has not been shy about sending out warning flares that a real deadline is fast approaching.
“I would urge my Republican colleagues to get serious and keep your eye on the ball regarding the funding lapse on March 14,” she said <a href=""https://www.murray.senate.gov/in-senate-budget-committee-republicans-block-murray-amendments-for-bipartisan-approach-to-spending-affirming-congressional-spending-authority-reversing-nih-cuts-transparency-accountability-f/"" target=""_blank"">during a Feb. 12 Senate Budget Committee hearing</a> on Thune’s budget proposal.
Some congressional insiders fear that a prolonged shutdown is something that Musk and the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought — whose roots come from working for the most far-right House Republicans — would cheer on. Musk, an unelected adviser with vast power, has so far not worried about the consequences of mass firings of workers in charge of air safety and those administering crucial foreign aid abroad.
And this shutdown could be much more painful than the nearly five-week version during Trump’s first term that started in late 2018. That shutdown partially shuttered some federal agencies, although critical entities, such as the Pentagon, already had their annual budgets approved and remained open.
This year, a mid-March shutdown would leave every agency without funding, keeping only those employees deemed essential at their posts. Even those key federal workers still at their jobs, such as Border Patrol agents and military troops stationed abroad, would be working without pay.
Collins, who voted to convict Trump in the 2021 impeachment trial, indicated she opposes the Democratic bid to write binding language into the spending bills.
“When bills like this are done, the rule in the past has been no poison pills, no new riders,” she told reporters.
Coons doesn’t even know how Democrats would write such a guarantee into legislation, given that it is already the law.
“I mean, it is demonstrably the law that when we pass an appropriations bill, and the president signs it into law, it has the force of law,” he said. “And you’re supposed to follow it.”",False
Utah could become the first state to ban fluoride in its drinking water,"Utah could become the first state to ban fluoride in its drinking water, alarming <a href=""https://adanews.ada.org/ada-news/2025/february/utah-set-to-ban-community-water-fluoridation/"" target=_blank>public health experts and dentists </a>who note the mineral’s role in reducing tooth decay across the nation.
The Republican-controlled statehouse sent the legislation to Gov. Spencer Cox (R) last week after both chambers passed it largely along party lines. If signed into law, the <a href=""https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0081.html"" target=_blank>bill</a> would prohibit adding fluoride to public water systems and would bar cities and counties from requiring the mineral in their water.
Opponents of the measure <a href=""https://www.uda.org/government-affairs/fluoride"" target=_blank>argue </a>that it infringes on communities’ right to decide whether to use the cavity-fighting mineral and that it<b> </b>departs from decades of science demonstrating fluoride’s enamel-strengthening, tooth-decay-combating benefits — particularly for children. The bill’s supporters <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1A1s1VDW9y/"" target=_blank>contend</a> that it would prevent the government from medicating the public without its consent.
The governor has not publicly indicated whether he supports the bill, and his office did not immediately respond to request for comment on Tuesday. The Republican governor, who occasionally <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/03/23/utah-cox-transgender-athlete-veto/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwY2xjawIrMrVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHZD5IgYgTW1mXm3PPM2X3SeBkNNMqArWGTijzUvNjiZbzxekMCUE2Mmxkg_aem_NA3_iem9lK2GmT-Rb8ocXw"" target=_blank>breaks </a>from party lines, has until the end of March to sign or veto the bill; if he takes no action, it will lapse into law.
Utah’s potentially unprecedented move comes at a time of renewed attention to the practice of adding fluoride to drinking water: <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/14/robert-f-kennedy-jr-hhs-secretary/"" target=_blank>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, the newly appointed Health and Human Services secretary, has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/03/rfk-jr-trump-fluoride-water/"" target=_blank>assailed </a>the practice, alleging that it can harm brain development and bones.
While this isn’t the first time communities have fought over fluoride, which was first used in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the issue has historically been hyperlocal, rather than partisan. Democrat-majority<b> </b>states, such as <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/20/rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-oregon/"" target=""_blank"">Oregon </a>and New Jersey, have some of the lowest fluoridation rates, while states where Republicans predominate, including Kentucky and South Carolina, boast some of the highest.
Most Americans drink fluoridated water, including about <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2024/fluoride-water-mandates/"" target=_blank>half of Utah residents</a>. The process of adjusting fluoride quantities to recommended levels — known as community water fluoridation — reduces oral health disparities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most communities that add the mineral do so voluntarily, but about a dozen states require fluoridation. Some of those mandates have been in place for more than 50 years.
In Utah, residents who receive fluoridated water — in Salt Lake County, Davis County and Brigham City — experience tooth decay at rates 25 to 50 percent lower than other residents, according to the Utah Dental Association. The group blasted the bill, urging residents to call Cox’s office to demand a veto.
“House Bill 81 would adopt public policy that is in complete opposition to effectively decreasing dental decay and strengthening teeth enamel,” <a href=""https://www.uda.org/government-affairs/call-to-governor-cox-to-veto-hb-81"" target=_blank>the group said</a>.
The group’s national counterpart, the American Dental Association, sent a letter to Cox on Tuesday to similarly urge a veto.
“Utah would be the only state to end this preventive health practice that has been in place for over three quarters of a century,” the group <a href=""https://www.ada.org/-/media/Project/ADA%20Organization/ADA/ADA-org/Files/Advocacy/Prevention%20and%20Education/utah_cwf_bill_veto_letter_20250225.pdf"" target=_blank>wrote</a>. “The Utah measure proposes to take the unprecedented step of ending one of the most trusted and tested public health strategies in the arsenal of preventive medicine.”
Utah Rep. Stephanie Gricius (R), the bill’s sponsor, said the legislation is about choice.
“Community water fluoridation does not allow for informed consent which is a crucial component of good, healthcare policy,” she wrote in an email to The Washington Post, adding that she is “hopeful” that Cox will sign the bill, “given the broad support from both legislative bodies.”
Days before the presidential election, Kennedy signaled that a<b> </b>future Trump administration <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/03/rfk-jr-trump-fluoride-water/"" target=""_blank"">would advise</a> water districts to remove fluoride, which he <a href=""https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923"" target=""_blank"">referred to</a> as “an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease.” Medical organizations said Kennedy’s assertions are unfounded; Trump <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-banning-vaccines-president-rfk-fluoride-rcna178570"" target=""_blank"">supported</a> the idea.

"D.C. crash took place in congested airspace shared by jets, helicopters","The airspace along the Potomac River where an <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/30/dc-plane-crash-updates-helicopter-potomac-reagan-airport/"" target=_blank>Army helicopter and an airliner crashed</a> Wednesday night poses some of the most complex challenges in the country for pilots, requiring them to rely on layers of procedures and electronic safeguards to avoid a catastrophe.
Military and Coast Guard helicopters frequently fly low over the river, sharing the skies with planes on the heavily used takeoff and landing routes for Washington’s Reagan National Airport. Congestion in the skies and on runways and taxiways around the airport has raised safety concerns for years. National was built to handle 15 million passengers annually; it now handles 25 million.
Dennis Tajer, an American Airlines captain, said that means pilots have to be at their best when flying into the airport.
“It’s a beehive of activity,” said Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, American’s pilot union. “It’s extremely compact, and it’s a high volume of traffic.”

Somehow, the many safeguards failed Wednesday when the Black Hawk helicopter on a training mission and the American Airlines flight from Wichita collided hundreds of feet above the river as the commercial plane approached its runway for landing.
No survivors were found from among the 64 people on the plane and three service members aboard the helicopter, authorities said.<b> </b>Experts said the initial accounts of the crash are likely to raise questions about the heavily trafficked airspace, communications between the two aircraft and air traffic controllers and whether industry and government responses to near collisions on runways across the country were sufficient.

“We know the system has been under duress,” said Tajer, who does not represent pilots at American subsidiary PSA Airlines, which was involved in the crash.
There are designated routes for helicopters flying around the Washington region that tend to follow the area’s<b> </b>rivers. It appeared that the helicopter that collided with the airliner Wednesday was in or near one of those routes along the eastern bank of the Potomac, according to Scott Dunham, a retired National Transportation Safety Board investigator. Air traffic controllers also help manage traffic and were in contact with the helicopter, according to audio recordings archived by <a href=""http://liveatc.net/"" target=_blank>LiveATC.net</a>.

“It’s a corridor where helicopters are allowed to fly at a low level,” said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration investigator. How the routes and altitudes of both aircraft intersected in the moments before the collision will be closely scrutinized.
As another layer of protection against midair collisions, airliners are equipped with the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, which issues automated verbal alerts to pilots to avoid an imminent crash. Experts said it will be up to investigators to determine whether the pilots received any warnings from the system, whether the military aircraft was detected by the system or whether it was providing alerts at such a low altitude with many other aircraft around.
As planes approach the ground, the system gradually limits the number of alerts it provides to avoid distracting pilots, according to retired United Airlines pilot Ross Aimer.
The crash occurred in one of the most sensitive air corridors in the country, many of whose operations are classified because of security considerations given the proximity to the White House, Capitol, Pentagon and numerous other civilian and military facilities. The region is home to three major airports, 11 regional airports and 55 heliports, not including those operated by the military.

According to a 2021 <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/gao-report-on-helicopter-noise-in-the-d-c-region/d13a6d80-2eef-4a34-a4fe-a42705ce134e/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18"" target=_blank>report to Congress,</a> 50 entities operated roughly 88,000 helicopter flights between 2017 and 2019, based on FAA data. Most were tied to the military, but others included flights by medical operations, state and local law enforcement, and federal agencies.
Lawmakers<b> </b>proposed in 2023 to add more flights at National to serve new long-distance routes. Opponents of the idea raised questions about safety.
Last year, as part of legislation to fund the FAA, Congress added five round-trip flights. The decision came over the objections of members of the D.C.-area congressional delegation, who have long argued that the airport is at capacity.
U.S. airlines have had a strong safety record in recent years, with the last mass-fatality crash occurring in 2009. Federal aviation officials have scrambled to respond to a spate of near collisions at airports around the country that began in 2023. Industry leaders said they were a warning sign that there was risk of a crash as air traffic bounced back from pandemic-era lows.
The FAA has investigated at least three close calls at National in recent years. Two occurred in quick succession last year, heightening concerns. In one, air traffic controllers instructed a Southwest jet to cross a runway while a JetBlue plane was starting its takeoff roll down the same runway. In a second incident, an American Airlines jet preparing for takeoff nearly collided with a King Air plane that was landing on a shorter runway nearby. The FAA was investigating both incidents.

Democratic AGs score early wins against Trump’s birthright citizenship ban,"Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, the son of Chinese immigrants, <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/-first-sue-opposing-trumps-desire-end-birthright-citizenship-personal-rcna184891"" target=""_blank"">laid down a marker</a> when asked in December about Donald Trump’s pledge to end birthright citizenship: “I would be the first to sue.”
Three weeks later, he was the first — but he was not standing alone.
Behind the scenes, Tong and fellow Democratic attorneys general from 21 states and D.C. had signed a confidential “common interest agreement” to share information, collaborate on legal briefs and join forces on litigation to fight Trump on a potential U.S. citizenship ban. Their arrangement took effect Nov. 14, just nine days after the presidential election, according to a copy of the document obtained by The Washington Post.
That early partnership and planning has paid off. At a time when congressional Democrats have appeared politically flat-footed in response to the shock-and-awe tactics of Trump’s first month in the White House, this group of attorneys general has responded with a legal fire wall on a case that has become one of the first clear examples of a coordinated resistance to the administration’s extraordinary efforts to expand presidential power and challenge constitutional limits.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit recently <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/20/trump-birthright-citizenship-appeal-case/"" target=_blank>upheld a Seattle judge’s nationwide injunction</a> on Trump’s birthright citizenship order in one of the two cases brought by the Democratic states. Judges in both of those cases, and two others brought by civil rights groups, have issued injunctions. Legal experts said the issue could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
“We did not wake up the day after the election and say, ‘Oh, no, what are we going to do now?’” Tong said in a recent interview. “Nobody was taking any chances, so, sure, we were talking about the possibility that Trump would win, and he telegraphed all the things he wanted to do during the campaign. What I said to people after he was elected is that, as a minimum response, we should take him at his word that he will do everything that he said he was going to do. And so he has.”
The legal challenge to Trump’s attempted ban is part of a broader effort by Democratic attorneys general, who have now teamed up on eight multistate lawsuits against Trump’s actions and scored some <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/trump-lawsuits-executive-orders-actions-legal-challenges/"" target=_blank>key early wins in federal court</a>. They say they are prepared for a long, sustained legal fight, one informed by lessons learned during Trump’s first administration, in which the Democratic states were slower to act collectively.
Most legal scholars say the citizenship clause of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment grants birthright citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil other than the children of foreign diplomats. Trump’s order, which seeks to ban it for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreigners in the country on temporary visas, could affect more than 150,000 newborns annually, according to some independent studies.
Starting early last year, the attorneys general say, their offices began to communicate about how to establish a legal bulwark against Trump’s campaign promises to take unprecedented executive actions. Birthright citizenship, which Trump discussed frequently on the campaign trail, emerged as a likely early target and an issue on which the Democratic attorneys general believed they were on firm legal footing.
Legal scholars have overwhelmingly called the matter settled law, pointing to an 1898 Supreme Court ruling that Wong Kim Ark, the San Francisco-born son of Chinese immigrants who was denied reentry to the country, was a U.S. citizen.
The attorneys general also examined the road map laid out in Project 2025, a blueprint for expanding presidential authority published by the conservative Heritage Foundation.
Their preparation was evident after Trump, on his first day in office, <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/"" target=""_blank"">signed an executive order</a> seeking to curb automatic citizenship.
The next day, all 22 Democratic states, along with D.C. and the city of San Francisco, challenged the order as unconstitutional in a pair of federal lawsuits — a 32-page filing in Seattle and a 50-page filing in Boston. Judges in both cases have issued nationwide injunctions against Trump’s order, with the Seattle judge calling it <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/06/trump-birthright-citizenship/"" target=_blank>“blatantly unconstitutional.”</a>
“We drafted the bulk of the lawsuit before the president signed his order at 8 o’clock at night. When he signed it, we were ready to go, and we filed the next morning,” said New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, who along with Tong and Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell took the lead in the Boston case. “It was a function of the work and collaboration we had done over the better part of a year.”
Washington state, which led the challenge to Trump’s travel ban for immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries during his first term, took the lead on the Seattle filing on the birthright lawsuit last month. The state’s attorney general, Nick Brown, said his office had done a significant amount of work on the issue and shared it with colleagues in other offices. Oregon, Illinois and Arizona joined Washington in filing that case.
“We had both substantive expertise and interest in doing that, and our office communicated early on that we wanted to take a leadership role,” Brown said. He noted that his office, with more than 800 attorneys, is one of the largest in the nation. “We felt like we had a good case to make here.”
Their strategy to confront Trump on birthright citizenship and other issues reflects an accelerating pattern of multistate challenges against the federal government brought largely along party lines, said Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University, who <a href=""https://attorneysgeneral.org/multistate-lawsuits-vs-the-federal-government/list-of-lawsuits-1980-present/"" target=_blank>maintains a database</a> to track such cases.
He identified 76 multistate lawsuits during President George W. Bush’s eight years in office and 80 in President Barack Obama’s two terms. The numbers skyrocketed to 160 cases during Trump’s first term and 133 in President Joe Biden’s four-year tenure.
“AGs are suing over just about everything — every major policy, every regulation, every attempt to reverse a previous administration,” Nolette said. He added that the increasingly prominent role of judges, in lieu of Congress, in establishing federal policy is unhealthy for a democratic system.
Trump’s allies argue that birthright citizenship offers an incentive for immigrants to try to enter the United States illegally and helps them fight deportation once they give birth here. While 89 percent of the public supports deporting undocumented immigrants with violent criminal records, just 30 percent are in favor of removing parents whose children are U.S. citizens, according to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2025/02/19/feb-13-18-2025-washington-post-ipsos-poll/"" target=_blank>a recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll</a>.
Mike Howell, executive director of the Heritage Foundation’s Oversight Project, said the intensive focus of the Democratic attorneys general on the birthright citizenship issue demonstrated what he called their “nakedly political” interests around immigration. He suggested Democrats are interested in maintaining a core voting constituency by ensuring more immigrants gain citizenship, a theory for which there is no evidence.
Independent polling has found that illegal immigration to the United States is driven by migrants seeking better economic opportunity and freedom from political persecution in their home countries.
“It is not surprising to see they have such an agreement,” Howell said, referring to the legal agreement the attorneys general signed in November. “What this document does is confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt the priority of this — a major muscle movement to get this many states on one document together.”
Tong scoffed at the notion that the coordinated effort aimed to consolidate the votes of immigrant communities. “This was a direct attack on people, on babies, on children, on families in Connecticut,” he said. “People viscerally understand that. This was not a hard one for me.”
Civil rights groups also have filed six lawsuits challenging the birthright citizenship order. Advocates said they try to coordinate with the states, which have much larger staffs and can bring broader claims of potential harm.
The civil rights groups are representing pregnant individuals whose children would be denied citizenship, while the states have argued that they would lose federal revenue to help provide public benefits for the children and be tasked with new administrative burdens to help enforce Trump’s order.
The states also are getting support from blue cities, including San Francisco, where City Attorney David Chiu said his support of the states’ birthright citizenship lawsuit is based in part on the city’s history in the Wong Kim Ark case.
“Our office wants to make sure the story … is told accurately and litigated fully,” said Chiu, who is in touch with Wong’s descendants. The family, he said, is “horrified at the idea that the 14th Amendment and that case could be summarily ignored by the president of the United States.”",False

Purdue Pharma owners strike new $6.5 billion deal in opioid case,"The billionaire family that owns Purdue Pharma, maker of the pain medication blamed for helping fuel the nation’s opioid crisis, has agreed to increase payments to settle long-running litigation against the company, promising to pay $6.5 billion over 15 years as part of a deal announced Thursday by several state attorneys general.
The deal comes after the Supreme Court in June blocked a controversial bankruptcy plan for Purdue that shielded Sackler family members — who themselves did not file for bankruptcy — from future opioid lawsuits in exchange for paying up to $6 billion over 18 years.
The new deal, if approved by a New York federal bankruptcy judge and state courts, will allow governments and victims who don’t agree to the settlement to pursue lawsuits against the Sacklers. The agreement also calls for setting aside an initial $200 million — and up to $800 million — to use toward defending the Sacklers against those future claims, according to the offices of the New York and Connecticut attorneys general; money not used after five years would begin to revert to states.
“I have said since Day 1 that this fight has been about justice and accountability for the hundreds of thousands of victims and families wrecked by the opioid epidemic,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong <a href=""https://portal.ct.gov/ag/press-releases/2025-press-releases/purdue-pharma-and-sackler-family-settlement-in-principle"" target=_blank>said</a> in a statement. “There will never be enough justice or dollars to restore those families or right this terrible wrong.”
The total deal is worth $7.4 billion, with Purdue contributing nearly $900 million to pay governments and victims. If approved, a significant portion of the money will be paid within three years, state officials said.
The company, in a statement, said the new agreement will deliver billions of dollars to “compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver treatment and overdose rescue medicines that will save lives.” Representatives from multiple branches of the Sackler family did not reply to requests for comment.
The announcement adds another chapter to the winding legal saga involving the pharmaceutical company that earned billions of dollars from the blockbuster painkiller OxyContin as sales representatives in the late 1990s and early 2000s aggressively marketed the drug while downplaying the risk of addiction. Purdue, facing a tsunami of lawsuits from governments, tribes, hospitals, opioid victims and others, filed for bankruptcy in 2019, pausing legal claims against the company.
Sackler family members have denied wrongdoing or personal responsibility, although two branches of the family in <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/03/10/opioid-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-sackler/"" target=_blank>an earlier statement</a> to a bankruptcy court expressed regret that “OxyContin, a prescription medicine that continues to help people suffering from chronic pain, unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis that has brought grief and loss to far too many families and communities.”
Lawsuits against Purdue and the Sacklers have loomed as part of wider litigation against pharmaceutical companies, drug distributors, pharmacy retail chains, pharmacy benefit managers and others accused of helping fuel the nation’s opioid crisis. Governments have alleged that the distributors and pharmacies failed to flag suspicious orders of prescription opioids, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/10/opioids-ohio-supreme-court-cvs-walgreens-walmart/"" target=_blank>stretching thin</a> the public safety and health resources of communities hard hit by addiction.
Companies have agreed to about $50 billion in settlements — money intended to help communities ease the effects of the epidemic by paying for overdose reversal medications, addiction treatment, education, police resources and other uses.
Purdue’s initial bankruptcy plan proved controversial, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/12/03/purdue-pharma-supreme-court-bankruptcy-settlement/"" target=_blank>dividing families</a> who have lost relatives to addiction and drug overdoses. Supporters insisted that the deal would provide much-needed money to communities to address the epidemic. They pointed out that nearly all the creditors who voted on the plan approved of the deal.
Critics asserted the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/10/14/sackler-family-opioids-legal-strategy-lawsuits/"" target=_blank>Sacklers</a>, who withdrew $11 billion from the company in the years leading up to the bankruptcy, were not paying enough and would avoid civil trials. The family has long said the withdrawals were lawful and nearly half was paid to taxes.
The Justice Department objected, saying bankruptcy law did not allow the Sacklers to get shielded from lawsuits from future parties who did not consent. A divided<b> </b>Supreme Court in June <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/27/purdue-pharma-supreme-court-opioid-bankruptcy/"" target=_blank>ruled</a> in the Justice Department’s favor.
The new deal hashed out through court-ordered mediation mirrors the previous plan in key ways. The family would relinquish control of Purdue, which would be refashioned into a company whose earnings would go toward curbing the opioid epidemic. Millions of internal Purdue documents chronicling the company’s role in the opioid crisis would be made public.
The settlement “represents justice for the untold victims who suffered because the Sacklers put profits above people,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
The new settlement will also pay between $800 million and $850 million in total compensation to opioid victims, a boost from the previous figure, which allowed for payments of up to $750 million.
“The new settlement is an improvement over the old one, but for those who say this is a vindication of the government’s senseless appeals … the hundreds of victims who lost their lives because of the delay, would beg to differ,” said Edward Neiger, an attorney who represents a committee made up of thousands of victims.

More than a dozen states — including California, Florida, New York and Virginia — participated in the talks and must now seek participation from other states and local governments who have sued. Some governments may roll the dice at trial. For instance, Nassau County, New York, has “made it clear the Sacklers will be in a courtroom in New York regardless of this new effort to derail a jury trial,” said attorney Hunter Shkolnik, who represents the county.
Relatives of some opioid victims also criticized the deal.
Since 2000, hundreds of thousands have died in the United States of prescription opioid overdoses, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The crisis recently has evolved into an even deadlier phase, marked by the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl that typically are illegally manufactured and imported.
Ed Bisch, who lost his son to an overdose and runs a group called Relatives Against Purdue Pharma, said victims “paid with their lives and get peanuts in the end — while states collect billions in blood money.”",False

"Men may be more romantic than women, experts say","The question:
Is it true that men are more romantic than women?
The science:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miHn0n4sAz4"" target=_blank>Hollywood</a> has<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRw2d7hRR9o"" target=_blank> made</a> men the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SixsaGWC2Io"" target=_blank>embodiment</a> of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyrP-pwDayE"" target=_blank>romance</a> in heterosexual <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEWaqUVac3M"" target=_blank>relationships</a>. But whether men are more romantic in real life may depend on how you define romanticism, as well as the cultural, societal and other expectations that may influence romantic behaviors, some experts said.
In American culture, there is often an expectation that men plan and pay for the date, buy the flowers and pull out the chair, said <a href=""https://kinseyinstitute.org/about/profiles/jgarcia.php"">Justin Garcia</a>, executive director of the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University.
“Even as we’ve seen more gender egalitarian tendencies in dating,” he added, there are “still a lot of gender norms around that. It makes it, in many ways, appear like men do more romantic things because they’re expected to.”
Expectations aside, “I think men are more romantic than they’re often given credit for,” said Garcia, an evolutionary biologist and sex researcher.
Research has not suggested that men may be more romantic than women across the board. But in <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407589064001"">a 1989 study</a> that developed the romantic beliefs scale, which is widely used in research to measure how strongly someone agrees or disagrees with romantic ideas such as love at first sight, researchers noted that, generally, men were more likely than women to endorse the ideology of romanticism and hold romantic beliefs.
Other research suggests that men have a tendency to <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/romantic-relationships-matter-more-to-men-than-to-women/52E626D3CD7DB14CD946F9A2FBDA739C"">strive harder to establish romantic relationships</a> and benefit more from them, to be the first to <a href=""https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0022412"">say “I love you”</a> and to <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/romantic-relationships-matter-more-to-men-than-to-women/52E626D3CD7DB14CD946F9A2FBDA739C"">suffer more</a> from love lost. Many studies are limited in that they are self-reported surveys, represent smaller subsets of the overall population and often focus on heterosexual relationships.
In <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/romantic-relationships-matter-more-to-men-than-to-women/52E626D3CD7DB14CD946F9A2FBDA739C"">examining</a> numerous psychological and sociological studies on gender differences in relationships, researchers noted last year that one possible explanation may be that men tend to rely more on their significant others for emotional support and are less likely to seek it outside of their romantic relationships.
A 2021 <a href=""https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/"">survey</a> reported that men are significantly less likely than women to share their personal feelings or receive emotional support from a friend.
Despite the research suggesting that men tend to hold more romantic ideals, women are often perceived in society as more romantic, said Gwendolyn Seidman, a visiting scholar in the department of psychology at Michigan State University. Seidman said this may be because women tend to view themselves as <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laura-Madson/publication/14014155_Models_of_the_self_Self-construals_and_gender/links/02bfe513dfaae80869000000/Models-of-the-self-Self-construals-and-gender.pdf"">being connected to their romantic partners</a>, crave more <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407599165002"">closeness and connection</a> in romantic relationships, and put more effort into maintenance — thinking about the relationship, seeking social support and initiating discussions about the relationship, <a href=""https://interpersona.psychopen.eu/index.php/interpersona/article/view/3467"">one study suggested</a>.
Technically, “that’s different from being romantic,” Seidman said.
In relationship<b> </b>research, romanticism refers to general beliefs about love, rather than actions taken within romantic relationships, Seidman said. “Believing in love at first sight or that we all have only one true love doesn’t relate to how much effort you put into your actual relationship day in and day out,” she said.
While there are notable differences in how men and women think about, approach and engage in romantic relationships, it is important to remember that romanticism may mean different things to different couples, some experts said.
What matters is that both men and women tend to want the same things out of their relationships, said <a href=""https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/paul-eastwick"">Paul Eastwick</a>, a professor of psychology at the University of California at<b> </b>Davis.
“The same things that make men happy are going to be the same things that make women happy — having somebody who has your back, somebody you can go to when you’ve had successes, be with you when times are hard, somebody who’s exciting and makes you laugh,” he said. “There is not a shred of evidence that men and women differ in the extent to which they care about those things.”

“With finals looming last semester, seasonal depression slowly started to get to me, and anyone who came into my dorm room could tell. Clothes piled high on the floor, and the pile on my twin sized bed often toppled into its companion pile. I did not have the motivation to do anything about it. But I came back one day to a clean room. My boyfriend had texted my roommate who let him in. He folded my clothes and hung my pants up on hangers in my wardrobe. It truly is the small things.” <i>— Zachary Clifton, 19, Connecticut</i>
“In fourth grade, a quiet, slender, blond little boy moved from California to our small Arkansas town. When Valentine’s rolled around that first year he was there, among the store-bought cards I received was a red homemade Valentine. It opened to reveal a hand-drawn and colored Queen of Hearts playing card. Across the Valentine was written, ‘You are the Queen of Hearts in my life.’ It was from that adorable new boy, Jonathan. I was overwhelmed and showed the Valentine to my family. I wanted so badly to tell him that I had a huge crush on him, too, but I was too bashful. I never said a word about it or how I loved it to him. We both graduated, went to separate colleges and married other people. I kept Jonathan’s Valentine well into my 30s. Jump to my 25-year class reunion: I was divorced, and Jonathan showed up, in the midst of a divorce. We had not seen each other since graduation night. The first thing I asked him was, ‘Do you remember that Valentine you gave me in fourth grade?’ He did. We got married two years later and have been married for 11 years now. He is my forever Valentine.” <i>— Mary Katherine Foy, 56, Texas</i>

Trump plans emerge to use U.S. military bases for immigrant detention,"A Space Force military base in Colorado will serve as a detention center for immigrant detainees facing deportation, Defense Department officials said Wednesday.
In a statement, military officials said facilities would be provided at Buckley Space Force Base for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to stage and process criminal aliens.” The site will be operated by ICE officials and other federal law enforcement agencies, not the U.S. military, according to U.S. Northern Command. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L.

ICE has the capacity to hold about 40,000 detainees nationwide  in private jails and county facilities where the agency rents beds. Those facilities are nearly full, ICE officials say, and the agency has taken thousands of detainees into custody since Trump took office last week and launched a mass deportation campaign.

"Trump signs executive order to create crypto council, reduce regulation","President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that aims to ease regulation on cryptocurrency, seeking to fulfill the policy promises he made to the industry after courting its cash and support throughout the 2024 campaign.

Trump proposes permanent displacement of Gazans as he welcomes Netanyahu to White House,"President <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/"" target=_blank>Donald Trump</a> on Tuesday proposed moving Gazans to a “good, fresh, beautiful piece of land” in another country, offering a vision of mass displacement that would likely inflame sentiments in the Arab world as he prepared to welcome <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/03/netanyahu-trump-white-house-gaza/"" target=_blank>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House</a>.
Trump framed the vision as a practical response to the physical destruction of Gaza after 16 months of intense bombardment from Israel. But given the decades-long history of the displacement of Palestinians in the region, as well as vows by the Israeli far-right to claim the Gaza Strip for themselves, Trump’s proposal was likely to provoke a furious reaction from many Palestinians as well as their Arab allies in the region, since it suggested permanently removing Gaza’s 2.2 million residents from Palestinian territory and settling them somewhere else.

Judge orders Trump administration to pay millions in USAID funds,"A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to pay hundreds of millions in foreign assistance funds that have been in limbo despite his previous directive that such aid resume — action targeting President Donald Trump’s broad pause in aid, which has led to chaos globally and dire warnings about escalating famine.
U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali gave the government until 11:59 p.m. Wednesday to fulfill its contractual obligations and restart payments to contractors whose work in impoverished parts of the world had been largely stopped during an <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/21/usaid-trump-freeze-food-foreign-aid/"">ongoing legal battle</a>. Administration officials must also provide examples of communication sent to partners on the ground about resuming assistance, Ali ruled.
His order applies to work done before Feb. 13.
Aid groups that are plaintiffs in the case provided evidence that the government has not lifted its suspension of funding, Ali said, and the defendants did not rebut that Tuesday.
The administration filed a notice of appeal late Tuesday afternoon. A spokesman has said officials will not discuss the pending litigation outside of court.
During the contentious 90-minute hearing, Justice Department lawyer Indraneel Sur told Ali he was “not in a position to answer” whether the Trump administration had taken needed steps to allow the assistance to begin moving. Sur said the administration would provide further details in a status report due at noon Wednesday.
“I don’t know why I can’t get a straight answer from you,” Ali responded. “We are now 12 days in. You can’t answer me whether any of the funds … covered by the court’s order have been unfrozen?”
The total amount owed to organizations by the U.S. Agency for International Development was not immediately clear, but one development group, DAI Global LLC, said in court filings that it is owed more than $115 million. Separately, the U.N. World Food Program — the largest distributor of food aid — is owed more than $820 million, officials confirmed this week.
More than 10 days of delays have wreaked havoc on some of the world’s poorest and sickest communities. People with HIV have lost access to lifesaving medicines. Those in famine-stricken areas of Sudan and other countries <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/"">are without food</a>.
In an emergency request Monday, the partner organizations said they face possible eviction and threats to worker safety because of the administration’s ongoing defiance of Ali’s federal court order.
“What the government has revealed is that the government has done nothing to make the flow of payments happen,” Stephen K. Wirth, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, said in court.
The groups allege that instead of complying with Ali’s directive, the Trump administration “chose to take a series of new actions” around access to a key reimbursement system, adding new approval processes and terminating “hundreds of critical personnel” — “all but halting the disbursement of foreign-assistance funds,” according to their emergency motion.
Despite the State Department <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/28/state-department-foreign-aid-trump-waiver/"">granting a waiver</a> for certain lifesaving aid to resume, the plaintiffs contend, the payment system remains down, with employees seeing a variety of error messages when they try to submit invoices. Many organizations have not been paid for expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2024, before Trump returned to the White House.
Should the government not comply by Ali’s new deadline, “we are in uncharted and dangerous territory,” Lauren Bateman, another attorney for the plaintiffs, noted via email after Tuesday’s hearing.
The case is among several in which legal experts say the administration has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/20/trump-judge-orders-comply-defy-usaid/"">come close</a> to the red line of disobeying judicial orders as Trump and his allies assert vast<b> </b>presidential powers.
Thousands of federal workers have lost their jobs in recent weeks, adding to the chaos. On Sunday, the administration sent notices that it would <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/"">eliminate</a><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/""><b> </b></a><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/"">1,600 jobs at USAID</a> and place all but a small number of the remaining employees on leave, after a different federal judge ruled that the job-cutting efforts could move forward.
Aid advocates believe the Trump administration is determined to dismantle USAID, the chief U.S. agency for foreign assistance, which provides $40 billion in help each year. The president and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have both derided the diplomats’ work, with Trump calling them “radical lunatics” and Musk vowing USAID must “die.”

"With one last stop, Bullis is too much and makes it three straight IAC titles","Adrien Stevens watched the frenzy unfold from his backside.
After tumbling to the court while fighting for a rebound on the final play of the Interstate Athletic Conference championship game, the Marquette-bound conference player of the year remained seated as Bullis students stormed from the bleachers to meet the Bulldogs at midcourt. When Stevens got to his feet, he avoided the scrum as he walked to the scorers’ table to join a developing handshake line.
When he arrived, he had just one question: “Where’s that trophy at?”
Saturday’s 55-53 win over Georgetown Prep in Potomac required every ounce of effort Stevens and his Bullis teammates could muster. They were pushed by the talented Little Hoyas (14-13) for the full 32 minutes, but the result granted the Bulldogs (20-7) a continuation of their recent dominance: For the third consecutive season, they claimed the IAC regular season and tournament titles.
“It’s really special to be a part of something like this,” said Stevens, a senior guard who led his team with 16 points. “Bullis has changed my life, so I’m just glad I could be a part of putting three banners up on the wall.”
After trailing 14-3 behind early sharpshooting from Georgetown Prep senior guard Patrick McDonough, the game’s top scorer with 17 points, Bullis had to regroup. The Bulldogs played a rigorous nonconference schedule, at times taking their lumps in the name of preparing for these moments. They contended with injuries and roster turnover, relying on new leaders to prosper and younger pieces to blossom. Each time, the Bulldogs answered the call. A 14-4 run to end the first quarter was Saturday’s answer.
“There are times when being a high school basketball coach is the best job in America, and knowing what these boys have been through, just staying together and trusting me, it’s just a great feeling,” Bullis’s Bruce Kelley said.
From the second quarter on, the game felt destined to come down to the final shot — and it did. Georgetown Prep had possession with eight seconds left, trailing by two. The ball worked its way to five feet beyond the top of the key. The final seconds were ticking off the clock, and the Hoyas’ attempt was on the way to the rim. Kelley could have sworn it was going in.
But the shot bounced off the iron, and the game was over. Queen’s “We Are the Champions” soon blared from the gym’s speakers. The Bulldogs wouldn’t dare tempt the basketball gods by practicing the ritual beforehand, meaning they finally could climb a stepladder to cut down the nets.
“That was the greatest feeling I’ve ever had,” freshman Xavier Skipworth said. “Coach always says we have to be a fist and not separate fingers. We knew they were going to punch hard, but we just had to stick together. We just did that.”",False

Trump says he wants to send ‘repeat offenders’ in U.S. legally to foreign countries,"DORAL, Fla. — President Donald Trump said Monday that he doesn’t just want to deport undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions, but also hopes to remove violent, repeat offenders — in the United States legally — from the country.
“I don’t want these violent repeat offenders in our country any more than I want illegal aliens from other countries who misbehave,” Trump said at House Republicans’ retreat at his Doral golf club. “And I say — and this is subject to getting it approved — but if they’ve been arrested many, many times, they’re repeat offenders by many numbers, I want them out of our country.
“I also will be seeking permission to do so,” Trump continued, musing: “Let them be brought to a foreign land and maintained by others for a very small fee.” He complained about the cost of keeping inmates in the United States.

"Six girls, 11 to 14, arrested in assault outside Union Station","A total of six girls, ages 11 to 14, have been arrested and charged in an “egregious” and apparently random attack on a woman by a group of youths outside Union Station, according to the D.C. police.
Two of the girls, ages 11 and 13, were arrested Thursday, the police said. The other four girls were arrested Friday, according to police. Their ages were similar to the first two: they were given as 11, 12, 13 and 14.
The first indication of a possible motive in the attack was given Friday. It may have been motivated by prejudice, the police said in a statement Friday night.
“Detectives’ investigation revealed the suspects potentially being motivated by hate or bias,” the statement said.
As a result, police said, all six suspects have been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon with an enhancement related to an alleged hate crime.
The type of prejudice was not specified. An earlier statement, reporting the first two arrests, said nothing about possible hate or bias or any other motive.
Authorities said one of the participants recorded and posted the assault on social media. One of the youths repeatedly kicked and punched the woman, dragged her by the hair “and encouraged the other suspects to continue their attack,” according to a police statement and a report.
No serious injuries were reported, police said Friday.
The incident occurred Sunday but was not reported to police, who said they learned of it Wednesday when they were alerted to videos on the internet. Police have said they were looking for as many as nine girls in the attack.
“The actions of these young suspects are disturbing and deeply disheartening for all of us who care for the youngest people in our community,” D.C Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said in a statement after the first two arrests. “There is absolutely zero tolerance for this behavior in our city. Harming our community like this will result in your arrest and prosecution, no matter your age.”
The attack in Northeast Washington is reminiscent of the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/03/reggie-brown-teen-girls-sentenced-beating-fatal/"" target=""_blank"">deadly assault</a> in 2023 by five girls ages 12 to 14 on Reginald “Reggie” Brown, a frail and disabled 64-year-old man who had been on a stroll that his family said he took to cope with the strain of cancer treatments. One of the girls recorded the beating, and another testified in court that she and her friends had been “bored” and were looking for someone to beat up. All were found criminally responsible in juvenile court and sent to the city’s youth rehabilitation agency.
That incident shocked authorities for its brutality and for the ages of its attackers. It occurred during a year in which violent crime soared in the District and when youths, as both victims and offenders, were of high concern.
In the attack outside Union Station on Massachusetts Avenue, the assailants assaulted bystanders who tried to intervene, police said. They said the first two girls were charged as juveniles with assault with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to riot, simple assault and disorderly conduct.
In addition to the assault charge, those located and arrested Friday were also charged with rioting, the police statement said.
In their original statement, police also said they were collaborating with counterparts in other jurisdictions to determine whether the youths could be connected to similar attacks elsewhere. Those other areas were not identified.",False
Federal board halts firings of six probationary employees amid Trump cuts,"An independent federal board on Tuesday <a href=""https://democracyforward.org/updates/breaking-merit-systems-protection-board-stays-termination-of-six-probationary-federal-workers/"" target=""_blank"">granted a request</a> from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) to halt the termination of six probationary government employees amid the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the federal workforce.
The move by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) was in response to a recent request issued by OSC head Hampton Dellinger, in which the watchdog agency argued that the firings were probably illegal and recommended that they be halted pending an investigation, The Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/24/hampton-dellinger-special-counsel-filing-probationary-employees/"" target=""_blank"">reported</a>.
The MSPB, which hears appeals of disciplinary actions against federal employees, said Tuesday that the request for a 45-day stay of the terminations was appropriate “while OSC further investigates their complaints.”
Legal organization Democracy Forward, which filed a complaint on behalf of the six workers Feb. 14 alongside the Alden Law Group, said Tuesday in a statement that the two groups will now work “to expand the stay to cover all probationary federal employees who were unlawfully terminated.”
Democracy Forward president and CEO Skye Perryman called MSPB’s decision “the correct result of a clearly unlawful and massively disruptive action by the Trump administration.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision.
The MSPB’s move could have wider implications for the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/20/fork-resignation-fired-anyway-trump-federal-workers/"" target=_blank>thousands of probationary employees fired</a> in recent weeks as the Elon Musk-led U.S. DOGE Service <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/24/doge-fast-cuts-federal-workers-programs-elon-musk/"" target=_blank>sweeps through federal agencies</a>.

Dellinger is “considering ways to seek relief for a broader group,” OSC said in a <a href=""https://osc.gov/News/Pages/25-22-Stay-Request-Probationary-Employees.aspx"" target=_blank>statement</a> Monday, while worker advocates hope an investigation could end with a remedy for all fired federal workers.
OSC, which investigates whistleblower reports filed by government workers, is tasked with investigating and prosecuting complaints about prohibited personnel practices in the federal workforce, such as retaliation or rule-breaking, that violate the merit system.
President Donald Trump has tried to oust <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/16/trump-supreme-court-executive-power/"" target=_blank>Dellinger</a> and MSPB chair <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/18/merit-systems-protection-board-cathy-harris-restored-trump-ouster/"" target=_blank>Cathy Harris</a> as he looks to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/13/trump-firings-watchdogs/"" target=_blank>remake and seize greater control</a> of the federal bureaucracy. Both have sued the Trump administration over their firings, saying their terminations violate federal law, and have been temporarily reinstated by district judges in D.C.
In the Feb. 14 complaint, the six workers allege they were fired during “plainly unlawful” mass terminations that were “indisputably conducted with no regard for the performance or conduct of individual probationary employees.”
The six employees were terminated around the same time as at least 5,000 or more other probationary workers in their agencies, according to estimates cited in Dellinger’s request. They worked for the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, as well as the Office of Personnel Management.
Dellinger found that the employees had not been given notice of any specific issues with their job performance or conduct before being fired. He concluded that the agencies may have violated federal regulations governing how to reduce a workforce or how to terminate probationary employees.
“Firing probationary employees without individualized cause appears contrary to a reasonable reading of the law, particularly the provisions establishing rules for reductions in force,” Dellinger said in the Monday statement.
Alden Law Group partner Michelle Bercovici said in a statement that Tuesday’s decision “reflects the importance of the MSPB and OSC in safeguarding the fundamental merit system principles and most importantly, allows these wrongfully terminated employees to return to their jobs, provide for their families, and continue serving the public with dignity and integrity.”",True

Trump freezes hiring for many federal jobs,"The White House issued a freeze on the hiring of civilian employees across the government Monday night, exempting active-duty military personnel and positions related to immigration enforcement, national security and public safety.

The order also appears to open the door for the permanent federal personnel reductions that President Donald Trump campaigned on. Within 90 days, the administration is directed to come up with plans to “reduce the size of the Federal Government’s workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition.” Then the hiring freeze will be lifted.

Losing is the Wizards’ way. It might also be their way out.,"The Washington Wizards are in the middle of one of the worst seasons in NBA history.
They won just nine of their first 54 games before the all-star break and have the worst record in the NBA, 3½ games behind the New Orleans Pelicans.
The season extends the franchise’s struggles in the 21st century: The Wizards have the lowest winning percentage of all franchises since Jan. 1, 2000. They also haven’t won at least 50 games in a season — the mark of a very good but not great team — since 1978-79.

The Wizards had been run by Ernie Grunfeld or his top lieutenant, Tommy Sheppard, since 2003. They <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/04/19/wizards-fire-tommy-sheppard/"" target=_blank>broke away from that tree</a> after the 2022-23 season in an organizational overhaul.
Washington <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/05/24/michael-winger-wizards-general-manager/"" target=_blank>hired former Los Angeles Clippers general manager Michael Winger</a> as the president of Monumental Basketball, the group overseeing the Wizards, the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and the G League’s Capital City Go-Go. Winger <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/06/05/will-dawkins-wizards-general-manager/"" target=_blank>brought in General Manager Will Dawkins</a>, who previously worked with Winger with the Oklahoma City Thunder.
Weeks after the two were hired, they began an intense rebuild that included trading stars Bradley Beal and Kristaps Porzingis.
An oversimplified description of Washington’s new strategy: Lose a lot, get high draft picks, accumulate young talent, and develop it into a winning core.
The Wizards won just 15 games in 2023-24. They’re on pace for even fewer this season and have often lost by wide margins. Until recently, they were en route to having the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/01/30/wizards-lakers-lebron-james/"" target=_blank>worst average point differential</a> in NBA history.
A recent positive stretch (more on that later) has bumped them up to third worst.

Winger and Dawkins have overseen two drafts in D.C. They have made four first-round picks, including <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/26/wizards-deni-avdija-trade-trail-blazers/"" target=_blank>three last year</a>, and acquired another rookie this month <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/05/kyle-kuzma-trade-khris-middleton/"" target=_blank>in the Kyle Kuzma trade</a>.
The Wizards haven’t been shy about playing their youth, believing in-game repetitions — going through the fire, as Coach Brian Keefe often puts it — is the best way to develop. Injuries to Kuzma and guard Malcolm Brogdon early this season increased the young players’ minutes and roles.

The development process often has been ugly — as evidenced by two 16-game losing streaks, each tying the franchise record.
Washington almost always has multiple players on the court who have yet to reach their physical primes or maximize their skills — players who are often committing youthful mistakes and undergoing growing pains. The Wizards have the NBA’s worst offensive and defensive ratings (points scored and allowed per 100 possessions), per Basketball Reference.
Those young players seem to be improving, an increased comfort somewhat evident in the Wizards’ recent positive stretch. In February, the team jumped to 11th in offensive rating and 21st in defensive rating, per analytics site Cleaning the Glass. The month even featured a season-best three-game winning streak.

But Wizards fans probably don’t want to see their team win <i>too much</i> over the final 28 games. Though the NBA flattened the lottery odds so the three worst teams have the same chance at netting the No. 1 draft pick, finishing worst means that team can fall only as far as fifth.

This season undoubtedly has been painful, evident in the red on all of these graphs. Winger, Dawkins and the rest of the organization hope the short-term struggles lead to a high draft pick and eventually the type of sustainable winner that has been absent in Washington for nearly 50 years.",False
Acting ICE director removed amid White House pressure to boost arrests,"The Trump administration has removed the top official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement one month into his tenure, as White House officials have become <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/ice-arrests-immigration-deportations/"" target=_blank>increasingly frustrated</a> that the agency isn’t arresting immigrants fast enough to satisfy the president’s deportation goals.
Caleb Vitello, a veteran ICE official who was installed as acting director when President Donald Trump took office, will be reassigned to a senior role overseeing daily enforcement operations, according to Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. She did not say who would replace him.
Trump has ordered ICE to carry out the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/interactive/2025/trump-immigrants-mass-deportations/?itid=ap_nickmiroff_9"" target=_blank>largest mass deportation campaign</a> in U.S. history and quickly ramp up the number of immigrants it arrests each day. Despite the administration dedicating a rush of resources to the effort that has included sending thousands of troops to the southern border and assigning thousands of agents and officers from the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies, ICE’s budget and staffing remain largely unchanged, leaving officers scrambling to meet aggressive arrest quotas.
In late January, Vitello told ICE’s 25 field office directors they should arrest at least 75 immigrants per day for a national <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/26/ice-arrests-raids-trump-quota/"" target=_blank>daily total of 1,200 to 1,500</a>. ICE officers have been working six and even seven days a week since then, but Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem and Trump “border czar” Tom Homan have blamed agency officials for falling far short of those goals. Homan did not respond to requests for comment.
Louisiana Secretary of Wildlife and Fisheries<b> </b>Madison Sheahan, a former campaign aide to Noem, is expected to become acting deputy director of ICE, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a position that hadn’t been publicly announced. Sheahan was also <a href=""https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2023/01/19/sheahan-named-executive-director-sd-gop/"" target=_blank>executive director</a> of the South Dakota GOP. A DHS official said that “positions are being reevaluated” and that the agency had “nothing new to announce at this time.”
ICE averaged more than 800 arrests per day nationwide in late January in the 10 days after Trump took office, publishing its results on social media amid a publicity campaign that <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/28/new-york-city-ice-raid/"" target=_blank>invited television crews</a> to embed with officers. The pace of arrests slowed during the first two weeks of February to fewer than 600 daily, and ICE stopped publishing data on social media, saying it would move to a monthly format.
Current and former ICE officials said the enforcement blitz in late January depleted the lists of targets ICE developed before Trump took office with the names, addresses and other data on immigrants they could arrest. Officer teams have not had time to build out new target lists.

Noem has accused FBI agents of leaking sensitive information about upcoming immigration enforcement operations, which the law enforcement agency has pushed back on.<b> </b>The enforcement teams generally do not possess criminal arrest warrants that would allow them to force their way into their targets’ residences.

A Trump administration official said that Vitello will now oversee field and enforcement operations as part of an effort to expand the team. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the personnel move, said Noem made the decision and it was not done at Trump’s direction.
Vitello’s removal was first reported Friday by <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ice-leadership-changes-trump-deportations-1856e1bb"" target=_blank>The Wall Street Journal</a>. Several ICE staffers said news of his demotion caught them by surprise, and they found out through news alerts.
Jason Houser, chief of staff for ICE under President Joe Biden, said that the White House is asking ICE to “defy the math” and do things that are “unrealistic.”
“The White House needs to look in the mirror,” Houser said. “The dysfunction isn’t with ICE rank-and-file who are trying to do their jobs effectively.”
The Trump administration has sought to take an<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/ice-arrests-immigration-deportations/"" target=_blank> all-of-government approach </a>to immigration enforcement, treating it as a near wartime effort.

Trump has backed a competing, more expansive plan in the House.
The Biden administration deported 271,000 people in fiscal year 2024, the highest annual total in a decade. Deportations during Trump’s first term reached a peak of about 267,000 during the 2019 fiscal year, even as he made similar promises. ICE would need to deport more than 2,700 people a day to hit 1 million deportations a year, a goal that veteran immigration officials say is improbable.",True

Trump appoints leader of his Secret Service detail to head agency,"President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he is appointing Sean Curran — the special agent in charge of Trump’s security detail who shielded him during an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally last year — to serve as the next U.S. Secret Service director.
“Sean has distinguished himself as a brilliant leader, who is capable of directing and leading operational security plans for some of the most complex Special Security Events in the History of our Country, and the World,” Trump <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113874811205486989"" target=_blank>wrote </a>in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social. “He proved his fearless courage when he risked his own life to help save mine from an assassin’s bullet in Butler, Pennsylvania. I have complete and total confidence in Sean to make the United States Secret Service stronger than ever before.”
Curran is widely respected for his rigor and skills as a protective detail agent and supervisor, growing extremely close to Trump after serving as the agent in charge of his detail for the past four years. It was Curran, however, who approved assigning a junior detail agent with minimal experience to prepare the security plan for the campaign visit to Butler, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/12/31/butler-trump-secret-service-shooting/"" target=_blank>a plan that failed</a> to address basic security protocols and allowed a would-be assassin a clear shot at Trump from higher ground.
Trump’s appointment of Curran will hearten some longtime agents but also ignores the recommendations of multiple expert panels who have studied the Secret Service’s security failures and recommended fresh leadership from outside the agency.
Trump is following a long line of presidents before him by naming a key member of his protection team as the agency’s director, rather than choosing someone outside the Secret Service to give it fresh leadership who can revamp and harden its approach to protection.",True

Judge allows intelligence agencies to fire officers in DEI roles,"A federal judge on Thursday refused to stop the CIA and director of national intelligence from firing 51 officers who had been assigned to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility roles that were scrapped last month by President Donald Trump. The officers may not appeal to civil service boards, and they may not transfer to other jobs in the intelligence community because agency rules allow the director to fire employees without any recourse.
In three court hearings this month, U.S. District Judge Anthony J. Trenga questioned why the Trump administration decided to fire all of the officials instead of reassigning them, as had been recommended by career-services officials at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
“These are talented, experienced assets, if you will, that would be in the interests of the United States to be reassigned elsewhere, if that need existed,” Trenga said at a hearing Monday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.
But government lawyers said CIA Director John Ratcliffe relied on a regulation particular to the intelligence community stating that “any employee may be terminated from the Agency at any time without regard to any procedural steps … when the [director], in his discretion, deems it necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States.” Assistant U.S. Attorney Dennis Barghaan said that prevented the employees from being reassigned.
Kevin T. Carroll, a lawyer for the fired officers, argued that “in the interest of the United States” meant that the employee was being fired for reasons related to national security, and that there should be individualized findings before anyone is released. But Trenga said the court didn’t have jurisdiction over an administrative claim unless the agency waived its sovereign immunity, and that the officers probably wouldn’t prevail on the issues that their First Amendment right to free speech and their Fifth Amendment right to due process were violated.
“In effect, they are at-will employees,” the judge ruled. “The regulations make it clear they have no property interest in the employment they have.”
As the disappointed officers looked on, Carroll said afterward: “We respect the court’s decision. I would certainly hope, given the judge’s remarks, that Director Ratcliffe would consider allowing the plaintiffs to apply for other jobs.” He said one of the fired officers had eight other job offers within the CIA, as a data scientist, but was prevented from accepting one.
The lawsuit was filed by 19 anonymous intelligence officers who said they had been temporarily assigned to DEI roles within their agencies and were now being scapegoated “in the service of a partisan ideological agenda.” Some of the employees have been on the job for two decades, according to court records. Ten of the employees were in court for Thursday’s ruling, but declined to comment afterward.
Earlier, Carroll said the career intelligence officers had been trained at taxpayers’ expense to perform some of the most sensitive spy jobs — “from source development to recruitment” and “collection to analysis” — and that they were being fired despite being qualified for other open positions at their agencies. Some stand to lose the government pensions they had been working toward for years, the lawyer said.
“None of these officers’ activities was or is illegal, and at no time have the agencies employing Plaintiffs contended that they individually engaged in any misconduct, nor are they accused of poor performance,” Carroll said in a legal filing. Their job duties included “advancing the hiring, promotion and advancement of members of protected classes,” and firing them for performing assigned work would violate their constitutional rights, he said.
According to court records, the officers were placed on administrative leave with pay two days after Trump signed an executive order last month terminating all DEI programs in the executive branch. Weeks later, some of the officers were told to report to their agencies’ visitor centers with their badges and without lawyers. That’s what it looks like when an intelligence community member is about to get fired or placed on leave without pay, one of the anonymous CIA officers said in a court filing.
The intelligence officer defended the need for diversity among the agency’s ranks. Blending in “racially and culturally” among foreign populations is key to intelligence collection, he said. “There are needs for dual citizenship documentation, foreign language skills and/or overseas living experiences,” the officer said, noting that in some cultural settings, women will not meet alone with men.
Justice Department attorneys said in a legal filing that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard had not finalized any plans to fire officers in DEI roles. But Gabbard and Ratcliffe have unqualified authority to fire any of their employees, and Ratcliffe has chosen to use it, the attorneys argued.
Ratcliffe in a court filing said he could terminate any CIA employee under provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, “when, in my discretion, I deem it ‘necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.’ ” Shutting down the CIA’s diversity and inclusion office and firing all its employees met that standard, he said.
The DEI-related firings could affect not just the 19 intelligence officers who sued but a total of 51 employees at the CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence, their attorneys said. At the CIA, they said, the mass ouster “suggests an unlawful effort … to misuse the Director’s unique national security-related authorities to evade federal equal opportunity laws.”
Trenga said he was puzzled by the CIA’s decision not to reassign the officers. Agency regulations state that any employees who are terminated as part of a downsizing should be offered open positions, he said. Justice Department attorneys said Ratcliffe fired the employees under a different regulation that provides no such job protections.
“I frankly don’t quite understand why that’s being resisted by the agency,” the judge said at the hearing Monday. Trenga was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush and presides over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in addition to serving as a federal district court judge in Virginia.
Attorneys for the CIA officers said the agency’s career service has identified at least one suitable open position for each of them.",True
Native leaders warn that freezing of federal funds could imperil some services,"Native American leaders said they’re worried about the impact of a freeze on federal grants and loans that could affect dozens of programs that provide a range of services including food, health care, education, housing and law enforcement.
The United States has more than 570 federally recognized tribes, and many receive some type of funds to provide programs and services for their tribal citizens through the federal government.
Advocates and leaders in tribal communities said they’re concerned that many tribes are not in a financial position to fully fund their citizens’ needs without federal money.
“Everybody is scrambling in Indian Country,” said Brian Weeden, chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe in Massachusetts, which has about 4,000 enrolled citizens and whose tribe receives grant funds from the federal government.
“Tribes are trying to figure it out,” he said, “and draw down programs to make sure they can stay afloat.”
Josh Arce, president and chief executive of Partnership with Native Americans — a nonprofit group that provides services and aid to more than 150 tribal communities in remote areas of the Southwest and northern plains — said “we’re pretty surprised” about the freeze.
“It’s not something we thought we’d wake up to on a Tuesday morning,” he said, “and it could impact so many things for Native American communities, from road and bridge programs to childhood education and nutrition efforts for the elderly.”
Arce said some tribes use the federal grants for much-needed services, and “if they don’t have the ability to offset the loss, we don’t know what that could look like for continuing essential programs or starting new programs for the year.”
“That means communities that have basic needs could see those needs go unmet,” he said. Programs that pay for firewood or propane gas to heat homes or distribute food could be hurt, he said.",True
"‘Interviewing two brothers:’ Trump, Musk speak about relationship","Seated side-by-side on prime-time television, President Donald Trump raved about Elon Musk’s intellect and business acumen to Fox News host Sean Hannity, insisting during a joint interview that their relationship is thriving as they seek to reshape the federal government together.
“Well, I respect him,” Trump said. “I’ve always respected him. I never knew that he was right on certain things, and I’m usually pretty good at this stuff.”
Trump said he “wanted to find someone smarter than him,” but “couldn’t do it.”
The interview comes amid mounting outside scrutiny of Musk’s role within the White House — and whether his fate will resemble past outspoken advisers Trump booted in his first term.
Referring to the world’s richest man as “actually a very good businessman,” Trump said that Musk has ensured that his flurry of executive orders are being enforced, but steered clear of saying Musk was the brains behind any of them.
“He gets it done,” Trump said. Musk, for his part, described himself as “tech support” for carrying out Trump’s executive orders.
“I feel like I’m interviewing two brothers here,” Hannity said.",False
Suit charges violation of Privacy Act as DOGE accesses personal data,"A coalition of labor unions and individuals filed suit in federal court Monday alleging that Elon Musk and the U.S. DOGE Service have been given access to sensitive records of millions of American in violation of the Privacy Act.
The suit alleges that DOGE staff who do not have appropriate security clearances or vetting have been given access to personal information at the Education Department, which has private information of 43 million student borrowers; the Treasury Department, whose records include information on every American who receives a tax refund or Social Security benefit; and the Office of Personnel Management, which has personal information for every federal employee.
The suit was filed by the American Federation of Teachers, the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the National Federation of Federal Employees. Several individuals are also named as plaintiffs.
“Defendants are permitting Elon Musk and a cadre of loyalists imported from his private companies to help themselves to the personal information of millions of Americans” in violation of the Privacy Act, the suit charges. “Steamrolling into sensitive government record systems threatens to upend how these critical systems are maintained and compromises the safety and security of personal identifying information for Americans all across the country. It also violates federal law.”",True
Judge briefly extends order barring Trump from firing watchdog leader,"A federal judge on Wednesday extended for three days an order preventing the Trump administration from firing the head of an independent watchdog agency that has sought to pause President Donald Trump’s mass termination of some probationary federal workers.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she wanted more time to consider the lawyers’ arguments before issuing a broader ruling on whether the administration’s attempted ouster of Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, was unlawful. A temporary restraining order barring Dellinger’s firing will remain in place until Saturday, she said.
Dellinger, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sued the administration after he received a one-sentence email earlier this month telling him he was fired from the office, which protects government whistleblowers. He said his termination violated a law that says the president can remove him only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.” Jackson on Feb. 12 ordered him reinstated for two weeks while his case proceeds.
The Trump administration argues that the Constitution allows Trump to remove Dellinger and other agency leaders.
On Tuesday, an independent federal board <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/probationary-employee-firings-trump-musk-doge/"" target=""_blank"">granted a request</a> by Dellinger to halt the administration’s firings of six probationary government employees. Dellinger said the firings of those employees, and potentially many others, were <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/24/hampton-dellinger-special-counsel-filing-probationary-employees/"" target=""_blank"">probably illegal</a>.
In court Wednesday morning, Jackson sharply questioned claims by the Trump administration’s lawyer that Trump had the power to fire Dellinger without cause and that the law prohibiting him from doing so was unconstitutional. Unlike other agency heads, the special counsel was granted independence from the president to investigate potential wrongdoing by the administration, the judge said. Dellinger was appointed to a five-year term that ends in 2029.
“His actual job is to be a check and balance on the president,” Jackson said.
The judge pressed Justice Department lawyer Madeline McMahon to explain why it would be in the public interest to fire Dellinger.
McMahon said barring Dellinger’s removal would cause Trump to “lose control over an executive branch agency” and would represent an “intrusion” into Trump’s authority under the Constitution.",True
Snow and slush didn’t dampen street style at New York Fashion Week,"NEW YORK — When I was sent to photograph New York Fashion Week in September 2024, many people I spoke with were shocked to hear it was my first time. I’ve been working as a photographer for 25 years, but in this arena, I felt something like an alien. Coming back this week for a second time was more familial. One word that comes to mind, to sum it all up, is <i>community</i>. It’s remarkable, and to state the obvious — beautiful — to see the art of garments, hats, shoes and accessories, celebrated with such reverence and a kinship among fashion fans and favorites.
February’s fashion seemed extra chilly with a dash of snowflakes. I had hoped to get images of models in the streets as several inches of snow fell, but that didn’t happen with much of the snow coming overnight. But the slick, slushy sidewalks were not enough to keep people from showing up in their finest.
Sure, most of these folks were headed inside to witness the latest designs come down the runways. But the real circus is indeed outside of these events. Dozens of fashion editors, models, designers, stylists and even the want-to-be-seen parade down the streets — sometimes even stopping traffic. I saw amateur and professional photographers turning their lenses on fashionistas in the middle of intersections as motorists angrily honked their horns. This is where all the action is.
I’m highly attracted to the fun chaos of it all. Folks proudly sashaying down alleys. People wearing garments of all kinds — some they made themselves. The funniest accessory I saw at a fashion show was a cheetah-printed bong, and the model had the pants to match. It is indeed a community, an eclectic one at that.",False

"After under-the-radar retool, D.C. United hopes to ‘prove people wrong’","<a href=""https://www.dcunited.com/"" target=_blank>D.C. United</a> spent the offseason acquiring more than a dozen players, accounting for about half the roster. The goalkeeping corps is new. An Aussie center back arrived from Scotland, a Brazilian winger via Poland. Five newcomers are expected to start Saturday night’s opener against Toronto FC at Audi Field.
Why, then, does it feel as if United did not accomplish much this winter?
Perhaps because, unlike many teams around MLS, United did not make any blockbuster trades or sign a high-priced international player. Instead, it acquired three players who missed most of last season with injuries and four who toiled most, if not all, of 2024 in the second division. Two other acquisitions were MLS backups. Three came from overseas with modest fanfare, another through the college draft.
“For those that have that perception, that’s understandable,” United Coach Troy Lesesne said of the restrained activity. “We’ve signed some players that may not carry that type of [big] name but are very talented themselves. They fit our game model, and we believe in them, and we hope that D.C. United is going to be a platform for them to take off in their career.”
United has one of MLS’s biggest names: captain <a href=""https://www.mlssoccer.com/players/christian-benteke/"" target=_blank>Christian Benteke</a>, MLS’s scoring champion. He is D.C.’s only designated player — the label for talent that exceeds salary cap restrictions and requires ownership to pay mostly out of pocket. Each team is allowed to employ up to three DPs.
United’s second slot remains filled by team assists leader Mateusz Klich, even though he is no longer on the roster. Though he was <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/19/dc-united-mateusz-klich-trade/"" target=_blank>traded to Atlanta</a>, most of his contract remains on United’s books.
Although Lesesne and his players are upbeat, United failed to generate any offseason buzz in MLS circles. Accordingly, <a href=""https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/ranking-all-30-mls-teams-by-tier-for-2025"" target=""_blank"">preseason predictions</a> have D.C. missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive year and finishing at or near the bottom of the 15-team Eastern Conference.
“You want to be the team that’s looked at as the big dogs in the league. You want to be one of the favorites and have that privilege of having the target on your back,” all-star right back Aaron Herrera said. “But at the same time, we’re realistic with ourselves. We saw what we did last year and where we ended up. So how do we expect to be [higher in] anyone’s prediction? We’re here to prove people wrong.”
Since Lesense and <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/28/ally-mackay-dc-united-new-gm/"" target=_blank>General Manager Ally Mackay</a> took over before the 2024 season, the roster has been gutted. Benteke and injured midfielder Jackson Hopkins are the only players remaining from the 2023 opener.
This year’s squad features not only 13 newcomers but four holdovers who either arrived deep into last season or missed most of the year with injury.
Returning center back Lucas Bartlett has a new partner: Australia’s Kye Rowles, a 2022 World Cup starter who played the past 2½ years for Hearts in Scotland. The new starting goalkeeper is Kim Joon Hong, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/13/kim-joon-hong-dc-united/"" target=""_blank"">a 21-year-old South Korean</a>.
Hosei Kijima, a rookie midfielder for St. Louis City last year, drew rave reviews from teammates in the preseason. Costa Rican Randall Leal (Nashville) and Brazilian <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/16/dc-united-signs-joao-peglow/"" target=_blank>João Peglow</a> (Polish league) also hope to bolster the attack. Brazilian playmaker <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/gabriel-pirani-brazil-united/"" target=_blank>Gabriel Pirani</a>, in his second full season in Washington, is aiming for a breakout year after showing bright signs late last season.
Lesesne will also need players to show improvement after mixed performances last year.
“When I look at myself, I’m not saying I wasted a year, but as a young player, every year you want to take big steps forward,” said Matti Peltola, a 22-year-old midfielder. “If I’m not going to be able to take big steps forward this year, then I’m really looking [in] the mirror, big time.”
With some roster space and cap flexibility, United could continue to make changes until the initial roster deadline April 23. The summer transfer window, which opens in July, typically offers an abundant international marketplace.
“We created a good group,” Benteke said. “Even though I’m the captain [and] I’m the leader, I believe the star of the team is going to be the group because the way we want to play, we will need all of us.”
Lesesne has retained a high-pressure style designed to force turnovers and create immediate opportunities. In the preseason, he implemented a plan that also won’t rely as heavily on Benteke (23 goals) and will generate a wider variety of chances.
“It’s in constant evolution and improvement,” Lesesne said. “If you watched us in preseason, you could see, ‘Okay, they’re trying to go for something a little bit different.’”
Defensively, United will need to tighten up not only in its own end but in transition. Last year, teams often unlocked D.C.’s press and capitalized on open space. United conceded 70 goals, third most in MLS and second most in club history.
“The intensity of the press is still going to be the same,” Herrera said. “But there’s a couple different pieces, couple different moving parts.”
United will also need to improve its home performance after ending 2024 in a 1-6-5 rut at Audi Field and 4-8-5 overall. The team will play three of its first four matches at Buzzard Point, and none of those four opponents had a winning record last year.
While championship aspirations seem far-fetched, Lesesne and the players say they see promise after <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/10/19/dc-united-misses-playoffs-charlotte-fc/"" target=_blank>narrowly missing the playoffs </a>last fall.
(The front office also sees promise: To entice former season ticket holders to return, United promised a 30 percent rebate if the team fails to make the playoffs.)
“We were competitive last year, and we started to show ourselves in terms of the proof of concept was there,” Lesesne said. “We want to build on that, but we have to take a bigger step this year. I don’t want to be around this position of nine, 10, 11 [in the standings] and just be in the mix. I’d like us to take a step forward.”

Layoffs to hit IRS as DOGE targets tax collections,"The Trump administration is expected to begin laying off thousands of employees at the Internal Revenue Service, six people briefed on the matter said, as billionaire Elon Musk’s team begins to target tax collections.
Treasury officials have discussed laying off roughly 9,000 employees still in their probationary period as part of broader dismissals across the government of recently hired workers, according to the six people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal conversations. That number could not be immediately confirmed, and spokespeople both for the IRS and Treasury declined to comment. The cuts could start as soon as Friday.
The layoffs are likely targeting tax collection, several of the people briefed on the matter said. Indeed, associates of Musk’s team are beginning to meet with high-ranking IRS officials about what could prove dramatic changes to the tax agency. Gavin Kliger, a software engineer now working at the IRS, met with Ken Corbin, the IRS’s chief of taxpayer services, and Heather Maloy, the agency’s top enforcement official, during his first day at the agency’s headquarters Thursday, according to several of the people familiar with the meetings.
Republicans have long aimed to shrink the tax agency and were particularly incensed by the Biden administration’s push to hire thousands of new IRS agents to increase tax enforcement and collections. The cuts to federal personnel are likely to weaken the Biden administration’s efforts to bolster the IRS, though to what extent remains uncertain.
The tax agency grew by about 10 percent last year, as its ranks swelled from roughly 90,000 employees in fiscal year 2023 to 100,000 employees this fiscal year. The IRS has said publicly that personnel critical to the tax filing season are ineligible for the “deferred resignation” plan that encouraged federal personnel to quit. That has fueled speculation that the cuts to IRS personnel will be concentrated among the agency’s tax collection staff, which could reduce the amount of revenue brought into federal coffers even as Musk calls for a reduced deficit.
“It’s quite distressing, because the Biden administration made serious efforts to bolster enforcement. I think all of that is in jeopardy now,” said Steve Rosenthal, who served as a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. “Stripping the IRS of resources is a windfall for those who like to game the system, and those are the most sophisticated and richest taxpayers.”
Congressional Republicans are likely to welcome DOGE’s changes to the IRS. On Thursday, Rep. Jason T. Smith (R-Missouri), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, wrote a letter to IRS’s acting commissioner blasting the $80 billion funding increase for the tax agency, among other measures.
“President Trump has shown in his first three weeks that he meant what he said during the presidential campaign. Our government has not been working effectively for the American people, and it needs to change,” Smith’s letter states.
Congress had given <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/06/inflation-reduction-act-irs/"" target=""_blank"">the IRS $80 billion</a> over 10 years through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, but<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/26/irs-funding-cut-20-billion-shutdown/"" target=""_blank""> Congress rescinded $20 billion</a> of that.
Within the agency, the impending job cuts are being met with dread, both for individuals and the health of the tax system. The vast majority of Treasury employees work for the IRS.
IRS employees cheered the Biden administration’s funding boosts, which yielded almost immediate performance and IT improvements. Now rolling those back — and cutting thousands of freshly hired employees — could send the agency into a tailspin in the middle of filing season.
“It’s going to be like going off a cliff immediately,” said David Carrone, a revenue agent and president of the Louisiana-Arkansas National Treasury Employees Union chapter.

Education Dept. launches investigation into Maine over transgender policies,"The Education Department announced Friday that it was launching an investigation into a Maine high school and the state’s education agency, after a tense exchange between President Donald Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) over transgender students.
Earlier in the day, Trump warned during a session with the Republican Governor’s Association that Maine risks losing federal funding if it continues to allow transgender students to participate in girls’ sports, despite his executive order aiming to ban that.
Mills responded: “We’re going to follow the law, sir. We’ll see you in court.”
On Friday, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights announced an investigation.
“Maine would have you believe that it has no choice in how it treats women and girls in athletics — that is, that it must follow its state laws and allow male athletes to compete against women and girls,” Craig Trainor, the Education Department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights,<a href=""https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/office-civil-rights-launches-title-ix-violation-investigations-maine-department-of-education-and-maine-school-district"" target=_blank> said in a statement.</a> “Let me be clear: If Maine wants to continue to receive federal funds from the Education Department, it has to follow Title IX.”
Mills responded promptly saying the state was standing firm.
“If the President attempts to unilaterally deprive Maine school children of the benefit of Federal funding, my Administration and the Attorney General will take all appropriate and necessary legal action to restore that funding and the academic opportunity it provides. The State of Maine will not be intimidated by the President’s threats,” Mills <a href=""https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-statement-presidents-threat-withhold-education-funding-maine-2025-02-21"" target=""_blank"">replied in a statement</a>.",True
Judge forces lawyers for fired inspectors general to withdraw TRO request,"Lawyers for eight inspectors general suing the Trump administration over their firings last month were forced by an angry federal judge to withdraw their motion seeking a temporary restraining order.
Judge Ana C. Reyes of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia tore into the attorneys for the plaintiffs in a brief but heated hearing on Friday afternoon.
Reyes demanded to know why the plaintiffs’ attorneys waited 21 days after the firings <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/12/trump-fired-inspectors-general-lawsuit/"" target=_blank>to file their lawsuit</a>, only to then seek emergency same-day relief. She ticked off the list of emergency actions that have flooded the federal dockets and then limited the attorneys to “yes” and “no” answers.
She also objected to the plaintiffs’ counsel comparing the facts of their case to those of Hampton Dellinger, the fired head of the Office of Special Counsel who <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/10/trump-office-of-special-counsel-firing-lawsuit/3195b7de-e7ce-11ef-969b-cfbefacb1eb3_story.html"" target=""_blank"">sued the Trump administration last week</a>. Dellinger argued in his complaint that his termination violated a law that shields the leaders of independent agencies from removal by the president. The inspectors general, however, are arguing that their firing was illegal because Trump did not give Congress 30 days’ notice of his decision as required by law.
After forcing the plaintiffs to withdraw their motion for a temporary restraining order, the parties agreed to an expedited schedule. The government must reply to the lawsuit by Feb. 21.
“Why on earth this could not have been decided in a five-minute phone call is beyond me,” Reyes said. She said she considered sanctioning the plaintiff’s attorneys but had more pressing matters on her docket.",True

House speaker suggests Democratic votes could be needed on debt ceiling,"Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) hinted that the GOP-led Congress may have to rely on Democrats to raise the debt ceiling this year in an interview during the House GOP retreat in Doral, Florida.
Though Johnson and many Republicans would like to raise the debt ceiling with only Republican votes, the speaker blamed the Senate’s 60-vote threshold for making that goal difficult. “I think there’s some concern in the Senate that might be difficult to do on a partisan basis,” he said.
Senate Republicans hold 53 seats, meaning they need seven Democrats to agree on passing bills that require a filibuster-proof majority. Republicans are hoping to use and approve of a budgetary maneuver — often referenced as “reconciliation” — that would  lower the filibuster threshold to a simple majority to pass President Donald Trump’s agenda. Some House Republicans would like to tack the debt ceiling onto the reconciliation process — which is expected to address border security, energy and tax changes — because it could be passed with GOP-only votes. But it’s unclear whether the debt ceiling can be included under the strict budgetary parameters of reconciliation.
House Republicans privately say they will need Democratic help, too, given that many fiscal hawks have pledged not to support raising the debt ceiling unless there are substantial spending cuts.",False

EPA puts 168 environmental justice staffers on administrative leave,"Trump appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency notified staff members Thursday that they plan to close the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, and place 168 of its employees on administrative leave.
“Career staff made determinations on which Office of Environmental Justice employees had statutory duties or core mission functions,” EPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said in an email.
“As such, 168 staffers were placed on administrative leave as their function did not relate to the agency’s statutory duties or grant work,” she added. “EPA is in the process of evaluating new structure and organization to ensure we are meeting our mission of protecting human health and the environment for all Americans.”
The Washington Post also obtained an internal email notifying some division employees about being placed on leave.
One employee in the office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, said that staff members have felt various degrees of fear since Trump’s executive orders targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the government.
“It’s clearly an all-out assault on federal workers, and it’s an all-out assault on the most marginalized communities in the United States and across the world,” the staffer said.

"Pentagon to fire 5,400 civilian employees in ‘initial’ purge","The Pentagon said Friday that it will fire about 5,400 civilian employees beginning next week in an “initial” purge of its workforce, as President Donald Trump’s hastily issued orders to shake up the Defense Department faced new scrutiny and officials scrambled to understand whether such actions could imperil national security.
The announcement followed a day of uncertainty, as administration officials paused a plan to begin firings now while evaluating requests to retain thousands of other employees deemed essential. A senior Pentagon official, Darin Selnick, said in a statement late Friday that the Trump administration intends to cull its workforce by between 5 and 8 percent. With more than 900,000 civilian employees in the Defense Department, tens of thousands of people could be forced out eventually.
Echoing <a href=""https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1892702578418327972"" target=_blank>a pronouncement</a> made earlier by Trump’s defense secretary,<b> </b>Pete Hegseth, Selnick said in his statement that “it is simply not in the public interest to retain individuals whose contributions are not mission-critical.”
“Taxpayers deserve to have us take a thorough look at our workforce top-to-bottom to see where we can eliminate redundancies,” Selnick added. The cuts are necessary, he said, “to produce efficiencies and refocus” the Pentagon on Trump’s national security priorities.
The firings are not expected to target U.S. troops. The Pentagon oversees about 1.3 million active-duty service members and nearly 800,000 more who are in the National Guard and reserves.
The cuts will come after Trump administration officials, coordinating with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service, have slashed thousands of employees elsewhere in the government as part of the president’s broad effort to dismantle the federal bureaucracy.
The Defense Department’s civilian worker purge is beginning with probationary employees, those who have one to three years of experience or who recently were promoted, according to officials familiar with the matter, who like some others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue’s sensitivity. That pool of people numbers between 50,000 and 55,000, officials said.
After deliberations over the last day, the Pentagon has settled on firing about 10 percent of its probational employees, a defense official familiar with the effort said. A hiring freeze is expected to take hold next week, and administration officials plan to spend two to three months analyzing who else could be ousted, the official said.
Supervisors throughout the department, the federal government’s largest, have spent days requesting of the new administration that certain employees should be spared because the work they do is vital to national defense. An email obtained by The Washington Post indicates that Trump officials ultimately decided they need more time to sort through those many cases.
The message, sent Thursday night by Ruth Vetter, a lawyer in the Pentagon general counsel’s office, said that senior officials had informed human resources staff that “they should not initiate removals of probationary employees” on Friday because requests for exemptions citing mission criticality “are still under review.”
Vetter’s email, labeled “PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL,” warned that an employee’s past performance “must be viewed through the current needs and best interest of the government, in light of the President’s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.”
Vetter referred questions to Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot, who did not respond to requests for comment.
Among the agency’s probationary employees are hundreds of teachers who work for the Department of Defense Education Activity, a school system that educates about 67,000 students — mostly the children of service members — at military installations around the globe. One person familiar with the matter said that DoDEA officials were attempting to save teachers from Trump’s purge of the federal workforce, but it was unclear if the effort would be successful. A DoDEA spokesman declined to comment.
At the Office of Naval Intelligence, which provides senior military officials with maritime threat assessments and related analysis, employees were called to a meeting Thursday at their headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, where they were told that all probationary workers would be terminated, said one intelligence analyst.
The analyst went to work Friday expecting to be out of a job, but was informed that no further instructions had been received. “Don’t get your hopes up too much,” he said he was told.
The analyst, an Air Force veteran, said about 60 people in his office could be fired, and voiced frustration that he and his colleagues are seen by DOGE officials as numbers on a spreadsheet.
“Work is next to impossible right now,” the analyst said. “Morale is through the floor.”
Coinciding with the civilian-worker purge, U.S. defense officials, acting on orders from Hegseth, have undertaken a sprawling effort to compile options for <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/19/trump-pentagon-budget-cuts/"" target=_blank>slashing about 8 percent</a> from each armed service’s budget for each of the next five years. Doing so, Hegseth has said, could yield $50 billion in 2026 to be reinvested elsewhere in the Defense Department, including an expensive missile-defense shield that Trump has taken to calling “Iron Dome For America.”
After news of Hegseth’s directive alarmed lawmakers and defense officials, the former Fox News personality sought to blame the news media for causing confusion about the administration’s efforts and portrayed his plan as a “reorienting” of the Pentagon budget away from “woke, Biden-era nonlethal programs” to “instead spend that money on President Trump’s America First, peace-through-strength priorities for our national budget.”
“It’s not a cut,” Hegseth said in a nearly <a href=""https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1892702578418327972"" target=_blank>nine-minute video</a> posted to social media on Thursday evening. “It’s refocusing and reinvesting existing funds into building a force to protect you, the American people.”
But independent budget analysts said it is highly unlikely that tens of billions of dollars per year can be targeted for reinvestment without slashing some major weapons programs and cutting the number troops in some of the services.
Travis Sharp, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the fiscal 2025 budget under President Joe Biden included $162 million for diversity, equity and inclusion programs and $3.6 billion to build resiliency at Defense Department installations to counter climate change. Even if all of that money is removed from the budget and reprogrammed, he said, it’s a “drop in the bucket” at getting to $50 billion.
To achieve such an ambitious goal, Sharp said, the Pentagon could retire older weapons programs, eliminate newer ones that remain in development, and shrink or shutter individual headquarters and agencies. Similar efforts have been undertaken before, Sharp said, including by Defense Secretary Robert Gates under President Barack Obama, but they still fell well short of Hegseth’s goals.
“What they’re attempting is unprecedented in recent history,” Sharp said.
Mackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said it will take an “all of the above” approach to cut that deeply into existing defense budget to fund new efforts. She noted that in a memo to senior Pentagon officials on Tuesday, Hegseth “walled off” 17 key priorities identified by the Trump administration — including missile defense, submarines, one-way attack drones and border security. So other areas will be especially vulnerable.
“Look, the Defense Department reflects America,” she said. “The largest line item on the balance sheet of most corporations is labor. It’s people. There’s no workforce you can spare. They’re going to have to go after the defense civilian workforce as well as active-duty military end strength.”
Another option the Trump administration could pursue, especially if it seeks to slash billions of dollars in future years for new priorities, is the closure of some existing military bases, Eaglen said. Such efforts — commonly known as base realignment and closure — have been politically unpopular, but could be appealing to Musk, she predicted.
“There is a very compelling case for base closure,” Eaglen said. “If you kind of get into those weeds with people, you can make a rational business case. I actually think Congress could be compelled with a bully [defense secretary] and bully White House.”

Judge temporarily blocks DOGE access to sensitive information at two agencies,"A federal judge on Monday blocked Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service from using private information collected by<b> </b>the Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management.
U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman in Maryland issued a <a href=""https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Dkt-39-Opinion-and-Order-on-TRO.pdf"">temporary restraining order</a> in a lawsuit led by the American Federation of Teachers to stop DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency,<b> </b>from accessing databases containing personal information on millions of Americans. She denied the union’s request to block DOGE from sensitive Treasury Department data because a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/"">preliminary injunction</a> in a separate case achieved that goal.
The order bars the Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management from disclosing personally identifiable information to DOGE affiliates at least until March 10.
“This is a significant decision that puts a firewall between actors who we believe lack the legitimacy and authority to access Americans’ personal data,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers union, which represents 1.8 million workers in education, health care and government.
“When people give their financial and other personal information to the federal government — namely to secure financial aid for their kids to go to college, or to get a student loan — they expect that data to be protected and used for the reasons it was intended, not appropriated for other means,” Weingarten added.
The Education Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neither did DOGE.
The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated the Privacy Act by giving Musk’s team sensitive data for reasons beyond its intended use. DOGE has had<b> </b>access to databases that include home addresses, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers, among other information. The union says such access poses security risks.
In addition to the AFT, the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They are joined by six individuals with sensitive data stored in federal systems, including military veterans who received federal student loans.
The Education Department collects personal information to administer federal financial aid programs. DOGE had gained access to the department’s databases, including Federal Student Aid Partner Connect, the Financial Management System and the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/trump-presidency-news/#link-AFIQUVHY3BF4VHB5UF7HS57W4E"" target=_blank>National Student Loan Data System</a>.
DOGE, according to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/"">previous Washington Post reporting</a>, has been<b> </b>feeding data from across the Education Department into artificial intelligence software to probe the agency’s programs and spending. The effort is part of a push to slash spending and shrink the agency’s staff, as President Donald Trump seeks to dismantle the<b> </b>department.
In the 33-page ruling, Boardman wrote that the government “never explains why” OPM and department personnel need this widespread access to Americans’ private information<b> </b>to carry out the overhaul.
Boardman released the order days after a federal judge in a separate lawsuit <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/18/court-declines-stop-doge-accessing-student-data/"">refused</a> to issue a restraining order to stop Musk’s team from accessing student data at the Education Department, saying<b> </b>there was no immediate threat in allowing it.",True
Democrats settle on candidate for Rep. Stefanik’s seat,"Democratic Party leaders in New York’s 21st Congressional District have backed farmer Blake Gendebien for the anticipated special election to replace Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, President Donald Trump’s pick to be U.N. ambassador.
The party chairs in the 15 counties that make up the district released a statement Tuesday unanimously endorsing Gendebien, calling him a political “outsider” who “embodies the voice and grit that distinguishes this district.”
The race would be an uphill battle for Democrats — Stefanik won reelection last year by over 20 percentage points — but it could serve as a gauge of Democratic enthusiasm in the first months of the second Trump term.

Farmers sue USDA after agency deletes climate change data,"A group of farmers and environmental nonprofits <a href=""https://earthjustice.org/brief/2025/were-suing-to-stop-the-trump-admins-climate-censorship-that-threatens-farmers-and-our-food-supply"" target=""_blank"">sued</a> the U.S. Department of Agriculture, accusing the department of scrubbing data relating to climate change from its website and saying the move would hinder research and hurt farming initiatives.
In a <a href=""https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/usdaclimatewebpagespurgecomplaint_2.24.25_final-1.pdf"" target=_blank>lawsuit</a> filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York (NOFA-NY) and two environmental nonprofits, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group, accused USDA of deleting “climate-related policies, guides, datasets, and resources from its websites” in violation of laws on government transparency and agency action.
The suit said the department’s actions hurt farmers who used the data to plan “agricultural decisions” and access funding, made it more difficult for climate researchers and advocates to do their jobs, and “deprived the public” of “vital information.” USDA websites include the Forest Service, Food Safety and Inspection Service, and Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“USDA should be working to protect our food system from droughts, wildfires, and extreme weather, not denying the public access to critical resources,” <a href=""https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/trump-usda-sued-for-erasing-webpages-vital-to-farmers"" target=""_blank"">said</a> Jeffrey Stein, an attorney at Earthjustice, the legal group that filed the suit.
USDA referred questions from The Washington Post to the Justice Department, which declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Examples cited in the lawsuit include the Farm Service Agency taking down a webpage that <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/federal-agencies-websites-trump/"" target=_blank>told farmers how to apply</a> for climate-smart agriculture and farm loan programs, and the Forest Service deleting an interactive map that allowed users to see where federal agencies have conducted climate change vulnerability assessments and learn more about them.
Earthjustice said the data removal is “part of a trend” under the Trump administration, which has worked to <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/"" target=""_blank"">dismantle climate protections</a> and reverse federal policies aimed at fighting and measuring climate change.

“Taking climate change information off websites, freezing funds, and laying off USDA workers that are helping to protect communities is ludicrous,” said Wes Gillingham, board president of NOFA-NY, which represents  farmers, gardeners and consumers advocating for organic and sustainable food and farming.
According to the suit, on Jan. 30, USDA Director of Digital Communications Peter Rhee told staff members in an email that they had about 24 hours to “identify and archive or unpublish any landing pages focused on climate change,” and instructed them to sort other webpages into tiers based on how much they mentioned climate change and give a “recommendation on how the content should be handled.”
USDA staff members then “acted swiftly to purge department websites of climate-change-focused webpages,” the lawsuit stated — creating confusion and chaos as resources for farmers and the public suddenly became inaccessible, “without any public notice or explanation.”
In recent weeks, government agencies have removed material relating to topics deemed objectionable by President Donald Trump’s administration <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/federal-agencies-websites-trump/"" target=_blank>from their websites</a>, including references to diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as references to climate change and initiatives to combat it.
The lawsuit claimed that in deleting the materials so quickly and without notice, USDA violated the <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-104publ13/pdf/PLAW-104publ13.pdf"" target=_blank>Paperwork Reduction Act</a>, which requires agencies to provide notice when terminating “significant information dissemination products,” and the Freedom of Information Act. The groups also sued under<b> </b>the <a href=""https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10558"" target=_blank>Administrative Procedure Act</a>, which allows people to request judicial reviews of certain harmful agency actions.
The suit asked the court to declare USDA’s actions unlawful and order the department to restore the deleted webpages and not to comply further with the Jan. 30 directive.

Acting IRS commissioner to step down amid DOGE blitz on agency,"The acting commissioner of the IRS will announce he is stepping down as early as Tuesday, according to four people familiar with the matter who said the departure is driven in part over his distress about the chaos inflicted on the government by billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service.
Doug O’Donnell, a civil servant who spent several decades at the agency, will depart the administration by the end of the week, said the people, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. He is expected to be replaced on a temporary basis by Melanie Krause, who has also served in senior positions at the tax agency, the people said. President Trump has nominated <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/05/billy-long-irs-commissioner-trump/"" target=""_blank"">Billy Long</a>, a former Republican congressman from Missouri, to run the agency on a more permanent basis, if he is confirmed by the Senate.
O’Donnell’s expected departure comes at a pivotal time for the IRS, which faces a crush from tax filing season and fresh scrutiny from Musk’s team.
The people familiar with the matter said O’Donnell was concerned by many of the moves Musk made on the government, including firing probationary employees. As part of Musk-driven cuts, about 7,000 IRS employees are <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/20/irs-layoffs-trump-firings-doge/"" target=_blank>expected to lose their jobs</a>, a person familiar with the matter has said.

The White House also has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/16/doge-irs-access-taxpayer-data/"" target=_blank>been working on a memorandum of understanding</a> to give DOGE officials broad access to IRS systems, property and databases.

The memorandum claims that many NGOs “are engaged in actions that actively undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people” and that it’s the policy of the Trump administration “to stop funding NGOs that undermine the national interest.”
The memo directs agency heads to “align future funding decisions with the interests of the United States and with the goals and priorities of my Administration.”
The memorandum is the latest in a series of efforts by Trump to scrutinize federal spending on humanitarian efforts and other forms of international aid.
<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/25/trump-abortion-global-gag-rule-mexico-city-policy/"" target=_blank>In some countries</a>, especially less developed ones, NGOs are sometimes the only providers of reproductive health care. Last month, Trump reinstated a policy that restricts access to safe abortions in counties that rely on U.S.-funded programs.
Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem said she would cut off agency funding for NGOs that she said were using federal funds to assist in illegal migration into the United States.
The administration <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/04/usaid-trump-foreign-aid/"" target=_blank>has also moved</a> to shrink the U.S. Agency for International Development, which administers humanitarian aid programs.

Former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio arrested outside U.S. Capitol,"U.S. Capitol Police arrested former Proud Boys leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio on Friday following an exchange with a woman who showed up to protest a news conference he called outside the U.S. Capitol.
Tarrio, 43, was charged with simple assault after authorities say she shoved her phone in his face and he struck her phone and arm. Officers witnessed the exchange, which they said in a statement occurred as Tarrio was walking near Delaware Avenue NE and D Street NE.
“The woman told our officers that she wanted to be a complainant, and the man was arrested for the simple assault,” Capitol Police spokesman Tim Barber said in<b> </b>the statement.
In response to a request for comment, Tarrio wrote in a text message: “I have no problem with people screaming or bullhorn if us but the moment you put your hands on me...which she did...I’m reacting. In this case...I launched her phone.”
The alleged confrontation came after Tarrio announced plans to file a lawsuit against the Department of Justice in response to the Capitol riot prosecutions “for their murders, their lies and the endless suffering they have put us through.” Tarrio said Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola — Proud Boys who were convicted and imprisoned for their role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack — will be joining him as plaintiffs.
Tarrio said they will be filing the suit in “the next two to three weeks maximum” and did not share further details. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes said at the news conference that he will be filing a separate lawsuit.
Once filed, these suits could force the Trump administration to either defend the prosecutions related to the Jan. 6 attack or pay damages to the Proud Boys at taxpayers’ expense.
Tarrio and other speakers at the news conference were found guilty of seditious conspiracy in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the building as lawmakers were attempting to certify election results. <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/interactive/2025/jan-6-trump-pardons/"" target=_blank>More than 140 officers</a> were wounded and three people died as a result of medical emergencies suffered during the riot. Four police officers who worked that day later died by suicide.
“We will not allow the government to rewrite history,” Tarrio, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/20/trump-pardons-jan-6-defendants/"" target=_blank>who was sentenced to 22 years in prison</a>, said during the news conference, held roughly a month after Trump pardoned virtually all Capitol riot defendants and commuted the sentences of the remaining 14.
“The government overplayed their hand. They thought we would break,” he said. “They thought we would fail. But look at us now.”
Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia) <a href=""https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=6255"" target=_blank>sent a letter</a> to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) on Friday expressing his concern that Tarrio and Rhodes returned to the Capitol on Friday and requesting Johnson “take meaningful action by acknowledging and condemning the violence that occurred on January 6th.”
“President Trump’s pardons breathe new life into and embolden violent extremists, posing a real danger to our fellow Members of Congress and their staffs, the Capitol Police, and the millions of visitors to the Capitol each year,” he wrote.
Tarrio was arrested Jan. 4, 2021, and later served four months in prison for burning a Black Lives Matter flag at a historic downtown African American church during a post-2020 election Trump demonstration. Tarrio pleaded guilty to destruction of property along with attempted possession of a high-capacity ammunition magazine found in his luggage when he was arrested after arriving in Washington for Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, demonstration.
Tarrio said in an interview earlier this week that he returned to Washington to reunite with other Proud Boys in town for the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.
During the news conference, a few protesters brought a noise machine and megaphone to heckle the speakers, calling them “Nazis” and “terrorists,” while Tarrio, Rhodes and other Proud Boys repeated a revisionist history of the attack that cast themselves as persecuted patriots. Capitol Police kept the two groups apart, and there did not appear to be any physical confrontations at that time.
The small crowd of Proud Boys and others involved in the Jan. 6 attack then walked around the outside of the U.S. Capitol, taking selfies, group photos and at one point erupting in chants of “We won!”
Shortly after, Tarrio was arrested as live-streamers and journalists recorded police escorting him away.

Early education programs can’t access federal funding to pay bills,"Providers of the national program Head Start, which provides early-childhood education to children from ­low-income families, say that they cannot access the federal funds they need to keep the program running.
After the Trump administration’s executive order to pause some grants and loans disbursed by the federal government, providers couldn’t access the payment management system they use to request funds and get reimbursement. The White House Office of Management and Budget issued guidance Tuesday that the order was not supposed to impact programs such as Head Start, yet access to funding appears to have been frozen.
These funds — which must be spent within two days of when they are requested — are used to pay for everything from staff salary to utility bills, said Donna Davidson, president and CEO of Easter Seals North Georgia, a Head Start provider.
“If this doesn’t correct itself fairly quickly, we’re going to have to close,” Davidson said. “We are hoping that this was an error, but we’re already on Tuesday, payroll is on Friday. We have to be able to draw down that money to make payroll.”
Closing would mean that staffers, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck, would lose their income, and parents who rely on the program would need to figure out alternative child-care arrangements or stay home from work, Davidson said. So far, she said, providers have gotten no guidance from OMB or the federal Head Start agency offices on when access would be reinstated or what to do in the meantime.",True

Man who shot Black teen ringing wrong doorbell dies before sentencing,"An 86-year-old White man who was awaiting sentencing for his 2023 shooting of a Black teenager who accidentally rang his doorbell in Kansas City, Missouri, has died just days after pleading guilty, according to the local prosecutor’s office, in an abrupt end to a case that has outraged civil rights activists and further spurred national conversations about racism and U.S. gun policies.
Andrew Lester pleaded guilty <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/ralph-yarl-shooting-andrew-lester-missouri-c3ad936efab5feecc86f7928f730ec35"" target=""_blank"">this month</a> to second-degree assault, a charge that carries up to seven years in prison — a significantly lesser maximum sentence than the life in prison he faced when <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/17/ralph-yarl-shooting-kansas-city/"" target=""_blank"">he was charged</a> with first-degree felony assault and armed criminal action in April 2023.
On April 13 of that year, Lester shot 16-year-old honor roll student Ralph Yarl twice — including once in the head — through the glass front door of his home with a .32-caliber revolver. Yarl had rung his doorbell to pick up his 11-year-old twin brothers, who were actually at a residence a block away, at a similar-sounding address. He had never met the family of his brothers’ friends, nor had he been to their home.
Yarl <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/06/27/ralph-yarl-shooting-interview-gma/"" target=""_blank"">later recalled</a> his confusion and disbelief when he was waiting at Lester’s door and saw a man appear with a weapon.
“I hear the door open, I see this old man, and I’m assuming ‘Oh, this must be like their Grandpa,’” Yarl <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XscOmEBDFlw"" target=_blank>told ABC News</a> in June 2023. “And then he pulls out this gun.”
Yarl said he turned away from Lester, afraid but in disbelief that he would shoot. After he was shot, he fell to the ground and landed on shattered glass from the door before he ran away, screaming for help in the neighborhood. He later collapsed in another residence’s driveway.
“He only said five words: ‘Don’t come here ever again,’” Yarl recounted Lester saying. Lester <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/19/ralph-yarl-andrew-lester-shooting-black-fear/"" target=""_blank"">told police</a> that the two did not exchange any words before the attack.
The shooting <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/09/01/ralph-yarl-shooting-andrew-lester-trial/"" target=""_blank"">became another flash point</a> in conversations about racism and violence in the United States, with activists and rights groups again taking issue with “stand your ground” gun laws and their potential justification for the shooting of innocent Black men who are wrongly perceived as dangerous.
A Missouri self-defense law <a href=""https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=563.031"" target=""_blank"">states</a> that a person can shoot if the individual “reasonably believes that such deadly force is necessary” to protect “against death, serious physical injury, or any forcible felony.” Lester <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/06/27/ralph-yarl-shooting-interview-gma/"" target=""_blank"">had told police</a> that he was “scared to death” of Yarl.
Shortly after the incident, the Clay County prosecutor’s office <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/06/27/ralph-yarl-shooting-interview-gma/"" target=""_blank"">noted</a> that there was “a racial component” to the shooting. Several state lawmakers, clergy members and civil rights leaders also <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/18/andrew-lester-ralph-yarl-shooting/"" target=""_blank"">criticized</a> the Kansas City Police Department for taking several days to arrest Lester, who turned himself in less than 24 hours after prosecutors issued an arrest warrant.
The shooting <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOf8MCekqY8"" target=_blank>sparked protests</a> in Kansas City, and then-President Joe Biden <a href=""https://x.com/POTUS/status/1648390965797744640?s=20"" target=_blank>called Yarl</a>. In April 2023, Biden invited him to visit the White House.
“No parent should have to worry that their kid will be shot after ringing the wrong doorbell,” Biden had said on social media. “We’ve got to keep up the fight against gun violence.”
Lester’s cause of death was not released. He was scheduled to be sentenced March 7, according to Wednesday’s statement from Zachary Thompson, prosecuting attorney of Clay County.
In a statement posted to Instagram, Yarl’s family <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGRbbDCp2nf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" target=_blank>said</a> that Lester’s death “does not bring justice.”

Trump administration seeks more power to fire independent regulators,"The Trump administration has told Congress it is prepared to disavow a long-standing Supreme Court ruling that has preserved the independence of certain government agencies and protected commissioners from being fired without good reason.
The notice to lawmakers this week is another signal that the new president intends to make it easier to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/13/trump-firings-watchdogs/"" target=_blank>purge federal government workers</a> and exert maximum control over the bureaucracy. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has fired government agency watchdogs and officials who protect whistleblowers, in addition to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/28/trump-fire-eeoc-nlrb-board-members/"" target=_blank>members of the boards of<b> </b>three independent federal agencies</a> that oversee swaths of U.S. workers, employers and labor unions.
The board terminations appear to violate laws that protect certain agency leaders from being fired by the president<b> </b>without cause, potentially setting up a test of the boundaries of presidential power before the Supreme Court.
In a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) on Wednesday, the administration outlined its legal defense of the commissioner firings and appeared to be counting on a conservative Supreme Court <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/supreme-court-donald-trump-test-cases-presidential-authority/"" target=_blank>to be receptive to the president’s expansive views</a> of executive authority.
“The Department of Justice has determined that certain for-cause removal provisions that apply to members of multimember regulatory commissions are unconstitutional and that the Department will no longer defend their constitutionality,” acting solicitor general Sarah M. Harris wrote.
Such letters are<b> </b>required by Congress when the administration has decided not to defend a federal statute. It essentially put lawmakers<b> </b>on notice that<b> </b>the administration<b> </b>is willing to urge the justices to overturn the 1935 Supreme Court ruling in <i>Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S.</i>, which has protected members of regulatory agencies<b> </b>such as the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Trade Commission.
The Constitution gives the president the power to remove top executive branch officials for any reason at all, but Congress passed legislation that said those officials may not be fired without cause, an attempt to ensure their independence. The Trump administration’s position would give the president more control over those agencies and essentially treat their leaders more like Cabinet secretaries.
In response, Durbin said members of independent, bipartisan agencies such as the NLRB and FTC, which safeguard consumers and workers, have long been protected from removal at the whim of the president. The Trump administration’s push to overturn a nearly century-old Supreme Court precedent, he said in a statement, is a “striking reversal of the Justice Department’s long-standing position under Republican and Democratic presidents alike.”
The Trump administration’s move drew praise from conservatives such as Ed Whelan, a commentator and distinguished senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. He<b> </b>wrote in his newsletter Thursday that the administration is “rejecting — soundly, in my view — the notion that Congress may limit the president’s ability to remove principal officers of executive-branch agencies.”
But Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor and co-director of the school’s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, said the administration’s position amounted to a power grab with Trump wanting<b> </b>“to get rid of anyone who is not in his thrall.”
“He’s trying to turn the entire federal government into an episode of ‘The Apprentice,’ where he screams ‘You’re fired’ at everybody,” she said, making a reference to the president’s former<b> </b>reality TV show.
In late January, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/05/trump-lawsuit-nlrb-board-members-firing/"" target=_blank>Trump fired Gwynne Wilcox</a>, a Biden nominee on the NLRB whose term was set to expire in 2028. Wilcox filed a lawsuit alleging that her dismissal defied “Supreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies.”
The suit says that while Wilcox “has no desire to aid the President in establishing a test case,” she is also aware “of the fact that, if no challenge is made, the President will have effectively succeeded in rendering” invalid “the NLRB’s protections — and, by extension, that of other independent agencies.”
The NLRB — which oversees unionization votes by workers and adjudicates allegations of labor law violations — has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/21/musk-trump-nlrb-amazon-spacex/"" target=_blank>faced a flurry of legal challenges</a> to its constitutionality over the past year, including by SpaceX and Amazon (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post). Workers are already being affected by Wilcox’s firing, including a group of Philadelphia Whole Foods employees who voted to unionize the same day she was removed.
Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, objected to the union’s win on the grounds that, without Wilcox, the National Labor Relations Board lacks a quorum and therefore doesn’t have the authority to certify the election result. Legal experts said the argument is invalid.
In <i>Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S.</i>, the Supreme Court said Congress could stop the president from firing without good reason a member of the Federal Trade Commission. Specifically, the high court said President Franklin D. Roosevelt could not remove one of the FTC commissioners because of their political differences.
Ever since the Reagan administration, the conservative legal movement has advocated a robust view of presidential power known as the “unitary executive theory” in which the president controls all executive decisions without restraint from Congress. The theory played a role in 2020, when the court ruled 5-4 that the structure of another independent watchdog agency was unconstitutional and that the president could fire without cause the director of the <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-7_n6io.pdf"" target=_blank>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>.
That decision did not overrule the directive in <i>Humphrey’s Executor </i>that Congress can restrict the president’s power to fire officials at “multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power.”
But Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote separately to call for the ruling to be overturned, saying the precedent<b> </b>“poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people.”
It is not clear<b> </b>how many of the<b> </b>other justices would agree with Thomas and Gorsuch if given the opportunity in a future case.<b> </b>The court’s 6-3 conservative majority, with three justices nominated by Trump, last year overturned<b> </b>another long-standing ruling targeted by conservatives<b> </b>that required judges to defer to the reasonable interpretations of agency experts.
Gillian E. Metzger, a Columbia Law School professor who was deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel during the Biden administration, said recent rulings have created openings for presidents<b> </b>to try to increase their authority over agencies.
The Trump administration is “pushing to see how far they can get those to go,” she added, calling the departure from precedent that was signaled in the solicitor general’s letter part of a “very broad effort to hobble and denigrate core institutions of the federal government.”
In her letter to Congress, Harris mentioned three independent, multimember regulator agencies whose commissioners “exercise substantial executive power”: the National Labor Relations Board, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. She<b> </b>said the Supreme Court’s 1935 ruling “prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the Executive Branch who execute the laws on the President’s behalf.”
But the same rationale could apply to other agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. The Supreme Court, legal experts said, may be wary about calling into question the structure of the Federal Reserve, in particular, because of the potential destabilizing effects on monetary policy.
“Where would they draw the line?” asked Patrick Schmidt, a political science professor and co-director of legal studies at Macalester College.

Ed Dept DOGE team cancels $900 million in research contracts,"The Education Department on Monday shut down a large swath of work at the Institute of Educational Sciences, the arm of the department responsible for education research, by unilaterally cancelling at least 90 contracts worth $900 million. The agency is responsible for education research, evaluation of programs and collection of a vast amount of data about American schools.
The vast majority of the work of this agency is done by contractors, so canceling their work will have a significant impact on its ability to function, they said.
The canceled contracts were identified by a team of workers from the Department of Government Efficiency service, known as DOGE. The list includes some functions required by statutes.
Notices to contractors were sent Monday, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak. He said they were canceled “for convenience,” a provision that allows for a contract to be terminated without finding fault.
Madi Biedermann, spokeswoman for the department, said three popular programs run by the research arm of the agency were spared: the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a set of nationally representative tests to measure student progress over time, the College Scorecard and the College Navigator.
Biedermann said the canceled contracts would be rebid in hopes of getting the same or better work done at a lower cost. She said she did not know how or why DOGE concluded that these particular contractors are overpaid or underdelivering.
“The significant amount of money as compared to the outcomes generated for students is not commensurate,” she said. She said they are “looking for vendors to generate better outcomes for students.”
Asked how DOGE workers have the requisite expertise to make these determinations, she said, “The entire goal of DOGE is to cut waste, and they have been trained to identify that.”
Biedermann said 90 contracts worth $900 million were canceled. The second official said the list included 167 contracts.",True
Trump signs executive order seeking more death sentences,"President Donald Trump on Monday signed an <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-the-death-penalty-and-protecting-public-safety/"" target=""_blank"">executive order</a> directing the attorney general to seek the death penalty much more often and to encourage local and state prosecutors do to the same.
Trump also took aim at his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/12/23/biden-death-penalty-commutation/"" target=_blank>commuting the sentences</a> last month of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. Biden commuted their sentences to life in prison without parole. While Trump cannot undo those commutations, he raised the possibility that his administration could encourage local officials to seek new death sentences for them.
Writing in the order, Trump directed his attorney general to examine whether those people could be charged with state-level capital crimes and then “recommend appropriate action to state and local authorities.”
In addition to broadly requesting that the Justice Department seek more federal death sentences, Trump directed the attorney general to seek death “for every federal capital crime” in which a law enforcement officer is murdered or the defendant is in the country illegally.
During Trump’s first term, the Justice Department restarted executions and carried out 13, including some in the days leading up to Biden’s inauguration. Under Biden, the Justice Department imposed a moratorium blocking new executions, but prosecutors also continued to seek new death sentences.
Biden’s action commuting sentences last month left three men on federal death row: the surviving Boston Marathon bomber; the Charleston, South Carolina, church gunman; and the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman, who was prosecuted and sentenced to death during Biden’s term.
Trump has long been a vocal supporter of the death penalty. Capital punishment’s use nationwide has waned in recent decades, with executions and new death sentences plummeting. A Washington Post examination <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2024/death-row-inmates-us-executions/"" target=_blank>last year</a> found that many of the 2,100 people on death row appeared likely to die there without being executed.

Trump’s order also directs his attorney general to make sure that states with the death penalty have the necessary drugs for lethal injections.",True
Trump says new tariffs on computer chips are coming,"President Donald Trump said he would soon announce new tariffs on computer chips, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/07/raimondo-trump-chips-reckless/"" target=_blank>repeating a campaign promise</a> that if enacted could have deep impacts on the global tech industry and the geopolitical battle over AI with China.
Trump criticized the Biden administration’s policy of using taxpayer money to subsidize the construction of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing facilities and said that a tariff on importing computer chips would work better at forcing companies to move their factories to the United States.
“They’re not going to want to pay a 25, 50 or even 100 percent tax,” Trump said. “If you want to stop paying the taxes or the tariffs, you have to build your plant right here in America.”
Though the United States is the global leader in designing chips, the vast majority of chip production happens overseas, particularly in Taiwan, where the high-end computer chips necessary for training and running AI models are made.
<b>“</b>They left us and they went to Taiwan,” Trump said. “We want them to come back and we don’t want to give them billions of dollars.”
Trump also said the technical breakthroughs made by Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek should spur U.S. companies to compete harder to maintain the United States’ lead in artificial intelligence technology.
DeepSeek’s AI tech has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/27/deep-seek-ai-markets-nvidia/"" target=_blank>sent shock waves through Silicon Valley and Wall Street</a>, after the company claimed that its AI chatbot that rivals the capability of OpenAI’s ChatGPT cost just $6 million to train, a fraction of what top U.S. AI companies use to develop their programs.
“The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win because we have the greatest scientists in the world,” Trump said.
DeepSeek’s apparent breakthrough in making much more efficient AI could be a positive because the tech is now also available to U.S. companies, he said.",True

"Transgender troops will be removed from U.S. military, Pentagon says","Openly transgender service members will be disqualified from serving in the U.S. military and will soon be removed from<b> </b>the ranks, according to a Pentagon memo<b> </b>that marks a significant shift from previous Defense Department policy that prohibited discrimination based on gender identity.
The memo was made public Wednesday as part of a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/18/judge-trump-trans-troops-ban-animus/"" target=_blank>lawsuit filed by LGBTQ+ rights groups</a> against an <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/28/trump-transgender-troops-military-hegseth/"" target=_blank>executive order</a> signed last month by President Donald Trump, which stated that the “medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria” are “inconsistent” with the high standards expected of U.S. troops.
An earlier memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had said that people with a history of gender dysphoria would no longer be able to join the military but that they would be “treated with dignity and respect.” The new memo goes a step further in stating that current service members will be removed if they have gender dysphoria or a history of it.
The memo states that exceptions could be made for transgender service members who directly support “warfighting capabilities” if the government feels it has a “compelling” reason to retain them.
Rights group have decried the push to ban transgender troops and say transgender people have served in the military with distinction for years without issue.
SPARTA Pride, a rights group for transgender troops, said thousands of transgender people are serving in the military and are “fully qualified” for their positions. “No policy will ever erase transgender Americans’ contribution to history, warfighting, or military excellence,” the group said in a statement. “Transgender service members have a unique fighting spirit and will continue to defend the constitution and American Values no matter what lies ahead.”
The memo states that service members who are diagnosed with, have a history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria — a condition that involves feelings of psychological or physical discomfort tied to one’s gender identity — are disqualified from military service. Also disqualified are service members who have been treated for gender dysphoria with hormones or surgery.
The memo directs the secretaries of each branch to identify service members with gender dysphoria within 30 days and to “begin separation actions” within 30 days after that.
The affected service members will be honorably discharged as long as they meet normal conditions and qualify for involuntary separation pay, the memo states. If they voluntarily step down, they will be eligible to be paid twice as much under voluntary separation pay, it said.
The memo also states that the military will no longer pay for any treatments or surgery relating to service members’ gender dysphoria.
Even if a transgender service member obtains a waiver to stay in the military, they will face restrictions, the memo says. They cannot access “intimate spaces,” including changing rooms, bathrooms and showers, reserved for members of the gender they transitioned to. They will also have to meet the same physical<b> </b>standards as those of the sex they were assigned at birth, and their military records will be updated to reflect their sex assigned at birth.
About 4,200 service members have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to a senior defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Trump administration. That figure includes active-duty, reserve and National Guard personnel.
Between 2015 and 2024, the military spent about $52 million on transgender service members’<b> </b>psychotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery and other treatments, the senior defense official said. About 1,000 service members had transition-related surgeries during that period, while about 3,200 received hormone therapy, the official said.
Openly transgender people have been allowed to serve in the military since 2016, when the Obama administration <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/06/30/the-pentagons-ban-on-transgender-service-just-fell-but-the-details-are-complicated/"" target=_blank>repealed a ban on transgender service</a>, citing the value of ensuring that all qualified individuals were able to serve their country in uniform. Previously, the military considered transgender people to be unfit for service.
Obama had also, in 2011, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/military-certifies-repeal-of-dont-ask-policy/2011/07/22/gIQAye15TI_story.html"" target=""_blank"">repealed “don’t ask, don’t tell,”</a> a policy that prohibited openly gay service members from serving, and, in 2015, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/12/03/pentagon-chief-to-announce-how-womens-roles-in-the-military-will-expand/"" target=""_blank"">opened more combat roles to women</a>. In 2016, Rand published a <a href=""https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1530.html"" target=""_blank"">study</a> that found those changes in long-standing policy “had no significant effect on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness” and that concluded there was a “minimal likely impact on force readiness” from allowing openly transgender people to serve too.
In subsequent years, military leaders reported no significant harm from allowing openly transgender people to serve. In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2018, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley told Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) that he had “received precisely zero reports of issues of cohesion, discipline, morale” caused by integrating transgender service members.
During Trump’s first term, the Defense Department effectively prohibited transgender people from joining the military but allowed those already in uniform to stay on. The policy was challenged in court, but the Supreme Court <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-allows-trump-restrictions-on-transgender-troops-in-military-to-go-into-effect-as-legal-battle-continues/2019/01/22/e68a7284-1763-11e9-88fe-f9f77a3bcb6c_story.html"" target=""_blank"">upheld Trump’s partial ban in 2019</a>. The military <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/military-to-begin-enforcing-restrictions-on-trumps-transgender-troops/2019/03/13/cf2a0530-4587-11e9-9726-50f151ab44b9_story.html"" target=""_blank"">began enforcing that policy</a> later that year.
President Joe Biden quickly reversed Trump’s ban in an executive order after taking office in 2021.
Wednesday’s memo, which goes further than the policy implemented during Trump’s first term, was released as part of a <a href=""https://www.glad.org/cases/talbott-v-trump/"" target=_blank>lawsuit</a> filed by GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights on behalf of six transgender service members and two individuals seeking to enlist in the military. The suit alleges that Trump’s ban on transgender service members violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.
The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is considering a <a href=""https://www.glad.org/servicemembers-seek-immediate-block-of-transgender-military-ban/"" target=_blank>motion</a> to block enforcement of the ban until the outcome of the lawsuit is determined. The next hearing is scheduled for next month.",True

Who pays for Trump’s tariffs? It depends.,"Since taking office, President <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/"" target=_blank>Donald Trump</a> has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/26/trump-trade-war/"" target=_blank>threatened tariffs</a> on an array of trading partners, including Mexico, Canada, Europe, Colombia and India. He has instituted a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/09/china-tariffs-trade-war-united-states/"" target=_blank>10 percent tariff on Chinese goods</a> and a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/10/trump-tariffs-steel/"" target=_blank>25 percent tariff on aluminum and steel imports</a>.
Which nation ultimately bears the cost of a tariff depends on what that country makes and its pull in the global market. But economists warn that the added tax will largely fall on American businesses and consumers.

U.S. troops arrive at Guantánamo Bay in Trump migrant crackdown,"Infantry Marines and other U.S. troops have begun arriving at the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, U.S. military officials said Monday, in what is expected to be a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/29/guantanamo-cuba-el-salvador-deportations/"" target=_blank>significant operation to house migrants</a> until the Trump administration sends them to their home countries.
The deployments include members of 1st Battalion, 6th Marines, of Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, along with service members from U.S. Southern Command and U.S. Army North — headquarters units that will oversee aspects of the operation. The Defense Department disclosed the deployment Monday, after the White House posted Sunday morning that the Marines had begun arriving.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is due to travel to the southern U.S. border Monday, has said the Guantánamo facility will be useful to house migrants whose home country is not immediately assisting with return. They would be detained on a separate part of the base from where militants and terrorism suspects have long been held.
The Trump administration has said that up to 30,000 migrants could be held at Guantánamo. Migrants have been held there in the past, but in much smaller numbers.",True
You think you like puzzles? Wait until you see this house.,"The day Linda and Jeff Groskreutz stumbled upon a 4,600-square-foot ranch house with long empty walls in Madison Lake, Minnesota, they knew it was the one.
“It was perfect,” said Linda, explaining she was excited to finally buy a house with walls expansive enough to display the rewards of her longtime hobby: showstopping, large-scale jigsaw puzzles.
Since the couple moved in last May, they have turned their new basement into a massive jigsaw gallery, with supersized motifs such as sailboats, fish, planets, elephants, giraffes and tropical birds.

Linda, 67, said that she and Jeff moved from another nearby town in south-central Minnesota because they wanted to be near the lake. But, she added, the big walls were a great bonus.
The largest puzzles are showcased in plywood frames handmade by Jeff, who is supportive of his wife’s time-consuming and wall-consuming habit, though he does not puzzle himself.
“Linda is really good at what she does,” said Jeff, 69.
He’s hung a total of about 115,000 pieces in eight of his separate, sprawling frames. One puzzle is so long it spills onto two adjacent walls.
Then there’s the one Jeff calls “The Granddaddy” — a 40,320-piece creation emblazoned with various Disney movie themes. It weighs 44 pounds and measures more than 22 feet across and 6½ feet tall.
Each of the motifs from 10 Disney movies came in a different bag, and it took Linda 10 weeks to complete the whole thing.
“At the time, I didn’t have any wall space left, so it sat on cardboard in sections for several years,” she said. “Until I got a call one day from my minister.”
Her Lutheran pastor contacted her in 2021 and told her he was preparing a sermon series with a “fitting together” theme, and he wondered if she had a finished puzzle she could put on display at the church. Did she ever.
“I thought it would be a treat to see my Disney puzzle all together, so we took over each section of the puzzle in the truck and put it together across nine banquet tables,” Linda said. “It was there for everyone to look at for more than a week.”
Recently, her puzzles have had an even bigger audience since her husband shared a quick video walk-through of their basement on <a href=""https://youtu.be/o_wVMNIhplw?si=dRqpO1GcUZKcb8fV"" target=_blank>YouTube</a>.
“This is a little tour of what I like to call our puzzle room,” Jeff begins<b> </b>in the video. “This first puzzle is 24,000 pieces. We didn’t have enough wall space to put it all on one wall so we had to wrap it around the inside corner.”
He comments that Linda was the first person in Minnesota to complete that puzzle — which she did in 2008 — with a touch of help from family and friends. She is featured on <a href=""https://www.worldslargestpuzzle.com/hof2.html"" target=_blank>a hall-of-fame website for giant puzzle-solvers</a>, where she is quoted as saying: “I look forward to the next ‘World’s Largest Puzzle’ that I’m sure will come out in the future. My only problem being, that I have no more walls large enough to hold any more of them, so I would have to move.”
The next puzzle in the collection that Jeff features with his camera is a 5,000-piece puzzle of the twin towers in New York City. Linda put that one together right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Next are two animal scenes, each with 18,000 pieces. He then shows four others on the walls. Minnesota station <a href=""https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/land-of-10000-stories/minnesotan-buys-house-to-fit-massive-jigsaw-puzzle-collection/89-60be0703-b73a-4233-9fc8-fca700a92726"" target=_blank>KARE-11</a> recently picked up on the story.
Jeff ends his video with, “Well, thank you very much for coming on this little tour of mine.”
In her new house, Linda was thrilled that the Disney puzzle fit across the entire length of one wall, with just two inches to spare.<b> </b>Some of her family members — she has two children and three grandchildren — helped lift and install the heavy puzzle.
“Finally, I have room for it,” she said. “This is where it’s going to stay.”
Linda completes a 1,000-piece puzzle in five to seven hours, she said, and she never needs a magnifying glass.
“I’ve probably put together a couple thousand puzzles, but only the big ones get framed now and put up,” she said.
She has stacks of boxed puzzles neatly piled on a pair of five-story industrial metal shelves, as well as stray jigsaw puzzles scattered on tables nearby.
After she puts in the work to finish an extra large puzzle, she can’t bear to take her masterpieces apart. So she covers them <a href=""https://www.worldslargestpuzzle.com/hof-042.html"" target=_blank>with thin insulation plastic</a>, and Jeff builds the frames and hangs them — at least, the ones that fit on the walls.
“I don’t sleep well, so sometimes I’ll work [on a puzzle] until midnight, or I’ll occasionally get up at 2 or 3 and work on one,” Linda said.
She takes apart her favorite small puzzles and puts them back in their boxes so she can piece them together again months later. She said she is also a Sudoku puzzle fan, but adds she’d rather go fishing with her husband than tackle a crossword.
“I’ve always found doing puzzles relaxing, and I hope they help my brain,” said Linda, pointing out that puzzles <a href=""https://www.progresslifeline.org.uk/news/the-benefit-of-puzzles-for-the-brain"" target=_blank>help to improve short-term memory</a>.
She has been puzzling since she was 10 years old, growing up in rural Minnesota.
After she retired from her accounting job in 2018, she said she decided to devote more time to the hobby.
“My parents would give me and my siblings a new 1,000-piece puzzle for Christmas every year, and we’d all work on it together,” Linda recalled. “But what really got me going was when a relative from Germany came to visit in the late 1990s and learned that I loved puzzles.”
As a thank-you gesture for helping him to line up motel rooms for a cross-country trip, the relative sent her a 9,000-piece Tower of Babel jigsaw made by Germany’s famous <a href=""https://www.ravensburger.com/start/index.html"" target=_blank>Ravensburger puzzle company</a>.
“Then about four years later, he sent me an 18,000-piece, tropical jungle puzzle,” Linda said. “It took six months to put it together.”
To spread her love of puzzles, she recently started a <a href=""https://www.puzlib.com/default.php"" target=_blank>puzzle library</a> at a shopping center in nearby Mankato, where about 200 puzzles — many of them hers — are available for anyone to check out.
“It works like an honor system — you find the puzzle you want online, then you go pick it up, put it together and bring it back,” Linda said. “People have also contributed puzzles they don’t want anymore.”
She spends about 20 hours a week piecing together her creations. Her trick is to start with the edges, then fill in the pieces by color. She advises anyone tackling a large puzzle to use a room with good lighting and sort pieces into groups based on their shapes.
“If I didn’t donate a lot of my own puzzles, they’d quickly take over my house,” she said, guessing she has about 150 at home on her shelves.
When asked by a reporter about her latest jigsaw creation, she stifled a laugh through the phone.
“It’s a puzzle that shows a shelf with a bunch of spices,” Linda said. “I finished it while we were talking.”",False
Mexico extradites 29 drug suspects to U.S. as Trump threatens sanctions,"MEXICO CITY — Mexico extradited 29 alleged drug traffickers to the United States on Thursday, including Rafael Caro Quintero, a prized target long sought in the killing of a U.S. narcotics agent, and two leaders of the hyper-violent Zetas cartel, in a dramatic gesture apparently aimed at heading off crushing economic sanctions, according to U.S. officials.
President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on Mexico next week for what he calls its failure to stop drugs — especially fentanyl — from crossing the border. A high-level Mexican delegation met Thursday with senior Trump administration officials in an effort to hammer out a deal to avoid the economic penalties.
“Twenty-nine, that’s huge! What they’ve done is literally cleaned out the cupboard,” said John Feeley, a former U.S. diplomat who served as deputy chief of mission in Mexico from 2009 to 2012. Normally, he said, extraditions of major capos were handled one by one, often involving long negotiations. But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was “pulling out all the stops” to avoid the tariffs, he said.
The government <a href=""https://www.gob.mx/sspc/prensa/tarjeta-informativa-391650"" target=_blank>did not identify those extradited</a>. But the U.S. Justice Department said in a news release that  they included <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/07/23/mexico-drug-trafficker-caro-quintero/"" target=_blank>Caro Quintero</a>, who was long the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s most-wanted man. He was accused in the murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena in Mexico in 1985. Caro Quintero was freed from a Mexican prison on a technicality in 2013, to the outrage of DEA officials. After years of pursuing the drug lord, Mexican troops finally arrested him again in 2022.
Also sent to the United States were Miguel Ángel and Omar Treviño Morales, according to the DOJ statement.  Their Zetas cartel dominated much of central and northern Mexico starting around 2007. The group was dismantled a decade ago by the Mexican armed forces, but U.S. authorities alleged the brothers continued to run a Zetas offshoot,  the Northeast cartel, from a Mexican prison.
The DOJ release said Mexico carried out the extraditions in response to a recent decision by Trump to designate six Mexican cartels as terrorist groups. The Mexican government did not comment, beyond a brief statement saying the 29 people were sought “because of their ties to criminal organizations” involved in drug trafficking.

Vanda Felbab-Brown, a drug-policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, said the extraditions are “all part and parcel of the package the Mexican government is putting on the table to avoid the 25 percent tariffs.” Mexico also has been alarmed by suggestions from some Trump administration officials that U.S. military strikes should be carried out to weaken the cartels.
While the extraditions were welcome, the U.S. government should instead emphasize a broader demand for law enforcement to actively collaborate with Mexico in rounding up and dismantling criminal networks, Felbab-Brown said.

The Caro Quintero case has long been extremely sensitive for the DEA; U.S. officials at the highest levels had pressed Mexico to find and rearrest him after he managed to leave prison. He is accused of ordering the kidnapping of Camarena, allegedly as a punishment for the agent’s investigations. Camarena’s body was found on March 5, 1985, in a plastic bag on a remote Mexican ranch.
The murder was a central plotline of the Netflix series “Narcos, Mexico.”
Caro Quintero “has spent four decades atop DEA’s most wanted fugitive list,” said the agency’s acting administrator, Derek S. Maltz. “This moment is extremely personal for the men and women of DEA.”
Caro Quintero, 72, was being sent to New York, the  DOJ said. He faces charges of leading a criminal organization and participating in the kidnapping, torture and murder of Camarena. Prosecutors have accused his drug organization of sending tons of methamphetamines, cocaine and heroin from Mexico to the United States from 1980 to 2017.
The Treviño Morales brothers have been indicted in the District of Columbia on charges of “trafficking massive quantities of narcotics into the United States,” Nicole Argentieri, then-head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said in October.
The Zetas were originally formed as an armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. Many of the group’s early members were recruited from Mexican army special-forces troops. The group was known for its extreme cruelty — including beheading its enemies, killing Central American migrants it suspected of alliances with other groups and burning its enemies’ bodies in diesel-fueled fires.
<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-mexico-zetas-kingpins-arrest-is-display-of-new-restrained-style-in-drug-war/2013/07/16/5641c20a-ee32-11e2-bb32-725c8351a69e_story.html"" target=_blank>Miguel Ángel Morales</a>, in his early 50s, started out as a local gangster in the border town of Nuevo Laredo before joining the Zetas. He was known as Z-40. His younger brother, Omar, or Z-42, succeeded his brother as the Zetas leader following his arrest. Omar was himself detained in 2015.
Trump had initially said the penalties on Mexico and Canada would take effect in early February unless those countries drastically curbed the flow of migrants and illegal fentanyl over their borders with the United States. Mexico won a temporary reprieve by sending 10,000 extra National Guard forces to the border. But Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning that <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114076153524132682"" target=_blank>he intended to go ahead with the sanctions</a>.
“Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,” he wrote.
Fentanyl has set off the deadliest drug epidemic in U.S. history. But deaths from overdoses, and quantities of the opioid seized in the United States, have declined over the past year, officials say.

Trump orders sweeping review of federal regulations,"President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies Wednesday to review all of their regulations and cease enforcing those that do not conform to his political views, intensifying a sweeping deregulatory campaign that could eliminate many of the government’s rules on climate, education, health and labor protections.
The <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-lawful-governance-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-regulatory-initiative/"" target=""_blank"">new directive</a> tasked each federal agency to work with the U.S. DOGE Service — the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/14/doge-employees-list-staff-elon-musk/"" target=""_blank"">team of mostly young aides</a> assembled by tech billionaire Elon Musk — to identify all regulations that either carry high costs or do not seem in the White House’s eyes to be explicitly authorized by existing law.
Federal officials then must report back to the White House, its budget office and the Justice Department, in a process meant to inform efforts to “rescind or modify” the rules. Trump also set the stage for agencies to terminate any enforcement proceedings that seem to run counter to the administration’s beliefs on federal regulation or policy.
The White House mandate in some ways formalized a process that occurs at the start of every administration, as new leaders take office and look to shape the federal government to their liking. But Trump, in particular, has already exhibited great willingness to push the limits of presidential power to achieve his agenda — eliminating entire agencies, programs and funding streams, even those explicitly authorized by Congress, despite the objections of Democrats on Capitol Hill.
Some of the ideas resemble Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for his presidency prepared by the Heritage Foundation ahead of the 2024 elections. Its contributors include Russell Vought, who is set to play a critical role overseeing federal agencies as White House budget director.",True
Trump revokes security clearances for dozens of former national security officials,"Trump in an executive order on Monday directed the revocation of any active security clearances held by John Bolton, his former national security adviser, and the living signatories of a notorious October 2020 letter suggesting that emails purportedly taken from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden could be part of a “Russian information operation.”
The action all together targets 50 former national security officials, including several former directors of the Central Intelligence Agency. Some of the former officials no longer have security clearances, making the impact of the order unclear.
A Bolton representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations, served as Trump’s national security adviser for 17 months, ending in September 2019. In 2020, he published a memoir about his time in the administration that included damaging assessments of the president, portraying him as reckless and unfit for office.
In Monday’s order, Trump claimed that Bolton’s book was “rife with sensitive information drawn from his time in government,” an assertion that the former national security adviser has denied. The president has long assailed the signatories of the <a href=""https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000175-4393-d7aa-af77-579f9b330000"" target=_blank>October 2020 letter</a>, calling the statement a form of “election interference.”",True

Several administration officials tell workers not to reply to Musk email,"Elon Musk’s demand that all 2.3 million government workers<b> </b>justify their work prompted confusion and resistance on Sunday, as several government agency leaders told their staffs not to reply to a mass email requesting bullet-point summations of their accomplishments.
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard instructed personnel in U.S. spy agencies not to respond, according to the text of an email she sent to the workforce on Sunday, citing the agencies’ sensitive and classified work. Defense Department employees were given similar instructions to not respond, as were FBI personnel<b> </b>and Department of Homeland Security employees.
The latest directives<b> </b>come as employees and leaders alike across the government were caught off guard by an email sent Saturday titled: “What did you do last week?”
It commanded federal employees to “reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,” according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. It gave employees a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time Monday.
The email left many worried, others defiant and still others stunned. The resistance, which grew throughout the weekend, came even from some top administration officials selected by President Donald Trump.
Employees at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency were told definitively to reply — a few hours before DHS sent a note saying the opposite. In some parts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, staffers received instructions to draft a response but not send it yet. At other agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, employees were first given one instruction only to be emailed later to pause and watch for more guidance Monday.
Raising the stakes, Musk warned in a <a href=""https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893386883444437415"">post on X</a> that any employee who failed to respond would be treated as having resigned. But the email sent to workers made no mention of that possible consequence, which lawyers said would be illegal.
Musk’s threat also appears to contradict an <a href=""https://www.opm.gov/media/kfpozkad/gwes-pia.pdf"" target=_blank>assessment released on Feb. 5</a> by the Office of Personnel Management that concluded that any responses to government-wide emails must be “explicitly voluntary.” Yet the weekend email was sent by an address at OPM, which serves as human resources for the entire federal government — and has been largely taken over by Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service.
On Sunday, a Republican lawmaker questioned the viability of the directive.
“I don’t know how that’s necessarily feasible,” Rep. Michael Lawler (New York) said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Obviously, a lot of federal employees are under union contract.”
Many employees at certain agencies cannot disclose information about their work to third parties without explicit authorization, security experts noted. Some warned of security risks if all 2.3 million federal employees are forced to reply to one email server sharing their contact information, their manager’s contact information and details about the work they do.
Worries at intelligence agencies
Concerns ran especially deep among employees of the Defense Department, intelligence agencies and the military, according to messages and interviews with more than 300 federal employees.
“Even if people don’t send classified information, the aggregation of all this information in one place would become classified information, which is a national security violation,” warned one active-duty military officer who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “The military cannot function without the DOD federal workforce. This is a national security issue to treat the workforce this way.”
At the Justice Department, managers were advised late Saturday evening that all employees should be prepared to submit responses to the email on Monday. But rank-and-file FBI employees and staff in at least three U.S. attorney’s offices across the country said Sunday that the last guidance they received from their direct managers was not to reply to the email before receiving further instructions.
In a bureau-wide communication Saturday evening, newly installed FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI would “conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures.”
At the Secret Service, the OPM email prompted a flurry of texts and emails to supervisors among agents and officers about whether they were expected to reveal the sensitive and classified details of their job duties the previous week, according to two people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal communications.
To prevent agents from having to describe classified tasks they perform to protect the president and other high-ranking officials, senior officials initially instructed their subordinate agents to send an example response, beginning with: “This week I accomplished: 100% of the tasks and duties required of me by my position description” and “100% of the work product that my manager and I have agreed to.”
The fifth and final bullet said: “I exceeded expectations in the delivery of the above.”
On online forums, many employees cheered the boilerplate language, before DHS told staff early Sunday evening that no one should respond, including those in component offices such as the Secret Service.

At the State Department, Tibor P. Nagy, acting undersecretary of state for management, said in a message obtained by The Post the department “will respond on behalf of the Department,” adding that “no employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command.”
Similar messages went out to employees at a division within the Air Force, the Defense Information Systems Agency and the National Science Foundation, where the chief management officer said in a note to employees that the NSF did not receive advanced notice or guidance about the email.
Musk stands firm, as directive costs workers time
On Saturday night and throughout Sunday, Musk doubled down on the directive. On X, the social media platform he owns, he stated that the email was necessary to ferret out government employees who are “doing so little work that they are not checking their email.” He claimed, without evidence, that there were “non-existent people or the identities of dead people” pretending to be government workers. Many Republican lawmakers defended the message, arguing it would only take a few minutes to reply.
But it caused uncertainty — and ate up people’s time across the government. In the Air Force department, for example, some supervisors spent their Sundays phoning or texting each one of their subordinates to ensure they had seen both Musk’s email and later guidance saying not to reply to it, according to several employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.
The chaos extended beyond the executive branch. At the Library of Congress, which is part of the separate legislative branch, staff received an email Sunday afternoon saying the OPM note was not meant for them and they should not respond.
Some judges and judiciary staff, who are also not in the executive branch, also received the OPM email, according to a note obtained by The Post from the director’s office of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which staffs the judiciary branch. The message said no action should be taken and that the office would contact OPM about the Musk email.
Other workers and agencies were unsure if the email was real, given its unorthodox timing.
“It is possible that this new message sent outside of normal business hours was sent in error and/or is a phishing attempt,” said an email to some staff from NOAA leadership. “Until such time as we can verify that the message that was received … is authentic, please do not respond.”
The email also prompted defiance from Democrats and angry workers exhausted by Musk’s efforts.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) said in a statement Sunday that Democrats would block Musk in Congress and the courts.
“Elon Musk is traumatizing hardworking federal employees, their children and families,” Jeffries said. “He has no legal authority to make his latest demands.”
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) called the request “absurd” and defended government employees. “If Elon Musk truly wants to understand what federal workers accomplished over the past week, he should get to know each department and agency, and learn about the jobs he’s trying to cut.”
At least one staffer responded to the email with resistance. A worker with the U.S. Geological Survey forwarded the “What did you do last week?” email to his direct supervisors informing them he “categorically” refused to reply.
“There is no way that a team of people will read &gt;2 million responses to this message,” the employee wrote. “Anyone who replies is likely to have their responses fed into some AI woodchipper and used for goodness knows what purpose, legal or illegal.”
He then urged his bosses to defend their employees and “push back on these efforts to harass and intimidate us. We are all watching to see whose side you are on.”
Leaders within a NASA directorate advertised the email as a chance to tout workers’ accomplishments, writing that employees should reply with speed, accuracy and detail.
“In just the next two weeks we have 4 launches and 2 lunar landings with missions that will expand our understanding of the first stages of the Universe,” the NASA email stated. “Every one of you play key roles in these momentous endeavors … and can supply many more than just 5 accomplishments in any given week to showcase our mission.”
But at almost the same time elsewhere within NASA, another group of employees received opposite instructions.
One director wrote, “I recognize there are many concerns already being elevated around the request [including] data that would be sent un-encrypted. … The agency is asking employees to take a pause and wait for additional communication and guidance.”
And on Sunday morning, the NASA directorate that had urged employees to reply reversed its guidance. “Please go ahead and prepare your bullets but do not submit … until you receive further guidance,” a leader there wrote.

Migrants at border get message saying CBP One appointments ‘no longer valid’,"CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — Ridel Jiménez arrived at the border bridge leading into Texas before dawn Monday with his wife and their infant daughter, hoping to be allowed into the United States after fleeing Cuba.
They had waited six months in Mexico City for their appointment with U.S. immigration officials through <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2023/02/20/cbpone-boder-app-biden-migrants/"" target=_blank>CBP One</a>, the mobile app the Biden administration launched and that President Donald Trump’s team has vowed to eliminate.

Trump threatens tariffs on Russia if it doesn’t end Ukraine war,"President Donald Trump threatened Wednesday to “put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions” on Russia if does not reach a deal to end its war in Ukraine.
“Let’s get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with!” Trump <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113872782548137314"" target=_blank>wrote on his Truth Social platform</a>. “We can do it the easy way, or the hard way — and the easy is always better.”
Trump has been urging Russia for months to wind down the war, which started in 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Trump has a record of issuing tariff threats against countries in an effort to bend them to his will. After winning the November election, he threatened to put new fees on imported goods from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. But that did not happen Monday, and Trump <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/21/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada/"" target=_blank>has since suggested</a> he will issue those tariffs Feb. 1.
Trump’s posture toward Russia has been especially notable since he returned to the White House. Trump <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-ukraine.html"" target=_blank>issued an unusual critique</a> of the country’s president, Vladimir Putin, on Monday, saying he is “destroying Russia” by not making an agreement to end the war.
Russian imports to the United States have plummeted amid major U.S. sanctions on Russia over the war. One of President Joe Biden’s last moves in office was to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/10/russia-oil-sanctions-shadow-ships-biden/"" target=_blank>blacklist two of Russia’s largest oil producers</a> and nearly 200 tanker ships.

"DHS to end temporary protection for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem has decided to end temporary humanitarian protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans who sought refuge in the United States in the past few years, putting them at imminent risk of being forced to return to the autocratic regime they left behind in South America.
Noem wrote that conditions in Venezuela “no longer” met the criteria for its citizens to qualify for temporary protected status, which was set to expire in April for those who became eligible for it in 2023, according to a copy of the <a href=""https://washingtonpost.com/documents/cfb3c9b8-fff3-49eb-98dd-d2a3fcd9b891.pdf"" target=_blank>unpublished notice</a> that DHS released Sunday.
The Biden administration had extended their protections through the fall of 2026, citing extreme poverty and <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/10/el-salvador-temporary-protected-status/"" target=_blank>economic and political crises</a>. But the Trump administration quickly reversed that decision, and now the group that received temporary protection in 2023 could lose it 60 days after the notice is officially published in the Federal Register. Officials did not say when it could publish.
Noem also determined that allowing Venezuelans to live and work in the United States is “contrary to the national interest,” she said, citing gang activity — though criminals are generally ineligible for temporary protection — as well as the cost to cities such as New York to shelter migrants and other concerns.
Noem acknowledged that Venezuela is still struggling with many of the issues that the Biden administration raised, but she said there were “notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime.”
“In particular, the Secretary has determined it is contrary to the national interest to permit the covered Venezuelan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States,” the notice said. The New York Times first reported on the protection revocations.
Ending protections for Venezuelans is a marked shift for the Trump administration, which granted them reprieves from deportation during his first term, and Noem’s decision is expected to face legal challenges. Her announcement comes a day after President Donald Trump said <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/01/trump-venezuela-deportation-maduro-migrants/"" target=_blank>the government</a> of Nicolás Maduro would accept the return of Venezuelans.
Trump has vowed to carry out mass deportations and his administration launched with a blitz of immigration arrests nationwide. Trump officials emphasize that criminals are their top priority for removal but say that anyone in the United States illegally could be deported.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is on a tour of Latin America, lobbied intensively for the temporary protections as a U.S. senator, writing in 2022 that it would be a “very real death sentence” to force Venezuelans to return home.
Rubio referred questions to DHS last week after Noem reversed the Biden administration’s extension of protections for Venezuelans.
In one of the last acts of his first term, Trump granted <a href=""https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferred-enforced-departure-certain-venezuelans/"" target=_blank>Venezuelans</a> permission to stay in the United States because of the “catastrophic” conditions in their homeland.
Political support for Venezuelans waned, however, after the slaying last year of a Georgia nursing student by a man from Venezuela with a criminal history, including shoplifting.
A House investigation into the man’s immigration status found that he had crossed the border illegally and sought <a href=""https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/08-16-2024-The-Case-of-the-Illegal-Alien-Who-Murdered-Laken-Riley.pdf"" target=_blank>asylum</a>, but it did not find that he had temporary protected status.<b> </b>Trump repeatedly referred to the murder on the campaign trail and he recently signed into law the Laken Riley Act, expanding mandatory detention for immigrants arrested for theft-related crimes.
Human rights organizations, immigration lawyers and politicians condemned Noem’s decision Sunday, given the continuing emergencies in Venezuela, including shortages of food, water and electricity, and political crackdowns against Maduro opponents.
“There is bipartisan agreement that TPS recipients from Venezuela shouldn’t be forced to return to extremely dangerous conditions,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada) said in a statement Sunday. “Nothing about Venezuela’s communist regime has changed since 2023, and taking away these protections for hardworking families doesn’t make our country any safer.”

Wilfredo Allen, a South Florida immigration attorney, said Noem’s decision was “shocking” given that Trump withdrew diplomatic personnel from Venezuela in 2019 and has maintained sanctions against the country.
Ahilan Arulanantham, a UCLA law professor who led the lawsuit that blocked Trump from terminating protections for Haitians and other groups during his first term, said Noem’s actions are “plainly illegal.”
Venezuelans are the largest group by far in the United States with temporary protected status, a humanitarian program created under a 1990 law for people from countries destabilized by war, a natural disaster or another emergency.
Soon before he left office, President Joe Biden’s Department of Homeland Security secretary, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/02/05/alejandro-mayorkas-impeachment-and-border-legacy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4"" target=_blank>Alejandro Mayorkas</a>, extended protections for up to 600,000 Venezuelans through <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/10/el-salvador-temporary-protected-status/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4"" target=_blank>October 2026</a>.
He had granted them temporary protected status in 2021 and 2023. The 2023 group’s protections were set to expire April 2, while the 2021 group’s status will expire Sept. 10.
Critics of the TPS program have long argued that repeat extensions flout the temporary intent of the law. Most of those who apply don’t otherwise qualify for legal status, and on his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order saying that the program should be “limited in scope.”
Immigrants from 17 countries have the protection, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the program. Before he left office, Mayorkas expanded protections for about 85 percent of those enrolled in the program, including<b> </b>El Salvador, <a href=""https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/01/10/dhs-extend-temporary-protected-status-ukraine"" target=_blank>Ukraine</a> and Sudan.
Protections for other countries, such as Honduras, are set to expire in the coming months.

In her analysis, Noem said TPS allowed a “significant population” of Venezuelans with no clear path to<b> </b>a<b> </b>lawful immigration status into the United States, and said extending temporary protections could encourage more to arrive.
Abby Maxman, president and chief executive of Oxfam America, said TPS recipients are already integrated into communities across the United States, and needed to work in health care, construction and farming.
“Revoking TPS is not only inhumane but also economically disastrous,” she said in a statement, calling the move “a direct attack on families and communities who have sought safety and stability in the United States.”

"Personnel forms vanish from government database, emails obtained by The Post show","Crucial personnel forms vanished from a government database across multiple federal agencies Thursday, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post and people with knowledge of the development.
The forms, known as SF-50s, detail critical job information such as titles, salaries, employment history and personal information, including Social Security numbers. Typically, federal employees can access such forms in a database maintained by the Office of Personnel Management, the human resources arm of the U.S. government.

Supreme Court grants Trump request to pause USAID payments order,"Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. granted the Trump administration’s request late Wednesday to pause a lower court’s midnight deadline for the government to resume nearly $2 billion in foreign aid payments suspended for weeks.
The brief administrative order, which did not address the underlying legal issues, will allow time for a full Supreme Court review.
U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali had given the administration until 11:59 p.m. to fulfill its contractual obligations and restart the payments to organizations whose work in impoverished parts of the world had been stopped since President Donald Trump halted such foreign assistance in late January.
Acting solicitor general Sarah M. Harris, the government’s top appellate lawyer, had <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25546029-24a831/"" target=_blank>asked the Supreme Court to block Ali’s order</a>, which she said had “thrown what should be an orderly review by the government into chaos.”
The lower-court order, Harris wrote, exceeds the judiciary’s authority. The government is “committed to paying legitimate claims for work that was properly completed,” she added. “What the government cannot do is pay arbitrarily determined demands on an arbitrary timeline of the district court’s choosing.”
Roberts gave the global aid organizations challenging the administration’s actions until noon Friday to respond to those assertions.
The request to the Supreme Court marked the second time the new administration has asked the justices to intervene after a lower-court judge blocked Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government. Last week, the high court <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/21/trump-dellinger-fire-supreme-court/"" target=_blank>refused to immediately clear the way</a> for the removal of Hampton Dellinger, the head of an independent watchdog agency, whom Trump tried to fire.
Trump issued the wide-ranging pause on foreign aid shortly after his inauguration. His allies quickly began dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, the $40 billion arm of the government that assists humanitarian work in more than 100 countries. The moves <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/"" target=""_blank"">left millions of people at risk of hunger and illness</a> and thousands of USAID employees without jobs, some stranded in dangerous places around the world.
Two groups — the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council — filed suit. On Feb. 13, Ali, a Biden appointee who has been on the bench only since December, issued a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/14/usaid-trump-farmers-food-for-peace-kansas/"" target=_blank>temporary restraining order</a> prohibiting the administration from stopping the aid payments.
But in the days that followed, advocates alleged in court, administration officials openly defied the order, continued to lay off thousands of staffers and contractors, and started terminating thousands of grants that did not fit the administration’s “America First” agenda.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio had earlier exempted some of the relief programs from the pause for work deemed “lifesaving.” But a key payment system has remained largely offline, which has left aid partners without enough cash to continue their work and stranded thousands of pounds of food and medicine far from the communities desperate for help.
On Tuesday, Ali gave officials his deadline for restarting payments. The Trump administration immediately appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, saying that disbursing nearly $2 billion payments would take weeks.
Three hours before Ali’s deadline, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit<a href=""https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/orders/docs/2025/02/25-5046LDSD.pdf"" target=_blank> turned away</a> the administration’s request, saying it does not have the right to appeal at this early stage of the litigation before the U.S. district judge has finished his work.
At that point, the solicitor general’s office had already asked the Supreme Court to intervene.
Harris told the justices that the government cannot function and the president cannot carry out his duties over foreign affairs if “a district court can appoint itself the claims-processor for the federal government and second-guess the Executive Branch’s determinations.”
On Wednesday, the plaintiffs alleged that a small number of Trump’s political appointees, acting at the direction of Trump adviser Elon Musk, were refusing to authorize or vetoing the back payments to foreign aid.
A Trump administration official said via email Wednesday evening that the State Department and USAID had just completed a review of its programming, identifying nearly $4.4 billion in grants for elimination. Nearly 5,800 awards were targeted for elimination as part of “the America First agenda,” the official said.
USAID retained critical awards, including food assistance, lifesaving medical treatments for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, and support for nations like Lebanon, Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba, the official said.
The review had been ongoing when Ali “intervened” in the process, the official added, and the State Department and USAID moved “rapidly to complete the programmatic evaluation,” lifting stop-work orders for some programs and terminating others.
Aid groups and contractors told The Washington Post on Wednesday that they were receiving government notices of thousands of aid projects being terminated, despite the federal judge’s ruling that foreign assistance should continue.

Trump’s Mideast envoy tries to explain what president was talking about,"President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, deployed to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to help back away from Trump’s Tuesday night proposal to seize control of the Gaza Strip and displace its population after some Republicans raised objections about a new U.S. military occupation overseas.
“Witkoff said that the president doesn’t want to put any troops in Gaza and that he doesn’t want to spend any U.S. money on Gaza,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) said after Witkoff delivered a presentation to Senate Republicans over a private lunch meeting. “Which is good,” Hawley added. “So maybe, I might have misunderstood the president last night.”
But Witkoff did not suggest that Trump had abandoned his proposal that Gaza’s population of 2.2 million Palestinians be displaced.
Witkoff “painted a scenario of a Gazan family moving back into tents, thinking, ‘I’m going to get back into a dwelling in five years,’ and that is just not going to happen. It is a wasteland of rubble,” said one senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe Witkoff’s private presentation. Arab states — who have so far reacted in anger to Trump’s remarks — would have to take the Palestinians, Witkoff told them.
How? Money. The senator said other Arab governments could be enticed with the offer of treaties and deals that would provide “hundreds of billions of dollars to their economy” in exchange for resettling the Palestinians.
“It’s clear to me the administration believes there’s a win-win situation with some Arab countries, where it would become so financially attractive to them to accept these displaced Gazans,” the senator said. “There are reconstruction and construction and development projects that are not eligible for adequate insurance under the current constraints that Saudi Arabia has, for example, that would be lifted if certain agreements could be made or consummated.”
Hawley said that one senator asked Witkoff if perhaps Trump was just speaking off the cuff, tossing out ideas as they came to him, as he sometimes does.
Witkoff assured them it wasn’t that either — Trump has been “gestating on this plan for some time,” Hawley said, describing the exchange. He didn’t provide many further details on what the plan was though.

Treasury agrees to block DOGE’s access to personal taxpayer data at IRS,"The Trump White House<b> </b>and Treasury Department officials have agreed to prohibit the U.S. DOGE Service from accessing personal taxpayer data, according to two people familiar with the arrangement, heading off a brewing privacy<b> </b>crisis at the tax agency.
Gavin Kliger, a software engineer with Elon Musk’s DOGE effort assigned to the IRS, will have read-only access to anonymized tax data, the same access granted to academic researchers and IT professionals who work on IRS systems, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details of the agreement.
DOGE, which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, over the weekend requested broad access to the most sensitive IRS data systems, which would have given Kliger the ability to see and in some cases edit detailed information — including bank accounts, payment balances, Social Security and other personal identification numbers and, in some instances, medical information — on virtually every individual, business and nonprofit in the country.
White House officials argued that access was necessary to fulfill DOGE’s charge of rooting out government waste. But that information is some of the most heavily guarded data in the federal government. Political officials do not have access to the Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS. The IRS’s commissioner, national taxpayer advocate and even senior officials in the office of the chief information officer do not have IDRS access either.
The IRS was prepared to reject the White House’s request, the people said, on the grounds that allowing DOGE to have the information would put millions of taxpayers’ information at risk. But over the course of the week, Treasury officials recognized the broad nature of DOGE’s request and agreed to limit Kliger’s access, the people said.
Representatives for the White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
DOGE has sought entry to several highly sensitive data systems across the government. The group sought access to the Treasury Department’s payment systems; the career official who was in charge of that program resigned rather than grant the request. He was later replaced by a DOGE staffer on assignment to Treasury.
DOGE is also attempting to gain access to Social Security Administration datasets, which include the world’s largest repository of medical data and years of history on social safety net payments and employment histories. The acting Social Security administrator resigned late last week after clashing with DOGE officials over that request.",True

Trump curbs enforcement of foreign antibribery law,"President Donald Trump directed the Justice Department on Monday to relax enforcement of a law used to prosecute U.S. companies who bribe foreign officials, saying it has put American business at a competitive disadvantage while operating abroad.
In an executive order, the president instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to pause actions taken under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act until the Justice Department can draft new guidance that “promotes American competitiveness and efficient use of federal law enforcement resources.”
A fact sheet the White House distributed along with the order asserted that the law had long harmed U.S. companies through “overenforcement because they are prohibited from engaging in practices common among international competitors, creating an uneven playing field.”
Enacted in 1977, the FCPA bars American businesses or their representatives from offering money or gifts to foreign officials to win business overseas. Since then, large corporations, including Lockheed Martin, Goldman Sachs, Haliburton, Chiquita, Goodyear and Daimler AG, have at points all run afoul of the statute, agreeing to multimillion-dollar settlement deals to resolve allegations that they’d provided illegal enticements to foreign leaders.
Trump’s antipathy toward the FCPA predates his time in the White House. <a href=""http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000089630&play=1"" target=_blank>In a 2012 appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,”</a> he called the statute “ridiculous” and a “horrible law.”
“Every other country in the world is doing it,” he said. “We’re not allowed to do so. It puts us at a huge disadvantage.”
Trump publicly floated the idea of restricting enforcement during his first term but ultimately took no action. Even before his executive order Monday, Bondi had moved to narrow the Justice Department’s pursuit of foreign antibribery cases.
Within hours of being sworn in as attorney general last week, she issued a directive instructing prosecutors to prioritize FCPA cases “related to foreign bribery that facilitates criminal operations of [drug and human smuggling] cartels” and “shift away from investigations that do not involve such a connection.”",False

Democrats vow political consequences amid House budget drama
House Republicans weathered a nail-biter of a vote last night and passed a budget blueprint that lets them get down to work on President <b>Donald Trump</b>’s agenda.
It was not without political danger — to put it mildly.
“We just won back the House,” Rep. <b>Haley Stevens</b> (D-Michigan) said as she walked off the floor.
In approving the budget resolution with only one defector — Rep. <b>Thomas Massie</b> (R-Kentucky) — House Speaker <b>Mike Johnson </b>(R-Louisiana) was able to assuage the concerns of more moderate Republicans that the proposal laid the groundwork for devastating cuts to Medicaid and other programs.
But even days before the 217 to 215 vote, the political peril was becoming evident for House Republicans. Nearly half the federal spending cuts proposed in the resolution would come through the House committee that oversees Medicaid, and Democrats argued that cuts to the program were all but inevitable.
Democratic-aligned groups released reams of polling and data on Medicaid, breaking it down by congressional district in some cases.
The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, <a href=""https://www.americanprogressaction.org/article/these-15-congressional-districts-would-see-large-medicaid-funding-losses-under-republican-house-budget-resolution/"" target=""_blank"">released a list of 15 GOP-held districts</a> that it said would see “large” Medicaid losses if the House Energy and Commerce Committee fully cut from Medicaid under the budget blueprint. Many of those districts are represented by some of the most vulnerable House Republicans.
The pushback illustrated Democratic confidence that even though the midterms are well over a year away, messing with Medicaid could be politically fatal for the GOP.
In a memo released Monday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee argued that vulnerable House Republicans would be “sealing their political fate” by supporting the budget resolution. The DCCC reiterated the sentiment after the vote, saying in a statement on Republicans’ support for the resolution that “no amount of their desperate lies will save them from the political fallout of this vote.”
Some House Republicans in competitive districts raced to explain their vote within minutes of the resolution’s approval.
“The Budget Resolution passed today does not specify any cuts to federal programs,” Rep. <b>Ken Calvert</b> (R-California) said in a statement, without mentioning Medicaid by name. “I want to make it clear that I do not support cuts to Social Security, Medicare and the safety net programs our vulnerable Americans rely on.”
The House GOP campaign arm went on offense after the vote by focusing on how the resolution sets the stage for the extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. The National Republican Congressional Committee argued that vulnerable House Democrats had just voted to “raise taxes on MILLIONS of American families and small businesses.”
But it was House GOP leaders who spent yesterday trying to unify their conference behind the budget resolution, looking to quash reservations — or outright opposition — from the center and the right.
“The word ‘Medicaid’ is not even in this bill,” House Majority Leader <b>Steve Scalise</b> (R-Louisiana) said yesterday at a news conference, holding up the budget resolution and pointing at it. “This bill doesn’t even mention the word ‘Medicaid’ a single time, and yet all Democrats are doing is lying about what’s in the budget because they don’t want to talk about the truth of what we’re voting to start. We’re voting to start a process. This doesn’t end the process.”
“Clearly we’ve hit a nerve,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman <b>Pete Aguilar</b> (California) told reporters a short time later.
Privately, many House Republicans tell our colleague <b>Marianna Sotomayor</b> that drafting policies to match the strict spending levels will result in cuts and that Democrats are not “fearmongering,” as GOP leaders alleged yesterday, that cuts would affect social benefits such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Rep. <b>Juan Ciscomani </b>(R-Arizona), who was part of a group of Hispanic Republicans that had raised concerns about potential Medicaid cuts, told reporters hours before the vote that GOP leaders were hearing him out.
“The Hispanic community, along with the rest of the country, trusted us with this mandate,” Ciscomani said, “and they want us to rein in the government spending, and they also want to make sure that their loved ones are protected with health insurance.”
Another vulnerable House Republican — Rep. <b>Michael Lawler</b> (New York) — echoed Scalise hours before the vote.
“The budget resolution is simply about unlocking the ability to negotiate a bill,” Lawler told reporters. “That’s ultimately what today is about. The Democrats will try to make it about all sorts of things, but show me where in the budget resolution it talks about specific cuts. It doesn’t.”
While it’s early in the cycle, some of the Democratic challengers who have already launched campaigns against vulnerable House Republicans released statements yesterday adding to the pressure on them. One of those challengers was <b>Rebecca Bennett</b>, a former Navy helicopter pilot who’s running against Rep. <b>Tom Kean Jr. </b>(R-New Jersey).
“It’s time for Congressman Kean to show residents of the 7th District where he stands on this critical issue — will he vote to protect the health care of thousands of families and children?” Bennett said in a statement. “That should be an easy decision.”
Kean’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.
What’s next? The House and Senate have passed different proposals to craft Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” so both sides must deconflict and pass the same budget resolution to start putting policy to paper.

Elon Musk joins Trump’s first Cabinet meeting
Trump is set to hold his first Cabinet meeting today with<b> </b>a special guest: <b>Elon Musk</b>.
White House press secretary <b>Karoline Leavitt </b>told reporters yesterday that Musk, head of the U.S. DOGE Service, will attend the meeting to “talk about DOGE’s efforts and how all of the Cabinet secretaries are identifying waste, fraud and abuse in their respective agencies.”
It will serve as another reminder of the extraordinary — and controversial — role that Musk is playing in the Trump administration. And it will come after some Cabinet secretaries urged their employees not to respond to a recent email from Musk telling them to share what they worked on in the past week.
Leavitt said Trump respected the decisions of those Cabinet secretaries but downplayed any tensions. Trump, Musk and the secretaries are “working as one team,” she said.

Donalds announces Florida gubernatorial campaign
Rep. <b>Byron Donalds</b> (R-Florida) made it official last night: He’s running for Florida governor.
He announced the move on Fox News days after Trump endorsed him, instantly making him a formidable candidate to succeed term-limited Gov. <b>Ron DeSantis</b> (R) in the 2026 election.
DeSantis made clear Monday he is not on board with Donalds, criticizing him as absent from recent conservative victories in Florida. DeSantis also talked up his wife, <b>Casey DeSantis</b>, as a possible gubernatorial candidate.
Asked about her potential candidacy on Fox, Donalds said it’s “very early” and “we’ll see what happens” — but he was quick to emphasize he has Trump’s endorsement. As for Ron DeSantis, Donalds said the governor has done “a tremendous job” and then offered an implicit response to DeSantis’s recent criticism.
“For a long time, I’ve been in the trenches of a lot of these battles dealing with conservatism,” Donalds said, referring to his time as a state legislator.

Elon Musk urges far-right German party to move beyond ‘past guilt’,"Greeted with loud cheers, Elon Musk virtually delivered a short speech Saturday at a rally for the far-right<b> </b>Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, where he urged the crowd to not be ashamed of their country’s history.
Musk’s appearance comes amid debate over whether<b> </b>a gesture he made<b> </b>twice during<b> </b>an inauguration rally was a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/21/elon-musk-salute-trump-inauguration/"" target=_blank>Nazi-style salute</a>, which he denies.

At the rally in Halle, Musk encouraged the roughly 4,500 attendees to be proud of their German heritage.
“There is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that. Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great-grandparents,” Musk said, seeming to reference the country’s history when the Nazis rose to power.
“You should be optimistic and excited about a future for Germany,” said Musk, as the crowd applauded.

The SpaceX CEO reiterated his praise for AfD, telling supporters, “I think you’re the best hope for Germany.”
Weidel thanked Musk for his support after his remarks and said, “Make Germany great again!” echoing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again”  slogan.
The same day, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/25/germany-afd-protests-farright-elections/ff7f47e6-db3f-11ef-85a9-331436ec61e9_story.html"" target=_blank>protesters</a> took to the streets in Berlin and Cologne, singing anti-fascist songs and denouncing the AfD.
“Those who fuel racism and attack climate protection are not just campaigning, they are endangering lives,” Luisa Neubauer, a climate activist, told the crowd, according to the Associated Press. Police say about 35,000 protesters showed up in Berlin, while the Cologne rally had about 40,000 attendees.
AfD is considered by Germany’s <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/13/germany-afd-extremist-party-court/"" target=_blank>domestic intelligence service to be a suspected extremist organization</a>.

Asked about Musk’s comments Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) told CNN’s “State of the Union” that he does not believe Musk is a Nazi, “but what he said does bother me in this regard.”
“Tomorrow is the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/25/auschwitz-nazi-germany-oswiecim-anniversary/0729859e-dada-11ef-85a9-331436ec61e9_story.html"" target=_blank>80th anniversary of liberating Auschwitz</a>,” Graham said. “I was just there a few months ago. You know, I don’t expect the Germans to be, racked with collective guilt all their lives. But I do hope in German schools they educate the German children about what happened in Germany. I hope in our schools that we’ll educate people.”

Musk <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/20/elon-musk-afd-germany/"" target=_blank>backed the AfD in late December</a>, drawing a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/30/musk-germany-far-right-afd-welt-op-ed/"" target=_blank>harsh rebuke from the German government</a> with accusations that the tech mogul was “trying to influence the federal election.” The election is  set for Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally scheduled after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/16/olaf-scholz-confidence-vote-germany-election/"" target=_blank>lost<b> </b>a vote of confidence</a> in mid-December.

"With Gaza rule at stake, Palestinian forces struggle to make their case","JENIN, West Bank — The Palestinian Authority recently took a high-stakes gamble in this restive city, launching a major military operation aimed at clipping the wings of militant groups that had grown in influence and audacity.
If the operation succeeded, Palestinian security forces would demonstrate they could maintain order not only in the parts of the West Bank they nominally control but also, if given the chance, perhaps in Gaza as well. The role of the Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza is very much a live question as foreign powers and Arab states now debate the future of the war-torn enclave.
But the six-week campaign in Jenin, which lost momentum after Israeli forces intervened last month, ultimately came up badly short and exposed some of the challenges the authority would face in securing Gaza. While the security forces arrested dozens of Iranian-backed fighters, high-profile militants remain at large.
The clashes highlighted how poorly equipped the Palestinian Authority security forces are compared with the groups they are seeking to subdue. The campaign also underlined questions about how far Palestinians would go to fight fellow Palestinians and whether the authority could maintain its popular legitimacy if it did so. Moreover, the events in Jenin revealed how Israel’s actions, which include its own withering attacks<b> </b>on targets in the city, undermine the ability of the Palestinian Authority to exert its control.
The battle between the Palestinian security forces and an umbrella group of fighters in Jenin led by Palestinian Islamic Jihad left 15 dead, including at least six civilians, and dozens injured, a spokesman for the authority’s forces said.
The questions raised about the Palestinian Authority’s ability to rule come as governments in the region are racing by the end of this month to present a counterproposal to President Donald Trump’s proposal to displace all of the Gaza Strip’s 2.2 million inhabitants. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there must be no role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, an alternative Arab plan, expected in the coming weeks, is certain to give the authority a central role, despite profound concerns about its capabilities.
The Jenin operation “demonstrated the limits of the PA security forces,” said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “If you cannot succeed decisively in an operation like Jenin, how can you hope to tackle the infinitely more complex situation in Gaza?”
Firepower put to the test
The Jenin campaign was the biggest test so far of the Palestinian Authority forces, which are responsible for security control in the West Bank’s major Palestinian population centers under the terms of the peace deal reached with Israel in the 1990s.
The forces include about 35,000 members and coordinate security and share intelligence with Israel, which continues to occupy the West Bank. The U.S. government has given Palestinian security forces about $1.1 billion since 2007, State Department officials said last year, and has supervised their training in Jordan. The Trump administration has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/19/trump-aid-freeze-palestinian-authority-israel/"" target=_blank>stopped all funding to the Palestinian Authority security forces</a> as part of the global freeze on foreign assistance, according to U.S. and Palestinian officials.
At a news conference last month and in an interview last week, Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, spokesman for the security forces, outlined what he said were the accomplishments of the Jenin operation: Hundreds of militants and accomplices arrested. Illicit funds, explosives and weapons seized. Improvised bombs that had been planted in neighborhoods — meant, the militants said, to target Israeli soldiers — were defused.
“The security services have the ability and readiness to deal with the situation in Gaza,” Rajab said in the interview.
But Jenin residents, Israeli officials and analysts have panned the operation.
“If the end result is that everybody in the world — and especially the U.S. and the Arab countries — see that the PA can’t get control of 100 militants in Jenin, how can they secure Gaza?” said Mairav Zonszein, senior Israel analyst at the International Crisis Group.
After laying siege for about six weeks to the Jenin refugee camp, which is adjacent to the city, Palestinian security forces remained unable to penetrate its maze of narrow alleys. When Washington Post journalists visited the camp on two occasions in mid-January, armed militants strolled the streets while scouts with walkie-talkies stood watch on rooftops, unbothered by sporadic bursts of gunfire from security forces on the mountain above.
The operation was taxing for the residents of the camp. But compared with raids by the Israeli troops, for the militants, it was “a break, a vacation,” said Jihad, a senior member of the Jenin Battalion, the umbrella group of militants. Like some others interviewed for this story, Jihad gave only his first name out of fear of retribution.
The Jenin Battalion is better armed than the security forces, according to Tahani Mustafa, Crisis Group’s senior analyst for the Palestinian territories. Many have M-16 rifles smuggled in from Jordan or bought from weapons traffickers in Israel, Jihad said. The authority’s forces, in contrast, carry old Kalashnikov rifles. Israel has barred the Palestinian security forces from importing better weapons, ammunition and light armored vehicles.
In early January, the militants demonstrated their continued capabilities by shooting dead three Israelis driving through Funduq, a village outside the city. The Jenin Battalion claimed responsibility. Then, Jihad said, the gunmen slipped undetected back into the camp to take refuge.
The attack “was first a message to the PA, because they are besieging us, but that won’t end our resistance against the occupation,” he said.
Contrary to the authority’s claims, Jihad said that only a handful of those arrested by the middle of last month were members of the battalion and that only one militant fighter had been killed by the security forces. Two other victims were unaffiliated teenagers.
The authority’s forces, meanwhile, lost six members. Many others sustained injuries, a colonel who directs training at the authority’s Central Training Institute for security forces said, speaking on the condition of anonymity according to his office’s protocol.
During a recent assessment of the operation, Palestinian security leaders concluded their forces had fallen short in hitting targets, engaging in close-quarters gun battles and dismantling improvised explosive devices, the colonel said. “Our men have very basic experience and don’t have protective gear, and the situation for them was very hard,” he added.
Loyalty put to the test
Violence among Palestinian factions is hardly unprecedented. A bloody battle in Gaza in 2007 between Hamas and the Fatah party, which controls the Palestinian Authority, left dozens dead and culminated in the authority’s ouster from the enclave. But for years, the internecine fighting had not reached the level recently seen in Jenin.
The military campaign this winter tested the loyalties of some authority security officers, raising questions about their willingness to turn their guns on other Palestinians. In one widely shared video, an officer from Jenin camp, Mustafa al-Qaniri, publicly resigned in protest. (His son, Ibrahim, whom Hamas claimed as a member, was later killed in an Israeli airstrike.)
Palestinian Authority security personnel once commanded more respect in Palestinian society. It was “a good job with a good salary,” said a woman in Jenin named Alaa, whose husband signed on with the force more than a decade ago. But when he received orders in December to deploy in Jenin, he refused. “If he would fight against his people, how could he look them in the eyes?” asked Alaa.
His family regarded Israelis, and not their fellow Palestinians, as the enemy. “To see someone from the same religion, same nationality, fighting against you? I feel like my heart is really breaking,” said the family matriarch, Umm Hassan.
The authority was already unpopular with many Palestinians, due to concerns over corruption and ineptitude. But according to interviews in Jenin, the operation there made enemies out of skeptics, triggered blowback even among some authority supporters — and underscored how the authority’s legitimacy is at risk when it cracks down on armed elements.
The campaign against the militants touched a nerve among many here who are frustrated with the authority’s inaction in the face of raids by the Israeli military and rising violence by Israeli settlers. Eager to prevent an open war with Israel, the Palestinian Authority avoids confrontation with Israeli forces, so militant groups have positioned themselves as Jenin’s defenders.
In the Damaj neighborhood, a militant hot spot, Issam Abu Amira, 50, surveyed the blackened husk of what had once been his home. Fourteen houses in the camp were torched in total. While the Palestinian Authority blamed militants, Jenin Mayor Mohammad Jarrar said authority forces were responsible.
Down the street, Abu Amira’s cousin, Amjad, 24, pointed to the cracked glass where a bullet had pierced his parents’ bedroom window while they were sleeping. “Before this,” he said, “we had no problem with the PA.”
Now, his mother, Umm Ibrahim, chimed in, “we hate them.” Could she forgive the Palestinian Authority? “Never,” she said.
The Israeli military strikes
In mid-January, community leaders in Jenin brokered a truce agreement that would have ended the campaign by the Palestinian security forces and allowed the militants to hold onto their weapons, as long as they were discreet.
A week later, the Israeli military resumed airstrikes in Jenin, killing 12 people over two nights, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. This was part of a major West Bank operation that has lasted more than three weeks, killing at least 25 people in the Jenin area — including the Funduq attackers — and displaced thousands of civilians, according to the Palestinian Authority, Israeli military and the United Nations.
Israeli officials said their operation was necessary because the authority had failed to root out Iranian-backed militancy. The authority has been “spectacularly unsuccessful in countering terrorism in Jenin in particular,” David Mencer, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister’s office, said in a news conference last week.
But the campaign undermined the standing of the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian officials and Middle East analysts said that might have been part of the intention for a right-wing government that includes ministers opposed to the authority’s existence.
“The minute the Gaza ceasefire went into effect, the operation started in the West Bank. … On the political level, I see it as a way the [Israeli] government is asserting itself. It’s saying, ‘We still control you,’” Zonszein said.
The Israeli operation was “meant to embarrass the PA,” according to Jarrar, Jenin’s mayor. He added, “I told them: ‘The Israelis want you to be seen as crippled, ineffectual.’”
The sequence of events fueled the perception among Palestinians that Israel and the Palestinian Authority were working in tandem. The Israeli campaign flushed militants out of the camp, allowing Palestinian security officers to arrest dozens of fighters in the surrounding countryside.
The Palestinian security forces “laid the groundwork for the Israelis,” said Nasser, Umm Ibrahim’s husband.

Bishop at prayer service urges Trump to ‘have mercy’,"While delivering the sermon at Washington National Cathedral on Tuesday, the Right Rev. Mariann Budde directly addressed President Donald Trump in her plea for unity.
“In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country,” she said to Trump at the prayer service. He sat feet away in the front row during the final official inaugural event.
Trump told the nation Monday that he saw divine intervention in his restoration to the White House. “I was saved by God to make America great again,” he said, referencing the assignation attempt against him in Pennsylvania.
Appearing to reference that statement, Budde called on Trump to help those fleeing war zones, to have mercy on children who “fear that their parents will be taken away” and to consider the “gay, lesbian, transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families, some who fear for their lives.”
This was not the first time Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, has directly addressed Trump’s language and conduct. She was among those who in 2019, during Trump’s first term, wrote a <a href=""https://cathedral.org/about/news-media/have-we-no-decency-a-response-to-president-trump/"" target=_blank>statement</a> that read in part, “After two years of President Trump’s words and actions, when will Americans have enough?”
A year later, Budde said she was “outraged” when federal officers used force to clear a crowd of peaceful demonstrators from the street between the White House and St. John’s Church, apparently so Trump could visit.
“Everything he has said and done is to inflame violence,” Budde told The Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/bishop-budde-trump-church/2020/06/01/20ca70f8-a466-11ea-b619-3f9133bbb482_story.html"" target=_blank>at the time</a>. “We need moral leadership, and he’s done everything to divide us.”",False
"Pope Francis rebukes Trump over mass deportations, warns it ‘will end badly’","Pope Francis sharply rebuked President Donald Trump’s policy of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and urged American Catholics not to lean into anti-immigrant sentiment in an open letter to U.S. Catholic bishops Tuesday.
“I exhort all the faithful of the Catholic Church, and all men and women of good will, not to give in to narratives that discriminate against and cause unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters,” Francis wrote in a lengthy letter.
The letter served as a strong rejection of Trump’s treatment of migrants, with the pope emphasizing that “an authentic rule of law is verified precisely in the dignified treatment that all people deserve, especially the poorest and most marginalized.” He warned that criminalizing immigrants for their legal status deprives them of their dignity and “will end badly.”
“The true common good is promoted when society and government, with creativity and strict respect for the rights of all — as I have affirmed on numerous occasions — welcomes, protects, promotes and integrates the most fragile, unprotected and vulnerable,” Francis wrote.
Francis’s letter comes as Vice President JD Vance has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/01/30/jd-vance-catholic-church-immigration/"" target=_blank>questioned</a> whether the Catholic Church’s substantial, decades-long work with migrants is driven by a desire for money — criticism that has dismayed Catholic leaders.
Trump and Francis have had back-and-forths dating back to Trump’s first candidacy in 2016, when the pope said Trump was “not Christian” for his plan to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The pontiff also called Trump’s plan to mass deport migrants “a disgrace” the day before his 2025 inauguration.",False
Trump fires Federal Labor Relations Authority member,"President <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/"" target=_blank>Donald Trump</a> fired Susan Tsui Grundmann, who until Tuesday served as chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, a White House official confirmed.
Grundmann’s firing from the agency tasked with overseeing public-sector unions appears to violate federal law that protects the agency’s board members from removal by the president without cause. In recent days, Trump has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/28/trump-fire-eeoc-nlrb-board-members/"" target=_blank>also taken the extraordinary step</a> of firing members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
The unprecedented wave of firings appears to contravene a 1935 Supreme Court ruling that shields the leaders of independent agencies from removal by the president “except in cases of neglect of duty, malfeasance or inefficiency.”
Grundmann’s term was set to expire in July.
A White House official said about the firing that Trump is committed to building a team that advances his “America First” agenda.
Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers’ union, said in a statement that Grundmann’s termination was “one more piece of evidence demonstrating this administration is engaged in a continued, unlawful attack on federal workers.”",True
