Ithought that would be the end of the damage… But with the election rightaround the corner, Kamala’s Deep State truly wants to ruin me with all they’vegot. They’re now considering dealing one final blow to me. A judge may noworder me to give up my remaining home in Florida – my primary residence. As mylawyer inquired: do they truly want me homeless? Over the last few days, we’veheard ridiculous claims about President Trump being a “fascist.” Let me tellyou what fascism is… Fascism is weaponizing the legal system to punish yourpolitical opponents. Fascism is having your home taken from you. Fascism istaking the law license away from your opponent’s lawyer. Fascism is trying toturn your enemies into political prisoners. I am living through theDemocrats’ fascism right now. I sincerely pray that freedom, justice, and thetruth prevail on Tuesday, November 5 – or the damage done to me will spreadlike wildfire to the rest of our great Republic. But, as I wrote to you in anearlier letter, the Bible reminds us that our earthly possessions will alwaysfade, but greater “heavenly treasures” await us. The pursuit of truth,freedom, and justice are worth infinitely more than a car or a home.Possessions come and go, but I couldNEVER SURRENDER my fight for freedom andfor what I know to betrue. I would be tone deaf if I didn’t acknowledge thattimes are tough right now for all Americans, not just me, so please stopreading here if you cannot give at this time.

Mark Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,I’ve spent a lot of time with Tim Kaine,2024-11-01T21:41:00,2024,11,1,21,41,markwarnerva.com,"Derek, I’ve had the honor of being Tim Kaine’s friend since we met at HarvardLaw School in 1980. For over 40 years, I’ve watched him wholeheartedly serveVirginia, first as mayor of Richmond, then as my Lieutenant Governor, andlater Governor, before serving together in the United States Senate. Thismeans I’ve spent a lot of time with Tim and gathered plenty of intel on him.So as I sat down to write this email asking you to support Senator Kaine’s re-election campaign, I found myself wondering exactly what I should say to youto assure you that Tim is the right choice to represent Virginia in Congress.And then it dawned on me: I want to tell you the top 3 things that annoy methe most about Tim Kaine. First off, Tim is way too nice! As a former civilrights attorney and missionary, he’s spent his entire career committed tosocial justice, being driven by the value of kindness and the belief that itcan change peoples’ lives. And he’s a genuinely good guy on top of that.Second, he’s ridiculously good at playing the harmonica. Seriously, he carriesthem in his briefcase, just in case a jam session breaks out on the Senatefloor. Third and finally, and I’ve said this before, he’s a deeply optimisticperson. Sometimes I can be a glass half-empty kind of guy, but Tim’s alwaysseems about ⅔ full. We need someone like Tim Kaine in the Senate. Tim’s valueof kindness and decency is what drives his undying dedication to serving thepeople of Virginia. And in a Congress plagued by partisan division, Tim’srelentless optimism keeps him from giving up in the crucial fights to protectvoting rights, safeguard a woman’s right to choose, and more. Now theharmonica… that one might not always translate to his work as a Senator, it’sjust really great to watch. The thing is, Tim’s seat could very well determineif the GOP takes control on Tuesday. Republicans are working overtime to ousthim and take back control of the Senate. So I’m asking you today if you cansplit a $5 donation between my campaign and Tim Kaine’s so we can send him,his kindness, impressive harmonica playing, and optimism back to the Senate?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?amount=5&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1 Ifyou've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation willbe automatically split between Tim Kaine and Mark Warner: EXPRESS DONATE $5https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=5&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $10 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=10&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $25 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=25&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $50 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=50&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $100 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=100&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1DONATE OTHER https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane_other=true&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1I know Tim very well, and I know he’s not done building a Virginia that worksfor all.

She's a leader of our MAGAmovement. She's a tough-as-nails Conservative. And she's a wall standing inthe way of the Democrats' radical agenda. She's also up for re-election inNovember. Normally, she would soar through the finish line since she's a topally of President Trump… but unfortunately, we have a problem. Chuck Schumerrecruited a power-hungry, showboating socialist in a desperate attempt todestroy any opposition to his agenda and defeat Marsha. In fact, Marsha'sopponent just joined forces with Hollywood elite types to turbocharge hernegative campaign to flip Tennessee. Let me say this in no uncertain terms: Ifthis radical socialist manages to flip Tennessee, our path to winning back theSenate Majority will COMPLETELY VANISH.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97So, with all that being said, I respectfully ask you for the FIRST TIME todonate right now to Marsha Blackburn's re-election campaign.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97PLEASE JOIN ME: DONATE NOW I don't send these types of emails very often. Ifyou're like me, these types of political emails kind of drive you crazy. Butthis is no ordinary request. Marsha Blackburn is exactly the kind of strong,patriotic conservative President Trump needs in the U.S. Senate. No surprisehere, but Marsha's socialist opponent turned to big liberal names to helpbankroll her campaign. Luckily, we have you on our side. If just 30% respondto my email, Marsha's socialist opponent will have no shot at EVER flippingthis key Senate seat. But first, I need your help right now. Please.

I’ve really enjoyed hitting the campaign trail and meeting with voters who are fired up and ready to win this race. We’re one step closer to flipping OR-05 and taking back the House. But here's the bad news : We’re up against millions of dollars in spending by deep-pocketed Republicans. My opponent, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, is backed by Republican special interest groups who are willing to spend whatever it takes to hold this seat. As they put more money into this race, we need a flood of support to fight back and make sure we’re not getting drowned out on the airwaves. That's why I'm personally asking: Will you split a donation between Tina Kotek and me today to help us keep our ads on the air and continue to reach undecided voters? With everything we’re up against, we can’t afford to fall short.

It's a testament to the journey ofgenerations of people who have worked, dreamed, and persevered to get us tothis moment. Our community's story is one of resilience — of voices thatrefuse to be dimmed and of traditions that continue to shine brightly acrosscontinents. We see this in the vibrant celebrations happening in homes andcommunities across the nation. In the glow of clay lamps, in the warmth ofshared meals, in the sparkle of joy that connects us. To our diverse SouthAsian community — Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains — this is a momentto honor our collective strength. To recognize the challenges we face, thefears that sometimes shadow our experiences, and also the power we have touplift, to support, and to create meaningful change.

As we get closer to Election Day, I wanted to shine a light on Lisa Blunt Rochester, the Congresswoman from Delaware. Right now, she is in a heated race to become Delaware’s next Senator. In a minute, I’ll explain why you should chip in to support Lisa’s historic campaign. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q42024] SUPPORT LISA → [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q42024] Lisa’s career as a public servant epitomizes the definition of what it means to be a leader and champion for everyone. Time and time again, she has helped create and pass meaningful legislation to build up our middle class, protect our seniors, and defend our voting and reproductive rights. In short, Lisa’s mission of Bright Hope is one she hopes to bring to the Senate. But her self-funding opponent would rather spend nearly a million dollars to keep his campaign afloat and defend the overturning of Roe. I wish I was joking on that last point. The scary thing about all of this is that Delaware will be crucial to the Democrats’ hopes of protecting their Senate majority.

Even if you don’t agree with all thedetails, we need to start discussing solutions to the problems that my planwill solve: a dysfunctional welfare system, the looming insolvency of SocialSecurity and Medicare, and our mounting national debt. Right now, I am theonly one even attempting to think about these crucial issues and offering apossible plan.

But with yoursupport, I can start on the work of turning our country around. Without it, wewill have to wait that much longer to have these discussions, and meanwhileour debts will keep increasing, making solutions that much more difficult toimplement.

The only way Trisha can fight back and finally put an end to Boebert’s embarrassing political “career” is with support from grassroots donors like you now. In 2022, Lauren Boebert only won by 546 votes. It was the closest race in the entire country. So we need grassroots donors like you to give every dollar you can spare now if Democratic nominee Trisha Calvarese is going to beat Boebert and take back the House for Democrats. **This seat could be the difference between taking back the House or letting Republicans stay in control. But Trisha’s not taking a dime from corporate PACs, so we’ve got nowhere else to turn:** **Please, will you make a donation now – every single dollar you can afford – to help Trisha Calvarese defeat Lauren Boebert, turn this seat blue, and take back the House for Democrats?** _Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  We’re so grateful that you’re a part of this campaign.Thank you,Team Trisha  ********Paid for by Trisha 4 ColoradoTrisha 4 Colorado PO Box 630633 Highlands Ranch, CO 80130Contributions or gifts to Trisha 4 Colorado are not tax deductible.This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

There's a strong chance it will all come down to Ohio, which meansSherrod is the ONLY thing standing between us and a Republican Senate. Friend,I've worked on campaigns for a long time. I've been on the winning side andthe losing side. If there's one thing I know, it's that money makes a BIGdifference. I wish it weren't the case, but it is. TV ads, phone banks, yardsigns, campaign events in every corner of the state – it all adds up FAST.That's why I'm so terrified right now. If this were a simple battle betweengood and evil, I wouldn't be worried – Sherrod is as good a leader as Ohioanshave ever had. He fights harder for workers than anybody I know, and he's notafraid to take on the big banks and corporations that are making things harderfor the middle class. But money muddies the waters, and his opponent has got aton of it. He's poured A TON into his own campaign, and there's a lot morewhere that came from. Sherrod simply doesn't have that kind of money – sothat's where this grassroots team needs to come in and have his back, friend.I know Sherrod can win this critical race and keep the Senate blue, but ONLYIF we all come together to give him the resources he needs. So I'm asking:Will you rush $5, $25, or even $50 to help him win in Ohio and defend ourSenate majority? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?amounts=250,100,50,25,5&refcode;=jtk3725-fr-text Thanks for doingyour part – there's simply no other option if we want to save the Senate! –James Carville -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Can I count on you to step up with a split donation of $10 today to ensure my team and I have the resources we need to push back against the $40 million worth of attack ads Ted Cruz and his allies are running against us right now? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Last time around, Ted Cruz won his race by just over 2% of the vote – that was a difference of about 215,000 votes, friend. I remember how it felt watching the results roll in on November 6, 2018, and let me tell you, it was a nail-biter. I have no doubts that this year will be when we finally send Ted Cruz packing. But despite being closer than ever to defeating Ted, we've still got a lot more work to do and only a handful of days left to do it. I know seeing a number like $500,000 can feel overwhelming, but if thousands of hardworking folks like you chip in $5 here, $25 there, and the occasional $100, we will be able to collectively reach this critical goal. So please, will you chip in a split donation between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's of $10 or whatever you can afford now so I can hit my daily fundraising goal and flip Texas blue? We've got zero time left to go, so let's get it done, friend! https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thanks for being on my team, Colin Allred -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

I need you to know that we neverwould have gotten to a point where the polls are statistically tied, wherebrand new polling data has me leading by 18 points with independent voters,where Rick Scott is forced to spend tens of millions of dollars to competewith our grassroots movement, and where the major Democratic committees spendmillions of dollars of their own money to help us because they believe in us!Thank you, friend. A year ago at this time, the political pundits wrote offFlorida completely. We put Florida in play. We gave Rick Scott his notice. Weare on the cusp of pulling off the greatest political upset in modern history.But Rick Scott is outspending me nearly 3-to-1 on the airwaves — and he'salready spent over $38 million on ads to defeat me. Well, I don't have afraudulently earned fortune like him to tap into. I have you, friend. I havethis grassroots movement. And I can only fight back and win by closing in onmy final $4 million goal before Election Day. So please, will you make adonation of $5 or more to help me make history here in Florida?

If it wasn’t obvious before, it’s crystalclear now: David McCormick is wrong for Pennsylvania. But this will be one ofthe toughest races of the year for Democrats. McCormick has millions uponmillions of dollars of his own to dump into this race, in addition to thebacking of Donald Trump and billionaire-funded super PACs. Pennsylvania is ascompetitive as it gets, and with the Senate majority and the White Housedepending on it, we can’t take anything for granted.
