But hell, if you wantto click here and chip in right away, I'm not gonna stop you.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?amounts=250,100,50,25,5&refcode;=jtk3725-fr-text I'll get right into it:Democrats have a razor-thin Senate majority, and we're facing a NIGHTMARESenate map. There's a strong chance it will all come down to Ohio, which meansSherrod is the ONLY thing standing between us and a Republican Senate. Friend,I've worked on campaigns for a long time. I've been on the winning side andthe losing side. If there's one thing I know, it's that money makes a BIGdifference. I wish it weren't the case, but it is. TV ads, phone banks, yardsigns, campaign events in every corner of the state \u2013 it all adds up FAST.That's why I'm so terrified right now. If this were a simple battle betweengood and evil, I wouldn't be worried \u2013 Sherrod is as good a leader as Ohioanshave ever had. He fights harder for workers than anybody I know, and he's notafraid to take on the big banks and corporations that are making things harderfor the middle class. But money muddies the waters, and his opponent has got aton of it. He's poured A TON into his own campaign, and there's a lot morewhere that came from. Sherrod simply doesn't have that kind of money \u2013 sothat's where this grassroots team needs to come in and have his back, friend.I know Sherrod can win this critical race and keep the Senate blue, but ONLYIF we all come together to give him the resources he needs. So I'm asking:Will you rush $5, $25, or even $50 to help him win in Ohio and defend ourSenate majority? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?amounts=250,100,50,25,5&refcode;=jtk3725-fr-text Thanks for doingyour part \u2013 there's simply no other option if we want to save the Senate! \u2013James Carville -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.
