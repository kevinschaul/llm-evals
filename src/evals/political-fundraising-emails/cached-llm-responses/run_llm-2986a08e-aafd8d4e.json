Can I count on you to step up with a split donation of $10 today to ensure my team and I have the resources we need to push back against the $40 million worth of attack ads Ted Cruz and his allies are running against us right now? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Last time around, Ted Cruz won his race by just over 2% of the vote \u2013 that was a difference of about 215,000 votes, friend. I remember how it felt watching the results roll in on November 6, 2018, and let me tell you, it was a nail-biter. I have no doubts that this year will be when we finally send Ted Cruz packing. But despite being closer than ever to defeating Ted, we've still got a lot more work to do and only a handful of days left to do it. I know seeing a number like $500,000 can feel overwhelming, but if thousands of hardworking folks like you chip in $5 here, $25 there, and the occasional $100, we will be able to collectively reach this critical goal. So please, will you chip in a split donation between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's of $10 or whatever you can afford now so I can hit my daily fundraising goal and flip Texas blue? We've got zero time left to go, so let's get it done, friend! https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thanks for being on my team, Colin Allred -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.
