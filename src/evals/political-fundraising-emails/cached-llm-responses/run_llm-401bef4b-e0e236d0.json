The family down the road maynot think, pray, or love like you, but they are your neighbors and you lookout for them. Now we know that Donald Trump, JD Vance, and MAGA Republicanshave a different vision of America. When they talk about freedom they mean thegovernment should have the freedom to invade every corner of our life. Take itfrom a small-town guy: they know nothing about what working people need.That's not what we do in Minnesota. We don\u2019t attack our neighbors\u2019 rights. Wewelcome everyone in, and we lift each other up. My friend Tina Smithunderstands this. And she works hard every day to ensure Minnesotans\u2019 voicesare heard in the United States Senate. That\u2019s what this campaign is about:working together to build a future where everyone has the opportunity not justto get by, but to get ahead. Where workers come first, health care and housingare human rights, and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom. Butwe need you in this fight with us. Will you split a donation of $10, orwhatever works for you right now, between Tina Smith and our campaign so wecan continue working together and defend our values up and down the ballot inNovember?
