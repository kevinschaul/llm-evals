As we get closer to Election Day, I wanted to shine a light on Lisa Blunt Rochester, the Congresswoman from Delaware. Right now, she is in a heated race to become Delaware\u2019s next Senator. In a minute, I\u2019ll explain why you should chip in to support Lisa\u2019s historic campaign. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q42024] SUPPORT LISA \u2192 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q42024] Lisa\u2019s career as a public servant epitomizes the definition of what it means to be a leader and champion for everyone. Time and time again, she has helped create and pass meaningful legislation to build up our middle class, protect our seniors, and defend our voting and reproductive rights. In short, Lisa\u2019s mission of Bright Hope is one she hopes to bring to the Senate. But her self-funding opponent would rather spend nearly a million dollars to keep his campaign afloat and defend the overturning of Roe. I wish I was joking on that last point. The scary thing about all of this is that Delaware will be crucial to the Democrats\u2019 hopes of protecting their Senate majority. With a one-seat majority on the line, we need to do everything we can to lock this seat down and make Lisa the first Black and woman senator from Delaware. Folks \u2013 Election Day will be here before you know it. And in order to stop Trump, Vance, and Project 2025, we need to support Lisa Blunt Rochester by chipping in $10 or more to her campaign today.
