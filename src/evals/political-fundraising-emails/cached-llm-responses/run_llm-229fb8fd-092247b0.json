Just four days to determine the next four years. **We can turn the page on the chaos and division of Donald Trump -- but not without your help reaching every last voter and getting them to the polls.** So I am kindly asking folks like you to chip in for the first time today. Will you make a $47 contribution to elect Kamala and Tim and defeat Trump? It wasn\u2019t that many weeks ago when Tim got a call -- _the call_ \\-- from Vice President Harris asking him to join this ticket. Ever since then, it\u2019s been a whirlwind. I have traveled across the country meeting all different kinds of voters: proud Democrats who vote frequently, folks who are still deciding, folks who don\u2019t vote in every election -- and yes, Republicans. **Everywhere I go, people are fed up with Donald Trump and fired up for Kamala and Tim\u2019s new way forward.** But I won\u2019t mince words, Peter. We remain the underdogs in this race. Nothing less than our very democracy is at stake. And we must win. In an election as close as this one, grassroots supporters like you will make the difference. With time running out, please give your first $47 to power our critical voter outreach efforts in these final days. _If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:_ | | $47 >> --- | $75 >> --- | $100 >> --- | $250 >> --- | $500 >> --- | Other >> ---  Thank you.
