[https://secure.ngpvan.com/TH6jNlvmHkWLixoO_CJ0wQ2] Hey \u2014it\u2019s Jon. I did an interview with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell on MSNBC, where we talkedabout Montana\u2019s Senate election.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_tester?refcode=em20241101mid2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=99aae5e1-8b98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_tester?refcode=em20241101mid2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=99aae5e1-8b98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]BeforeI share more, can you make a split donation of any amount to our campaigntoday to help us build resources to turn out the voters we need to win? Agenerous group of donors just agreed to match every donation \u2014 but only forthis email.[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_tester?refcode=em20241101mid2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=99aae5e1-8b98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Here\u2019s what I said to Lawrence: I\u2019m in the fight of my life to defendMontana\u2019s Senate seat\u2014and we need more grassroots support to win. It\u2019s nosecret that Mitch McConnell is determined to defeat me. He personallyrecruited a wealthy out-of-stater to run in this race, and his buddies arespending nearly $90 million to smear my record. I hate to say it, but thatspending is working: Polls are tied. Now we have less than three weeks untilMontanans start voting. You can bet Mitch McConnell\u2019s buddies will throweverything but the kitchen sink at us to win this race. I\u2019m working torepresent rural communities and defend our Montana way of life, but I can\u2019t doit alone. If we want to win this race, then our campaign needs moresupport\u2014fast. Can you split $10 or more to help us reach more voters? Anyamount you can give will be matched.[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_tester?refcode=em20241101mid2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=99aae5e1-8b98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_tester?refcode=em20241101mid2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=99aae5e1-8b98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_tester?refcode=em20241101mid2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=99aae5e1-8b98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_tester?refcode=em20241101mid2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=99aae5e1-8b98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_tester?refcode=em20241101mid2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=99aae5e1-8b98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_tester?refcode=em20241101mid2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=99aae5e1-8b98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_tester?refcode=em20241101mid2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=99aae5e1-8b98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Thanks, Jon Paid for by Adam for Colorado.Adam for Colorado PO Box 1240Glenwood Springs, CO 81602 United States Contributions or gifts to Adam forColorado are not tax deductible.
