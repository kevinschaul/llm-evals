This Senate race is going to be way tooclose for comfort. We KNOW that in order to defeat Larry Hogan and his MAGAsuper PACs, we need to knock on 850,000 doors throughout Maryland. We KNOWthat to reach the undecided voters that will decide this neck-and-neck race,we\u2019ve got to log 9,100 volunteer canvassing shifts. We KNOW that holdingMaryland blue and defending our Democratic Senate majority means we must call1 million Maryland voters.
