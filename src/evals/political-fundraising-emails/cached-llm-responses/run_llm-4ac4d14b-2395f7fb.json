Every single Republican Senator and Senate candidate isfacing this final deadline.**  **And for our nominees in battleground states, it could be a make or breakmoment.** **That 's why I'm asking you to split a donation between these candidates andmy campaign ASAP.** _**Tim Sheehy, who served as a Navy Seal,**_ is running in Montana against JonTester.  _**Dave McCormick, a fellow Army veteran,**_ is running in Pennsylvaniaagainst Bob Casey.  _**Sam Brown, another fellow Army veteran,**_ is running in Nevada againstJacky Rosen.  _**Bernie Moreno, a proven business leader,**_ is running in Ohio againstSherrod Brown.  _**And Kari Lake, a tough conservative who will put America first,**_ isrunning in Arizona. ********************************************************SPLIT A DONATIONHERE************************************************** ****** If these tough conservatives win, it guarantees Republicans win the U.S.Senate.  And I need each of them there with me to stop the Marxist Left in its tracks,and to make America strong again.  **A donation of any amount will go directly to their campaigns, and *anyamount* will make a difference ahead of this critical marker.**  As I've also said before, if we don't win in November, we're done. So, if youcan give at this time, don't wait. **Help each of these tough conservativesbefore this final deadline, and let 's win in 4 days.**  In service, ![Tom CottonSignature](https://e.youramerica.news/rd/9z2zipjmcrcs60r0ke102055ikjufalmvqnr95gqf0g_rp22sh2s8i6epj0clgmcob0c3h2bs) Tom Cotton ![Tom Cottonheadshot](https://image.e.redsparkstrategy.com/lib/fe2e11727364047c701278/m/1/e00c1b84-0119-43d1-ba85-27b9768a3c50.jpg)  ********************************************************DONATENOW************************************************** ******                            | Paid for by the NRSC.
