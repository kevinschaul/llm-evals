At the state legislative ballot level, races come down to a handful of votes, and resources are limited. A 5X-matched gift of $7 could give our in-state partners the necessary resources to fund get-out-the-vote efforts, hire digital staff, and invest in TV ads to spread our message across the airwaves. **Your 5X-matched $7 donation could be the difference between electing state Democrats who will fight to protect abortion rights or losing to one of our far-right Republican opponents who aim to attack all of our fundamental freedoms.** Before our match extension ends, we\u2019re asking you directly. Is seeing Democrats win next week and defeating MAGA Republicans worth $7 to you? If it is, own a piece of this fight by chipping in now. We\u2019re working to expand Democratic power, defend our majorities, and break up Republican supermajorities this fall \u2013 but it all starts with a donation from grassroots supporters like you. If you step up and decide $7 is worth investing before our deadline, you can feel good knowing that you helped Democrats gain power in states nationwide. We\u2019re asking again: Will you donate a 5X-matched gift of $7 to help state Democrats defeat extreme Republicans in this election and beyond? | If you've stored your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately.  --- | 5X-MATCH $7 --- | 5X-MATCH $25 --- | 5X-MATCH $50 --- | 5X-MATCH $100 --- | 5X-MATCH $250 --- | OTHER \u00bb ---  Thank you so much,Team DLCC  **5X-MATCH: ACTIVE \u00bb** **MAKE IT MONTHLY \u00bb**             | --- Paid for by the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, dlcc.org.
