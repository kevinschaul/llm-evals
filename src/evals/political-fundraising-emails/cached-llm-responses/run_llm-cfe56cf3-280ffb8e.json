But first, I have to ask:will you chip in to help us reach our final pre-election goal of raising$20,000 from grassroots supporters? We\u2019re starting off well, but still have aways to go over the next couple of days.Donate>>https://secure.actblue.com/donate/cooke-q4-2024?refcode=em-11.2.24-all-1-aNow, the good news: We have an ever-so-slight lead in the latest polls in ourrace. Plus, election analysts have shifted the race slightly in our favor.These updates show the momentum we\u2019ve built throughout this people-poweredcampaign. And I\u2019m thankful for every single supporter who helped us get tothis point. But we can\u2019t get complacent, Peter, because here\u2019s the bad news:We are being heavily outspent by Derrick Van Orden and his extremist, deep-pocketed allies and super PACs. They\u2019ve just doubled their ad buys in the mostcompetitive media markets in WI-03. That\u2019s concerning because we need to winthose communities to prevail in three days. Here\u2019s the bottom line: we need asurge of grassroots support NOW to counter Van Orden\u2019s ad push and big-dollardonors as we enter the final stretch of this race. Will you contributewhatever you can today to help flip WI-03? What matters most is that we get asmany people donating as we can, because it adds up fast.
