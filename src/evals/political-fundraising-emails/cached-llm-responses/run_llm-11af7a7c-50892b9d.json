All while Trump is doubling down on hisrhetoric, excusing the January 6 insurrection, and threatening to use the U.S.military on his political opponents whom he calls \u201cthe enemy from within.\u201d IfMAGA Republicans flip this seat red, it could destroy our hopes of taking backthe House \u2014 and send a dangerously unfit Republican to Congress instead of afighter for our communities like Jahana. Here is the solution: Early voting inConnecticut is underway. We have a busy week ahead of us organizing across thedistrict. We could use the extra resources to reach more voters if you canspare a few bucks today. Can you contribute $10 or any amount to help us turnout voters and reelect Jahana Hayes? The only poll that matters is the one onElection Day, and this race is looking razor-thin.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jh-em-nov2024?amount=10] If you've savedyour payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go throughimmediately: $5 \u2192 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jh-em-nov2024?express_lane=true&amount;=5] $10 \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jh-em-nov2024?express_lane=true&amount;=10]$25 \u2192 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jh-em-nov2024?express_lane=true&amount;=25] $50 \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jh-em-nov2024?express_lane=true&amount;=50]$100 \u2192 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jh-em-nov2024?express_lane=true&amount;=100] Other \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jh-em-nov2024] There is not much time left,but your support \u2014 especially this close to Election Day \u2014 makes an enormousdifference.
