If you\u2019re way too online like me, you\u2019ve probably seen a tonof headlines about a bunch of rich guys running for Senate in states wherethey don't even live. Connecticut mega-millionaire David McCormick is one ofthose rich guys, and he\u2019s running against beloved Pennsylvania Senator, BobCasey. So look, this will be a very close race, and we need to do everythingwe can to make sure Bob wins \u2014 [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/casey-em-20241101-2?refcode=em20241101-2&refcode2;=4745_552475_IPLfG2&akid;=4745%2E552475%2EIPLfG2]which is why I\u2019m asking if you\u2019ll contribute $5 towards his campaign today.David McCormick is a former Wall Street hedge-fund exec who wants you to thinkhe grew up on a Pennsylvania farm, which is only true if you think that livingin a mansion 10 minutes down the road from a farm where your family raisedArabian horses counts as \u201cgrowing up on a farm.\u201d But wait, Peter, there'smore: McCormick also thinks the most popular beer in Pennsylvania is called\u201cYANG-ling,\u201d which is like running for Senate in Massachusetts and saying youwant coffee from \"DOON-kin\u2019 Donuts.\" If it wasn\u2019t obvious before, it\u2019s crystalclear now: David McCormick is wrong for Pennsylvania. But this will be one ofthe toughest races of the year for Democrats. McCormick has millions uponmillions of dollars of his own to dump into this race, in addition to thebacking of Donald Trump and billionaire-funded super PACs. Pennsylvania is ascompetitive as it gets, and with the Senate majority and the White Housedepending on it, we can\u2019t take anything for granted.
