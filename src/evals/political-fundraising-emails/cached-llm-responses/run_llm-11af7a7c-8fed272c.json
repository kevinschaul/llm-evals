Even if you don\u2019t agree with all thedetails, we need to start discussing solutions to the problems that my planwill solve: a dysfunctional welfare system, the looming insolvency of SocialSecurity and Medicare, and our mounting national debt. Right now, I am theonly one even attempting to think about these crucial issues and offering apossible plan. It is of course an ambitious plan, and things will obviouslynot change overnight, and if elected I would only be able to take the firststeps toward the discussions that would lead to such solutions. But with yoursupport, I can start on the work of turning our country around. Without it, wewill have to wait that much longer to have these discussions, and meanwhileour debts will keep increasing, making solutions that much more difficult toimplement. Please add your voice to mine so that we can start on the processof real transformation that will change all of our lives, returning to us ourfreedom and prosperity.
