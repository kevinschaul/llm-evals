Ithought that would be the end of the damage\u2026 But with the election rightaround the corner, Kamala\u2019s Deep State truly wants to ruin me with all they\u2019vegot. They\u2019re now considering dealing one final blow to me. A judge may noworder me to give up my remaining home in Florida \u2013 my primary residence. As mylawyer inquired: do they truly want me homeless? Over the last few days, we\u2019veheard ridiculous claims about President Trump being a \u201cfascist.\u201d Let me tellyou what fascism is\u2026 Fascism is weaponizing the legal system to punish yourpolitical opponents. Fascism is having your home taken from you. Fascism istaking the law license away from your opponent\u2019s lawyer. Fascism is trying toturn your enemies into political prisoners. I am living through theDemocrats\u2019 fascism right now. I sincerely pray that freedom, justice, and thetruth prevail on Tuesday, November 5 \u2013 or the damage done to me will spreadlike wildfire to the rest of our great Republic. But, as I wrote to you in anearlier letter, the Bible reminds us that our earthly possessions will alwaysfade, but greater \u201cheavenly treasures\u201d await us. The pursuit of truth,freedom, and justice are worth infinitely more than a car or a home.Possessions come and go, but I couldNEVER SURRENDER my fight for freedom andfor what I know to betrue. I would be tone deaf if I didn\u2019t acknowledge thattimes are tough right now for all Americans, not just me, so please stopreading here if you cannot give at this time. But funding my Legal DefenseTrust is my last remaining hope of fighting for my freedom and for the libertyand justice of all Americans. So, if you can, and, seriously, only if you can,please make a contribution to my Legal Defense Trust \u2013 the Rudy GiulianiFreedom Fund \u2013 as I keep fighting for my freedom and justice as Kamala\u2019s DeepState tries to JAIL me for life.
