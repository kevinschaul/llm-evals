Ultimately, this election is about two different visions for ournation. One focused on the future . And one focused on the past . Tim Kaineand I believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just toget by, but to get ahead. Where no child has to grow up in poverty. Whereevery worker has the freedom to join a union. Where every person hasaffordable health care, child care, and paid leave. Where every senior canretire with dignity. But Donald Trump and his extremist Republican allies wantto take our country backward. They intend to cut Social Security and Medicare,to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and to make workingfamilies foot the bill, and end the Affordable Care Act. America has triedthese failed policies before. We are not going back. Generations of Americansbefore us led the fight for freedom. Now, the baton is in our hands. Toprotect the right to vote. To get assault weapons off of our streets. Torestore reproductive freedom, reversing Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans.Tim Kaine has spent his entire career fighting to improve the lives ofeveryday Virginians, and he knows there is more to be done. If you are readyto join us in the fight for freedom and opportunity for all, please split adonation of $10 to our campaigns. Because when we fight, we win.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-2024-kamala] Thank you and take care,Kamala Kamala Harris Vice President of the United Stateshttps://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-2024-kamala[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-2024-kamala] CONTRIBUTE[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-2024-kamala] Paid for by Kaine forVirginia Kaine for Virginia P.O.
