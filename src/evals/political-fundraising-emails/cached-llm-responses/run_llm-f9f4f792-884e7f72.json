Everything is OK, it'sjust that I'm a bundle of nerves and excitement in these final days of thecampaign, where we are so close to actually defeating Rick Scott andprotecting Democratic control of the Senate! I need you to know that we neverwould have gotten to a point where the polls are statistically tied, wherebrand new polling data has me leading by 18 points with independent voters,where Rick Scott is forced to spend tens of millions of dollars to competewith our grassroots movement, and where the major Democratic committees spendmillions of dollars of their own money to help us because they believe in us!Thank you, friend. A year ago at this time, the political pundits wrote offFlorida completely. We put Florida in play. We gave Rick Scott his notice. Weare on the cusp of pulling off the greatest political upset in modern history.But Rick Scott is outspending me nearly 3-to-1 on the airwaves \u2014 and he'salready spent over $38 million on ads to defeat me. Well, I don't have afraudulently earned fortune like him to tap into. I have you, friend. I havethis grassroots movement. And I can only fight back and win by closing in onmy final $4 million goal before Election Day. So please, will you make adonation of $5 or more to help me make history here in Florida? Whatever yougive will be put to work immediately to counter Rick Scott's attack ads,defeat him once and for all, and save our Democratic Senate majority!https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2478-fr-text Well, there's another cup of coffee gone \u2615\ufe0f.
