For over 40 years, I\u2019ve watched him wholeheartedly serveVirginia, first as mayor of Richmond, then as my Lieutenant Governor, andlater Governor, before serving together in the United States Senate. Thismeans I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Tim and gathered plenty of intel on him.So as I sat down to write this email asking you to support Senator Kaine\u2019s re-election campaign, I found myself wondering exactly what I should say to youto assure you that Tim is the right choice to represent Virginia in Congress.And then it dawned on me: I want to tell you the top 3 things that annoy methe most about Tim Kaine. First off, Tim is way too nice! As a former civilrights attorney and missionary, he\u2019s spent his entire career committed tosocial justice, being driven by the value of kindness and the belief that itcan change peoples\u2019 lives. And he\u2019s a genuinely good guy on top of that.Second, he\u2019s ridiculously good at playing the harmonica. Seriously, he carriesthem in his briefcase, just in case a jam session breaks out on the Senatefloor. Third and finally, and I\u2019ve said this before, he\u2019s a deeply optimisticperson. Sometimes I can be a glass half-empty kind of guy, but Tim\u2019s alwaysseems about \u2154 full. We need someone like Tim Kaine in the Senate. Tim\u2019s valueof kindness and decency is what drives his undying dedication to serving thepeople of Virginia. And in a Congress plagued by partisan division, Tim\u2019srelentless optimism keeps him from giving up in the crucial fights to protectvoting rights, safeguard a woman\u2019s right to choose, and more. Now theharmonica\u2026 that one might not always translate to his work as a Senator, it\u2019sjust really great to watch. The thing is, Tim\u2019s seat could very well determineif the GOP takes control on Tuesday. Republicans are working overtime to ousthim and take back control of the Senate. So I\u2019m asking you today if you cansplit a $5 donation between my campaign and Tim Kaine\u2019s so we can send him,his kindness, impressive harmonica playing, and optimism back to the Senate?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?amount=5&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1 Ifyou've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation willbe automatically split between Tim Kaine and Mark Warner: EXPRESS DONATE $5https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=5&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $10 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=10&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $25 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=25&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $50 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=50&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $100 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=100&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1DONATE OTHER https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane_other=true&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1I know Tim very well, and I know he\u2019s not done building a Virginia that worksfor all.
