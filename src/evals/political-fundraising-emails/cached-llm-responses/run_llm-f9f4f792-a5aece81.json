Also known as the Festival of Lights, it\u2019s a moment ofillumination, of connection, and of profound possibility.

Now we stand at the brink of an even more transformative moment.It\u2019s not just a political milestone. It's a testament to the journey ofgenerations of people who have worked, dreamed, and persevered to get us tothis moment. Our community's story is one of resilience \u2014 of voices thatrefuse to be dimmed and of traditions that continue to shine brightly acrosscontinents. We see this in the vibrant celebrations happening in homes andcommunities across the nation. In the glow of clay lamps, in the warmth ofshared meals, in the sparkle of joy that connects us. To our diverse SouthAsian community \u2014 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains \u2014 this is a momentto honor our collective strength. To recognize the challenges we face, thefears that sometimes shadow our experiences, and also the power we have touplift, to support, and to create meaningful change. As we gather with familyand friends, let us recommit ourselves to a future of true belonging. Whereevery voice matters, where every story is heard, where our collective lightcan transform our shared landscape.
