She's a leader of our MAGAmovement. She's a tough-as-nails Conservative. And she's a wall standing inthe way of the Democrats' radical agenda. She's also up for re-election inNovember. Normally, she would soar through the finish line since she's a topally of President Trump\u2026 but unfortunately, we have a problem. Chuck Schumerrecruited a power-hungry, showboating socialist in a desperate attempt todestroy any opposition to his agenda and defeat Marsha. In fact, Marsha'sopponent just joined forces with Hollywood elite types to turbocharge hernegative campaign to flip Tennessee. Let me say this in no uncertain terms: Ifthis radical socialist manages to flip Tennessee, our path to winning back theSenate Majority will COMPLETELY VANISH.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97So, with all that being said, I respectfully ask you for the FIRST TIME todonate right now to Marsha Blackburn's re-election campaign.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97PLEASE JOIN ME: DONATE NOW I don't send these types of emails very often. Ifyou're like me, these types of political emails kind of drive you crazy. Butthis is no ordinary request. Marsha Blackburn is exactly the kind of strong,patriotic conservative President Trump needs in the U.S. Senate. No surprisehere, but Marsha's socialist opponent turned to big liberal names to helpbankroll her campaign. Luckily, we have you on our side. If just 30% respondto my email, Marsha's socialist opponent will have no shot at EVER flippingthis key Senate seat. But first, I need your help right now. Please. I'mpersonally asking for your help.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97So, I hope that's enough to convince you. If it's not, I fear we could loseTennessee - and the ENTIRE U.S. Senate along with it.
