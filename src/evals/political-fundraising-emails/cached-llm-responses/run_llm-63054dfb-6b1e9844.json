I have a rare five minutes between campaignevents and wanted to reach out with a humble request. The Cook PoliticalReport is calling Nevada the \"most perilous\" battleground for Democrats \u2013 anda new poll shows me tied 48-48 with my Trump-endorsed opponent. Nevadans havealready started voting, and we urgently need to ramp up our operation soDemocrats can win this state \u2013 but we just don\u2019t have the resources in thebank to do that right now. There is no holding the Senate without winningNevada. And the more voters we can mobilize, the better odds Kamala Harris hasof winning this state AND the presidency. Can you please make a donation to mycampaign? Anything you can give means a lot to me personally.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_1124?refcode=jtk5274-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Thank you, Jacky -------- This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.
