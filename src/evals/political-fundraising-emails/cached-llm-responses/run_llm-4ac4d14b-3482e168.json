THEN \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15] Vice-President KamalaHarris CRUSHED [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15] her CNNtown hall and made the choice in this election clearer than ever. SO THEN \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15] Michelle Obama went toMichigan to RALLY [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15] forour Democratic ticket and warn voters about what\u2019s at stake if lawless Trump \u2013who promises to be a dictator on Day 1 and calls fellow citizens the \u201cenemywithin\u201d \u2013 gets back into power. NOW \u2192 We have the momentum, and we can\u2019t giveit back! That\u2019s why I\u2019m marshaling 2,000 Voter Outreach Members to chip inbefore it\u2019s too late. Together, we can TURN OUT every last Democrat, FLIP theHouse, and persuade voters that we can\u2019t afford another four years of Trump\u2019schaos and destruction. But that takes resources \u2013 and we only have 4 daysleft. So I\u2019m asking you personally, because we have nowhere else to go: Willyou chip in $15 or whatever you can spare in these final make-or-make momentsof the election? >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15]2024 Voter Outreach Program[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15] NAME:dpwillis67@gmail.com [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15]ID: 117907000 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15]CONTRIBUTION: UNCONFIRMED[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15] SUGGESTED DONATION: $15>> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15] Chip in $15 now >>[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=15] Chip in $25 now >>[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=25] Chip in $50 now >>[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=50] Chip in $100 now >>[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=100] Chip in another amountnow >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/npem2024?amount=250] Thank you,NANCY Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi is the U.S. Representative for California\u2019s11th District.
