So we can\u2019t leave them any room to deny thatKamala Harris will be our next President, Peter! We have to get every lastDemocrat to the polls, turn out a record number of voters to support her, andget a Blue Wave going from the White House down! But we can\u2019t win without you.Right now, Kamala and Trump are locked in a neck-and-neck race to the finishline, Democrats are at risk of losing the Senate, and so much is on the lineon Election Night. Can we count on you to chip in $15 or more to Blue AmpAction today so we can invest in getting Kamala and other key Democratselected? Your support will allow us to send money where it\u2019s needed most,combat misinformation, and show Trump once and for all that the Americanpeople REJECT him and his extremist views. Your support will give Democratsthe momentum they need to pull ahead in this critical moment and WIN. Soplease, Peter, can you chip in any amount to Blue Amp Action today? With just3 days left to guarantee Democrats can keep the White House, maintain theirSenate majority, and flip the House, anything you can give will go a long way. --- | | DONATE --- | Thank you! \\- The Team @ Blue Amp Action --- | --- | | |  --- | --- | | |  --- | | | | |  --- | | | ![](https://default.salsalabs.org/fde5f520-5281-42ed-9182-51d72f7d8617/bdd7c5f5-7de1-4347-b64e-b4284329efec.png) | Cliff Schecter President, Blue Amp Action Amplify Good  ---|--- | | |  --- | | Follow Us | ![](https://blueampstrategies.salsalabs.org/public/images/icons/medium-auto_twitter2.png) | ![](https://blueampstrategies.salsalabs.org/public/images/icons/medium-auto_linkedin.png) ---|---  | **Blue Amp Action PAC** PO Box 8384, Cincinnati, OH 45208 --- | Having trouble viewing this email? View it in your web browser --- | | |  --- | | | About BlueAmp Action: We cannot sugarcoat the current situation. Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day. So our kids grow up in democracy, not dystopia. Thank you for your support for all we do!
