My team and I are working hard to flip Colorado\u2019s 4th congressional district blue so that Democrats can take back the House, finally put an end to Lauren Boebert\u2019s ridiculous political career, and stop Boebert from receiving a lifetime congressional pension. **But I have to be honest: With less than 3 days left until Election Day, we have a real problem.** Right now, we\u2019re falling behind on our fundraising goals, and my team tells me that unless we raise another $30,000 before midnight tonight, we\u2019re going to have to cut our GOTV budget \u2013 and risk losing to Lauren Boebert\u2026 Boebert won by only 546 votes in 2022. We cannot afford to give up any ground. **That\u2019s why I am launching an Emergency Midnight Fundraising Goal of raising another $30,000 to get us back on track to beating Boebert and flipping this seat blue.** **I\u2019m counting on grassroots donors like you if we\u2019re going to win: Please, will you make a donation right now to my campaign to help me defeat Lauren Boebert and take back the House for Democrats?** _Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  Lauren Boebert is a national embarrassment, but with your help now, we canfinally fire her.Let\u2019s finish this campaign strong!Thank you,Trisha  ********Paid for by Trisha 4 ColoradoTrisha 4 Colorado PO Box 630633 Highlands Ranch, CO 80130Contributions or gifts to Trisha 4 Colorado are not tax deductible.This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.
