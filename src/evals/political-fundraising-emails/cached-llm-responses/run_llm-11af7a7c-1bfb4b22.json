That\u2019s the most important thing. Winning this race.                                                                                                                  Fellow Patriot,I have an important message that I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be sending you today. Injust a moment, I am going to ask you to make a contribution to my campaign forU.S. Senate. November 5th isdays away, and I\u2019d really appreciate the chance toexplain why this request \u2014 especially today \u2014 is so critically important.Here\u2019s the truth: Right now, we have a week of media buys to pay for \u2014 themost important week of the entire campaign. And if we don\u2019t raise what we neednow, we will be forced to give up the airwaves and let Adam Schiff and theDemocrat-machine backing him up run their attacks on me unopposed. Whatmatters most right now is that we do whatever we can to fund a campaign thatcan win. That\u2019s the most important thing. Winning this race. Not just for thesake of winning, but because of what it would mean to substitute my presencewith Adam Schiff\u2019s in the Senate. That\u2019s a reality I don\u2019t think any of uswant to consider, but it\u2019s what will happen if we come up short. Now, time isrunning out. So, this is the part where I ask, one more time, and very humbly:Can you please use this link to make a donation to my campaign for U.S. Senatein California before Election Day? These emails are how we fund our campaign,and I really need you to chip in and help prevent us from falling behind.DONATE $35 DONATE $100 DONATE $500 DONATE $50 DONATE $250 DONATE $1000DONATE $35 DONATE $50 DONATE $100 DONATE $250 DONATE $500 DONATE $1000OTHER AMOUNT Thank you Fellow Patriot, and God bless, DONATE <> PAID FOR BYSTEVE GARVEY FOR U.S. SENATE PO Box 532389 Los Angeles, CA 90053-2389Unsubscribe here"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "STEVE GARVEY FOR U.S. SENATE", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 16:12:05"}
