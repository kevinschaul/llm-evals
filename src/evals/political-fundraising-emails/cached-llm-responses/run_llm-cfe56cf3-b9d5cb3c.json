We've launched SEVEN TV ads so far! Click here to watch our latest ad. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_q42024_mcf-tvad4?amount=&amounts;=,,,,] \ud83d\udcfa From doctors explaining the terrible consequences of the abortion ban, to real Missourians sharing their stories on why an abortion was the right decision for them \u2013 these ads are influential. But right now, we're dangerously close to having to pull them off the air\u2026 We're less than 3 days from the election, so slowing down right now could be the difference between ending the total abortion ban, or allowing anti-abortion politicians to continue restricting our freedoms.
