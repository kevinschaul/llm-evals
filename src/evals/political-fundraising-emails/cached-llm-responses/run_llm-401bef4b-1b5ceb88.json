I\u2019ve got a problem: Jared\u2019s been reallybusy with \u201cthe most consequential election of our lifetime in just 3 days\u201d (noidea what that means) , and so he hasn\u2019t been giving me as much attention asusual. \ud83e\udd7a Will you help give Jared an amazing fundraising day so he can focusless on fundraising for his final get-out-the-vote effort, and more on givingme pets? [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_jm_fr_q42024?] \ud83d\ude0d Chip in(extra treats?) \u2192 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_jm_fr_q42024?] Ipersonally think Jared should spend all his time at home with me. But Iunderstand that when he\u2019s not here, he\u2019s fighting for democracy, reproductiverights, healthcare, and preventing gun violence. I also keep hearing him saythat he\u2019s in the #1 battleground House seat in Florida, and that to take backthe House and enact the Harris-Walz agenda, he has to win. I don\u2019t know whatany of that means, but I do know that Jared needs your help to do his job. AndI want him to be happy and spend more time with me. So please, can you throwhim a bone and make a donation of any size?[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_jm_fr_q42024?] If you've saved paymentinformation with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:CHIP IN $10 \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_jm_fr_q42024?express_lane=true&amount;=10]CHIP IN $25 \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_jm_fr_q42024?express_lane=true&amount;=25]CHIP IN $50 \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_jm_fr_q42024?express_lane=true&amount;=50]CHIP IN $100 \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_jm_fr_q42024?express_lane=true&amount;=100]CHIP IN $250 \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_jm_fr_q42024?express_lane=true&amount;=250]CHIP IN OTHER \u2192 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_jm_fr_q42024] Ok Igotta go, I see a bird I need to chase.
