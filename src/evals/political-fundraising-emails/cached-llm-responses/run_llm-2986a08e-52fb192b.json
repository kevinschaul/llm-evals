We are always struggling against systems of mass incarceration, ofextreme income inequality, of late stage capitalism. Those conditions doexist. But one thing that I think is important is that we must mobilize for anaffirmative vision for this country \u2014 we can\u2019t just mobilize on fear. We needto be clear about what the stakes are. We do. But I don\u2019t believe in a \u2018fearonly\u2019 approach. I\u2019ll tell you what I believe: I believe in a bare minimum. $15minimum wage needed to be passed several years ago. I believe in guaranteed,improved, and expanded Medicare to every single American. We can\u2019t give up.I\u2019ve been in that place when I was a waitress. I did spend some time giving upand being cynical and saying, \u201cF*ck this.\u201d And you know what it got us?Nothing. Depression, cynicism, and a sense of purposelessness. Giving up is aprivilege that people just can\u2019t afford. Movements wax and wane. And there aretimes when it feels like our power is waning, and it\u2019s really easy to take ourball and go home. But the strength of a movement really depends on thedurability of it, and the commitment to it. That black pill of cynicism is thedeath of movements, not the birth of them.
