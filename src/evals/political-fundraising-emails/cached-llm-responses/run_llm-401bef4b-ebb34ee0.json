Wade a \u201csuccess\u201d. * He voted against expanding Title X funding, whichprovides essential reproductive healthcare like ultrasounds and affordablecontraception. * He voted against lowering insurance premiums and prescriptioncosts, capping the price of life-saving medication, and cutting hospital fees.* In Congress, he would have the power to enact this dangerous agenda on anational level. In contrast, I\u2019m dedicated to building a future that protectsabortion rights, lowers costs for families, and provides affordable healthcarefor everyone. To create that future and fight back against my opponent\u2019s scaryagenda, I need your help. Can you donate today to help us meet our end-of-month goal this Halloween?
