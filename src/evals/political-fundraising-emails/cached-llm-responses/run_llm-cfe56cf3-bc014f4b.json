I\u2019ve really enjoyed hitting the campaign trail and meeting with voters who are fired up and ready to win this race. We\u2019re one step closer to flipping OR-05 and taking back the House. But here's the bad news : We\u2019re up against millions of dollars in spending by deep-pocketed Republicans. My opponent, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, is backed by Republican special interest groups who are willing to spend whatever it takes to hold this seat. As they put more money into this race, we need a flood of support to fight back and make sure we\u2019re not getting drowned out on the airwaves. That's why I'm personally asking: Will you split a donation between Tina Kotek and me today to help us keep our ads on the air and continue to reach undecided voters? With everything we\u2019re up against, we can\u2019t afford to fall short. Not when this race could decide control of the House. \u2192 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?] If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your split donation to Janelle Bynum and Tina Kotek will go through immediately: CHIP IN $10 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?express_lane=true&amount;=10] CHIP IN $25 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?express_lane=true&amount;=25] CHIP IN $50 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?express_lane=true&amount;=50] CHIP IN $100 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?express_lane=true&amount;=100] CHIP IN $250 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?express_lane=true&amount;=250] ANOTHER AMOUNT [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum] Thank you, Janelle Tina for Oregon PO Box 42307 Portland, OR 97242 tinafororegon.com [https://www.tinafororegon.com/] | info@tinafororegon.com [info@tinafororegon.com] Paid for by Friends of Tina Kotek This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com .
