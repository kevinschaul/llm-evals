The only way Trisha can fight back and finally put an end to Boebert\u2019s embarrassing political \u201ccareer\u201d is with support from grassroots donors like you now. In 2022, Lauren Boebert only won by 546 votes. It was the closest race in the entire country. So we need grassroots donors like you to give every dollar you can spare now if Democratic nominee Trisha Calvarese is going to beat Boebert and take back the House for Democrats. **This seat could be the difference between taking back the House or letting Republicans stay in control. But Trisha\u2019s not taking a dime from corporate PACs, so we\u2019ve got nowhere else to turn:** **Please, will you make a donation now \u2013 every single dollar you can afford \u2013 to help Trisha Calvarese defeat Lauren Boebert, turn this seat blue, and take back the House for Democrats?** _Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  We\u2019re so grateful that you\u2019re a part of this campaign.Thank you,Team Trisha  ********Paid for by Trisha 4 ColoradoTrisha 4 Colorado PO Box 630633 Highlands Ranch, CO 80130Contributions or gifts to Trisha 4 Colorado are not tax deductible.This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.
