"BREAKING: A federal judge is now considering… ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏  Dear Friend, On October 22, a federal judge decreed that I had 7days to hand over my home in New York – as well as my only car and sentimentalkeepsakes and heartfelt gifts that I collected over the span of 80 years. Ithought that would be the end of the damage… But with the election rightaround the corner, Kamala’s Deep State truly wants to ruin me with all they’vegot. They’re now considering dealing one final blow to me. A judge may noworder me to give up my remaining home in Florida – my primary residence. As mylawyer inquired: do they truly want me homeless? Over the last few days, we’veheard ridiculous claims about President Trump being a “fascist.” Let me tellyou what fascism is… Fascism is weaponizing the legal system to punish yourpolitical opponents. Fascism is having your home taken from you. Fascism istaking the law license away from your opponent’s lawyer. Fascism is trying toturn your enemies into political prisoners. I am living through theDemocrats’ fascism right now. I sincerely pray that freedom, justice, and thetruth prevail on Tuesday, November 5 – or the damage done to me will spreadlike wildfire to the rest of our great Republic. But, as I wrote to you in anearlier letter, the Bible reminds us that our earthly possessions will alwaysfade, but greater “heavenly treasures” await us. The pursuit of truth,freedom, and justice are worth infinitely more than a car or a home.Possessions come and go, but I couldNEVER SURRENDER my fight for freedom andfor what I know to betrue. I would be tone deaf if I didn’t acknowledge thattimes are tough right now for all Americans, not just me, so please stopreading here if you cannot give at this time. But funding my Legal DefenseTrust is my last remaining hope of fighting for my freedom and for the libertyand justice of all Americans. So, if you can, and, seriously, only if you can,please make a contribution to my Legal Defense Trust – the Rudy GiulianiFreedom Fund – as I keep fighting for my freedom and justice as Kamala’s DeepState tries to JAIL me for life.
