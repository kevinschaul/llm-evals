The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a complaint alleging a compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel leak from a Luxfer Type 4 CNG 60 diesel gallon equivalent (DGE) 26x108 size fuel container.¬† The container was used in a system built and installed by Natural Gas Fuel Systems, LLC, dba Cummins Clean Fuel Technologies (CCFT).¬† A strong odor alerted the driver of the fuel leak, which occurred at a fracture at the fuel container's threaded aluminum alloy fixed end boss.The fuel container is positioned longitudinally within an enclosure structure that is attached to the truck's passenger side frame rail in a side-mount configuration. The fuel container is held in position relative to the enclosure structure via neck mounting blocks and two aluminum alloy end bosses, each at opposite ends of the fuel container. The threaded fixed end boss is securely held in position, while the other floating end boss has some degree of freedom to allow for normal expansion and contraction with internal pressure and temperature changes. The complainant reports they are aware of five other trucks purchased by other customers from the same dealership that have experienced the same alleged condition. Furthermore, previous discussions with CCFT have revealed that they are also aware of other similar incidents.A fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source may result in a fire or explosion. To better understand the frequency, severity and scope of the alleged  condition, a Preliminary Evaluation (PE) is being opened.

On June 3, 2022, the OÔ¨Éce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened Preliminary Evaluation PE22005 after the agency received VOQs and several Ô¨Åeld reports concerning the Auto Idle Stop (AIS) feature on 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles. The complaints allege that the engine fails to restart on its own from a complete stop at a traÔ¨Éc light or road intersection with the AIS function engaged. The subject vehicles are equipped with a 3.5L engine with a 9-speed automatic transmission.On January 6, 2023, Honda released service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009. These service bulletins address the failure to restart issue in the 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles, as well as the 2015-2020 Acura TLX, 2016-2020 Acura MDX, 2019-2022 Honda Passport, and 2020-2023 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.The repair outlined in the service bulletins is a two-stage countermeasure to remedy the issue. The first stage is a Programmed Fuel Injection (‚ÄúPGM-FI‚Äù) software update. The second stage is only deployed if the software update fails to remedy the issue. The second stage, depending on the model and model year, consists of replacement of the starter assembly, starter relays, and a valve adjustment. Additionally, Honda extended the warranty coverage to 10 years with unlimited mileage for vehicles requiring the second stage component replacement.ODI continues to receive complaints of the AIS failure to restart, with many complainants alleging the campaign countermeasures had been completed.  NHTSA has reviewed Honda's Information Request Letter responses involving warranty claims, lawsuits, and consumer complaints in addition to ODI's own data.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further consider the potential safety defect, including gathering additional data regarding Honda‚Äôs service campaign efficacy. ODI is additionally expanding the scope to encompass all vehicles addressed in Honda‚Äôs service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009 as well as newer model year vehicles, which are substantially similar to the vehicles covered by the service campaign.
