"Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Fuel Leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a complaint alleging a compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel leak from a Luxfer Type 4 CNG 60 diesel gallon equivalent (DGE) 26x108 size fuel container.  The container was used in a system built and installed by Natural Gas Fuel Systems, LLC, dba Cummins Clean Fuel Technologies (CCFT).  A strong odor alerted the driver of the fuel leak, which occurred at a fracture at the fuel container's threaded aluminum alloy fixed end boss.The fuel container is positioned longitudinally within an enclosure structure that is attached to the truck's passenger side frame rail in a side-mount configuration. The fuel container is held in position relative to the enclosure structure via neck mounting blocks and two aluminum alloy end bosses, each at opposite ends of the fuel container. The threaded fixed end boss is securely held in position, while the other floating end boss has some degree of freedom to allow for normal expansion and contraction with internal pressure and temperature changes. The complainant reports they are aware of five other trucks purchased by other customers from the same dealership that have experienced the same alleged condition. Furthermore, previous discussions with CCFT have revealed that they are also aware of other similar incidents.A fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source may result in a fire or explosion. To better understand the frequency, severity and scope of the alleged  condition, a Preliminary Evaluation (PE) is being opened.

"No Restart After Auto Start/Stop Engages

On June 3, 2022, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened Preliminary Evaluation PE22005 after the agency received VOQs and several ﬁeld reports concerning the Auto Idle Stop (AIS) feature on 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles. The complaints allege that the engine fails to restart on its own from a complete stop at a traﬃc light or road intersection with the AIS function engaged. The subject vehicles are equipped with a 3.5L engine with a 9-speed automatic transmission.On January 6, 2023, Honda released service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009. These service bulletins address the failure to restart issue in the 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles, as well as the 2015-2020 Acura TLX, 2016-2020 Acura MDX, 2019-2022 Honda Passport, and 2020-2023 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.The repair outlined in the service bulletins is a two-stage countermeasure to remedy the issue. The first stage is a Programmed Fuel Injection (“PGM-FI”) software update. The second stage is only deployed if the software update fails to remedy the issue. The second stage, depending on the model and model year, consists of replacement of the starter assembly, starter relays, and a valve adjustment. Additionally, Honda extended the warranty coverage to 10 years with unlimited mileage for vehicles requiring the second stage component replacement.ODI continues to receive complaints of the AIS failure to restart, with many complainants alleging the campaign countermeasures had been completed.  NHTSA has reviewed Honda's Information Request Letter responses involving warranty claims, lawsuits, and consumer complaints in addition to ODI's own data.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further consider the potential safety defect, including gathering additional data regarding Honda’s service campaign efficacy. ODI is additionally expanding the scope to encompass all vehicles addressed in Honda’s service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009 as well as newer model year vehicles, which are substantially similar to the vehicles covered by the service campaign.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the rear view camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Engineering Analysis (EA) is being opened to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"Crash incidents during Actually Smart Summon sessions

Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon are features on certain Tesla vehicles that allow a user to remotely move the vehicle to the user or to another designated location, through use of a phone app. The Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 1 complaint (VOQ) alleging that an Actually Smart Summon session resulted in a crash and has reviewed at least 3 media reports of apparently similar crashes. All four incidents involve the subject Tesla vehicles operating in Actually Smart Summon failing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash. Actually Smart Summon replaced Smart Summon and provided users with extended vehicle operating range while expanding vehicle connectivity through phone app live camera feeds and increased user latency experience. ODI has received 12 Smart Summon related VOQs alleging crash typology similar to the crashes experienced by users of Actually Smart Summon during sessions with little time for operators to react. ODI is aware of multiple crash allegations, involving both Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon, where the user had too little reaction time to avoid a crash, either with the available line of sight or releasing the phone app button, which stops the vehicle’s movement. Tesla has not reported any Smart Summon or Actually Smart Summon crashes through the Standing General Order for crashes involving ADS or Level 2 ADAS, which requires reporting of crashes on publicly accessible roads. ODI is opening this preliminary evaluation to investigate Actually Smart Summon’s capabilities as they relate to the subject and similar crashes, including the system's operation and ﬁeld performance in FSD equipped vehicles and vehicles included in free trial offers. NHTSA will evaluate the top speed that a vehicle can attain while Actually Smart Summon is engaged, designed-in operating restrictions for usage on public roads, and line of sight requirements. NHTSA expects this preliminary evaluation to include review of remote vehicle control through the phone app at various distances and lines of sight, including app connectivity delays resulting in increased stopping distance and the ability to utilize Actually Smart Summon in roadway environments or operating conditions for which the current version of the system is neither intended nor designed.  To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identiﬁcation Number document, go to NHTSA.gov. nan

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received twenty-three complaints alleging excessive frame flex on model year 2017-2023 Grand Design fifth wheel recreational trailers, models Momentum and Solitude. Twenty-two of the complaints allege that excessive frame flex resulted in a cargo or entry door opening while in transit, some with objects lost on roadways, while six complaints also state that slideouts extended out partially.  ODI has been in contact with both Grand Design and Lippert, the frame manufacturer. Grand Design believes that some frame flex, generally considered to be vertical movement in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel, is normal. However, Grand Design has developed a technical service bulletin (TSB), to evaluate concerns of excessive frame flex, defined as vertical movement greater than 3/8 inch. Per Grand Design, the frame flex is only occurring in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel and is resulting in cosmetic defects such as moving sidewalls, damage to cabinets, binding doors, etc. However, Lippert believes that the effects of frame flex may also extend back to the front axle of the trailer.  While Lippert provides frames for multiple trailer manufacturers, the majority of complaints are for these Grand Design products.Cargo and entry doors that open and slideouts that extend while in transit increase the risk of injury or a crash.

"Semi-Trailer Side Underride Guards

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a petition from Eric Hein, Director of the Institute for Safer Trucking dated July 3, 2024, requesting an investigation of all van-type (also known as box) semi-trailers due to collisions with passenger vehicles and other vulnerable road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists) resulting in significant injuries or death due to the lack of side underride guards (SUGs). On August 26, 2024, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP24004 to evaluate the petitioner’s request. No trailer manufacturer or equipment supplier was identified as the specific subject of the petition. The petition itself can be reviewed at NHTSA.gov under ODI Number 11599188.Currently, a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) requiring side underride guards on semi-trailers does not exist. The petitioner contends that a failure to include side underride guards equates to a safety defect in the semi-trailer’s design, construction and performance. ODI was petitioned in 2021 for this same issue and, after evaluation, denied the request (DP21004). The petitioner here states that evidence of SUG effectiveness to prevent fatalities and mitigate serious injuries “has continued to accumulate” since the denial of DP21004. The petitioner also alleges that “[d]espite a high severity of risk resulting in frequent severe or fatal injuries from side underride crashes, NHTSA has taken no action to investigate recalling semi-trailers without SUGs.”Pursuant to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), NHTSA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that summarized and requested comment on a 2022 NHTSA report with an analysis of potential effects of a requirement for side underride guards on new trailers and semitrailers. 88 Fed. Reg. 24536 (Apr. 21, 2023). NHTSA’s Office of Rulemaking is currently reviewing over 2,000 comments received. Also pursuant to the IIJA, on June 18, 2024, the NHTSA-facilitated Advisory Committee on Underride Protection (ACUP) issued its biennial report to Congress and the Secretary of Transportation. This biennial report consists of a majority report and a minority report summarizing its work to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on safety regulations related to underride crashes that have caused severe injury and death. Though the committee’s charter was extended through June 2025, the committee concluded its work following the publication of the biennial report in June 2024.In addition, NHTSA previously announced several actions related to truck trailer underride safety, including improving data collection of underride crashes by recommending inclusion of underride data in state crash data systems and by providing educational materials to state and local police departments on identifying and recording underride crashes. ODI also actively participates in the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) events where it has encouraged law enforcement to report underride crashes, and proposed CVSA focus on underride guards during the 2024 Operation Road Check, a nationwide 72-hour safety blitz. NHTSA is, further, conducting research on rear impact guard designs that better protect occupants of passenger vehicles in even more rear underride crash scenarios. And NHTSA, with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, published a pamphlet in August 2022—which was distributed to law enforcement through various channels—that explains how to identify and record such crashes (this pamphlet is available at https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/les/2022-08/Underride-Crash- Pamphlet_071522_v6atag.pdf).ODI searched its databases and found no injury or fatality trend specific to any make, model, or model year trailer within Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) and Early Warning Reporting (EWR) data and found one EWR report of vulnerable road user injury or fatalities. ODI also met, separately, with Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. (UTM) and Auto Haulers Association of America regarding UTM’s SUG and to better understand the operational environment of low clearance vehicles, respectively. Based on the information available to the agency, trailer manufacturers continue to pursue side underride guard technology, and at least one manufacturer is currently offering an optional guard.The petitioner submitted two documents to ODI on September 11, 2024. The first was a letter from UTM to Marianne Karth (Petitioner of DP21004 & DP22004) which recounted UTM’s testing of SUGs. The second document was an information sheet generated by the petitioner contesting UTM’s claims. The petitioner also submitted certain documents to ODI on October 1, 2024, which the petitioner had previously submitted separately as part of comments on a collection of information pertaining to Reporting and Documents About Potential Defects (Docket No. NHTSA-2024-0055). This included 45 files regarding 49 unique crashes. ODI reviewed that information and found that of the 49 crashes, twenty-nine (29) potentially involved a subject vehicle. The majority of the 45 files were from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a NHTSA-maintained database of state crash data comprised of certain, albeit often relatively limited information. Notably, of the 29 files, only 2 included the make, model, and model year of the subject vehicle.After consideration of the petition, including the reports and documents provided by the petitioner, NHTSA believes the issues raised here are best addressed through its recent rulemaking and the ongoing actions under IIJA. Accordingly, NHTSA has decided not to open a defect investigation, and the petition is denied. The denial of this petition does not foreclose the agency from taking further action if warranted or making a future finding that a safety-related defect exists based upon additional information the agency may receive.nan

"Trailer Hitch Receiver Structure may Crack and Separate

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 5 complaints for various 2016-2022 Thor Motor Coach motorhomes alleging that the trailer hitch receiver (""hitch"") or recreational vehicle (RV) frame cracked and/or separated, including one which resulted in the towed item detaching and causing property damage. Other examples of hitch or frame cracking have been discovered prior to hitch separation.ODI has contacted the RV manufacturer, Thor, the frame extension manufacturer, Mor-Ryde, and the hitch manufacturer, Lippert, who, in response, allege that consumers are overloading the hitch. While the amount that a motorhome can tow must be calculated after determining the cargo, passenger and liquids weights, the hitch that failed had an 8,000lb limit and the vehicle it was flat-towing weighed approximately 4,000lbs.Hitch or frame cracking resulting in the towed item detaching and becoming loose on the roadway increases the risk of a crash to others on the roadway.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to determine whether an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety exists.

"Engine Stall With Intermittent Restart

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 80 consumer complaints alleging an engine stall and loss of motive power on model year (MY) 2022 RAM 1500 pickup trucks and 2022 Jeep Wagoneer SUV vehicles. The particular engines in the subject vehicles are equipped with the Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group LLC (FCA) 5.7L Hemi eTorque system. The eTorque system is a mild hybrid system that lets the vehicle partially power itself. It accomplishes this by converting the captured energy from the braking system into electricity for the battery pack, which is then used to power a variety of electrical components. ETorque engines replace the alternator with a 48-volt battery-powered belt drive and a motor generator. The motor generator provides extra torque to the crankshaft during gear changes. Simultaneously, the motor generator uses the 48-volt battery pack to increase torque. Many of the complaints state that the vehicle's engine would shut off, often while travelling at slow speed, the vehicle would shift into park and apply the emergency brake. The vehicles were sometimes able to be restarted. In addition, complaints state that the malfunction warning light with the battery fault symbol appeared on the dash.  Many complaints state that a low voltage condition fault is present, sometimes not being able to restart the vehicle. On April 13, 2023, FCA announced recall 23V-265 describing a defect in certain 2021 Ram 1500 vehicles equipped with 5.7L eTorque engines.  The recall described a defect in the powertrain control module software can cause an incorrect fuel mixture condition in the engine, and result in an engine stall. In February of 2024, ODI provided the complaints on the 2022 Ram 1500 and Wagoneer vehicles to FCA. After reviewing the complaints, FCA stated that “the loss of motive power was likely not caused by an over rich fuel condition (as outlined in recall 23V-265), but rather some other cause (e.g., an electrical concern that causes the engine to shut down).”   A Preliminary Evaluation has been opened to assess the scope, frequency, root cause(s) and consequences of these loss/stall of motive power incidents.  Additionally, ODI may expand the scope of the subject population during the investigation, if needed.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.RQ24011 is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25003) to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the Rear View Camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

The affected vehicles by these recalls included model years (MY) 2021 through 2023 Volkswagen ID.4 vehicles. ODI received reports of the vehicle’s doors opening while the vehicle was in motion post recall remedy.  ODI, also, received similar allegations on vehicles that were outside the scope of the recalls.Volkswagen issued recall 23V-213 on March 29, 2023, and recall 23V-213 on May 03, 2023. These recalls addressed the defect of water ingress into the circuit board assembly of the door handle. Water ingress can cause communication issues between the door handle and the door control until. This malfunction resulted in the vehicle door inadvertently opening while the vehicle was in motion.Over the course of the investigation, ODI received 17 unique VIN VOQ complaints of the vehicle doors opening while the vehicle was in motion occurring either post recall remedy or on a vehicle that was outside the recall scope. Volkswagen submitted 190 unique VIN complaints reporting the same circumstances.   On September 4, 2024, Volkswagen submitted recall 24V-651 to address the issue of inadvertent opening of the door while the vehicle is in motion. The scope of this recall expands the affected vehicles to include all MY2021-2024 Volkswagen ID.4 models, including those remedied under the subject recalls. The recall remedy consists of replacement of the door handle assembly on all four doors as well as a software update.  The software update is performed to update the door handle parameters. The new door handle will have the membrane relocated to the back of the handle to avoid standing water within the handle.  Also, a protective coating will be on the front and back of the circuit board to avoid direct moisture formation.  In view of the action being taken by Volkswagen, Recall 24V-651, ODI is closing this Recall Query.  The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.To review the ODI reports cited in the Closing Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan

"Unexpected ADS behavior

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received reports of 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles equipped with Waymo’s 5th generation automated driving system (ADS) wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle was the sole vehicle operated during a collision or wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle exhibited driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws. Reports include collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains, collisions with parked vehicles, and instances in which the ADS appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices. In certain incidents, a collision occurred shortly after the ADS exhibited unexpected behavior near traffic safety control devices. Waymo submitted incident reports involving collisions to NHTSA under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO). Other incidents, such as vehicles driving in opposing lanes with nearby oncoming traffic or entering construction zones, were identified based on publicly available reports.Based on initial evaluation of these incidents, NHTSA understands that the Waymo ADS was either engaged throughout the incident or, in certain cases when supervised by an in-vehicle test driver, the ADS disengaged in the moments just before an incident occurred.ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation to investigate the Waymo 5th Generation ADS’s performance in the incidents identified in this resume and similar scenarios, as well as to more closely assess any commonalities in these incidents. The investigation will evaluate the ADS’s performance in detecting and responding to traffic control devices and in avoiding collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects and vehicles.    The SGO reports cited in the Opening Resume can be found by report identifiers listed below on NHTSA's SGO website: https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting#dataSGO 2021-01 report IDs:30270-116030270-122030270-149430270-436330270-508130270-531830270-575830270-613330270-654830270-656130270-683830270-698130270-704830270-705430270-705830270-730830270-731230270-7534nan

"Rear-end Collisions Involving Zoox Vehicles

On May 10, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24015) to assess reports of sudden unexpected braking in Zoox vehicles, leading to rear-end collisions, as well as to evaluate the performance of the Zoox Automated Driving System in crosswalks around vulnerable road users and in other similar rear-end collision scenarios. These unexpected braking events can increase the risk of a collision. To assess these risks, ODI collected information from Zoox as part of this investigation. In response to ODI’s Request for Information, Zoox provided information describing hard braking events commanded by the ADS. These hard braking events were identified by certain thresholds, including rate of deceleration. ODI analyzed the hard braking events commanded by the Zoox ADS and determined that Zoox ADS-equipped vehicles contributed to 4 collisions. Each of these collisions involved a vulnerable road user, with three of the incidents resulting in injury. Three of the collisions were reported under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), while the other collision was not reportable under the SGO.On March 13, 2025, Zoox ﬁled a safety recall (NHTSA Recall No. 25E019) stating that in specific circumstances “the Zoox ADS software may have reacted over-cautiously and braked unnecessarily hard” and that “the Zoox ADS software may have incorrectly anticipated a collision and braked unnecessarily hard.” These behaviors could lead to increased risk of a rear-end collision caused by unnecessary hard braking. The Zoox recall report indicated that Zoox's ADS has been remedied through a software update that addresses the described defects. As of November 7, 2024, the updated software was released to all impacted Zoox vehicles.In view of the recall action taken by Zoox and ODI’s analysis of the available data, including data presented by Zoox demonstrating a resolution of these hard braking incidents after the software update, ODI is closing this Preliminary Evaluation. NHTSA reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by new circumstances.To review the SGO reports cited above, go to NHTSA.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting.  The SGO report ID numbers are provided below:30610-7578     30610-7589     30610-4810    nan

The Office of Defect Investigations (ODI) has received 27 complaints alleging diesel fuel leaks due to a fracture in the secondary fuel filter housing in model year (MY) 2015-2021 Ford Motor Company (Ford) F-250, 350, 450, and 550 Super Duty vehicles equipped with 6.7L diesel engines. Of these complaints, 12 describe an engine compartment fire. The proximity of the secondary fuel filter to high heat sources creates a potential for autoignition thermal events and fires. ODI has contacted the vehicle manufacturer, Ford, and the filter manufacturer, Allevard Sogefi USA (Sogefi), and learned that the low-pressure fuel system is capable of a maximum operating pressure of 8.5 Bar, while the secondary fuel filter is only tested to seven (7) Bar during the manufacturing process. Additionally, changes starting in 2022 by both Ford and Sogefi align with a lack of similar complaints on MY 2022 and newer vehicles.  ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related problems.

"Inadvertent Automatic Emergency Braking

On May 8, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24013 to investigate reports of inadvertent activation of the automatic emergency braking (AEB) system in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. (Fisker). The complaints allege the activation of AEB without an apparent roadway obstruction in the vehicle’s forward path, resulting in sudden vehicle deceleration. This sudden deceleration occurs without adequate warning or input from the driver. The braking applications range from momentary, partial application resulting in rapid loss of speed to full application, which brings the vehicle to a complete stop in the travel lane.ODI sent Fisker an Information Request (IR) letter on May 20, 2024. On June 17 and 19, 2024, Fisker and its affiliates filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Fisker provided an incomplete response to the IR on July 1, 2024. Limited information pertaining to system validation and failure data was provided. Fisker subsequently requested more time to provide additional responsive files due to limited available resources. Fisker sent additional responsive files on September 9, 2024, September 17, 2024, and December 16, 2024, but Fisker’s response did not contain sufficient information for ODI to fully evaluate the alleged safety defect.Further, on December 27, 2024, the Fisker employees with whom ODI had been corresponding informed ODI that all Fisker employees were being “dismissed” as of that date. ODI therefore does not anticipate receiving any further responsive submissions such that it can fully evaluate the reports that led to this investigation. ODI performed phone interviews and sent a survey to consumers to obtain more information and validate the allegations. Additionally, ODI reviewed allegations of the alleged safety defect that were submitted to various online forums. Most of these reports were similar in nature to the reports received by ODI. Some of the reports in online forums appear to be duplicative reports that were also submitted to ODI. Based on the responses received and analysis of similar online reporting, there was no clear trend in the following factors pertaining to the allegations: reoccurrence of events (i.e., single or multiple incidents), speed immediately prior to the event, whether the event concluded in a reduction of speed or a full stop, roadway conditions, and warning immediately prior to the event.To date, between the reports provided by Fisker and complaints made directly to the agency, ODI is aware of over 20 reports alleging inadvertent AEB activation. Before the employees were dismissed, Fisker’s testing done in response to the inadvertent AEB allegations reportedly did not result in any inadvertent AEB activations. The “Manufacturer” and “Total” counts in the above table have been left blank because of a pending request for confidential treatment by Fisker that could not be timely addressed given the company’s status. This information factored into ODI’s investigation and analysis.The available information does not warrant further action at this time.  The closing of this investigation does not constitute a finding by NHTSA that a safety-related defect does not exist. Additionally, the Agency notes that the Vehicle Safety Act states: “A manufacturer’s filing of a petition in bankruptcy under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title 11 does not negate the manufacturer’s duty to comply with section 30112 or sections 30115 through 30120 of this title,” which include the recall provisions of the Act. The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Recall 23V838 Remedy Effectiveness

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is opening a Recall Query to assess the remedy adequacy of Recall 23V838. On December 12, 2023, Tesla filed a Defect Information Report (Recall 23V838) applicable to all Tesla models produced and equipped with any version of its Autopilot system, which Tesla described as an SAE Level 2 (L2) Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Autopilot is the simultaneous engagement of Tesla’s Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) and Autosteer. In describing the safety defect, Tesla’s Defect Information Report (DIR) explained that “the prominence and scope of the system’s controls may be insufficient to prevent driver misuse,” and Tesla committed to the deployment of a multipart remedy aimed at improving system and engagement controls and reducing mode confusion.EA22002 (upgraded from PE21020) was opened to investigate whether Tesla’s Autopilot contained a defect that created an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety and involved extensive crash analysis, human factors analysis, vehicle evaluations, and assessment of vehicle control authority and driver engagement technologies. The work conducted in these investigations aligns with Tesla’s conclusion in its 23V838 recall filing. During EA22002, ODI identified at least 13 crashes involving one or more fatalities and many more involving serious injuries in which foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.  Tesla filed Recall 23V838 to address concerns regarding the Autopilot system investigated in EA22002. Following deployment of the remedy in Recall 23V838, ODI identified concerns due to post-remedy crash events and results from preliminary NHTSA tests of remedied vehicles. Also, Tesla has stated that a portion of the remedy both requires the owner to opt in and allows a driver to readily reverse it. Tesla has also deployed non-remedy updates to address issues that appear related to ODI’s concerns under EA22002. This investigation will consider why these updates were not a part of the recall or otherwise determined to remedy a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk. ODI is therefore opening this Recall Query investigation to further evaluate the adequacy of the remedy for recall 23V838.nan

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Preliminary Evaluation is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25001) to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"Electronic Brake Module Component Failure

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received multiple Early Warning Reporting field reports alleging a loss of brake boost assist in MY2023 Cadillac LYRIQ vehicles. The reports allege a hard brake pedal, followed by a “Brake System Failure” message at start up or while driving. The EWR field reports have been verified by General Motors (GM). GM stated the electronic brake control module, also known as “eBoost”, has an internal spindle that can fracture during an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) event. GM further stated that due to the fracture, the vehicles can lose brake assist, experience speed limitation, and ABS would lose some functionality.GM indicated a new material clean break point was introduced in the assembly plants in May 2023.  GM has also developed an over the air (OTA) update, which will cycle the brake booster similarly to an ABS event at start-up for every key cycle. If the spindle fractures during this start-up cycling, a warning lamp will illuminate to prompt the customer to bring the vehicle to the dealership to be diagnosed and repaired under warranty.

"Under hood fires caused by fuel leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) reviewed Ford Motor Company’s (Ford’s) proposed remedy for recall 24V-187. ODI evaluated information from Ford concerning the recall remedy for the involved vehicles.Ford issued recall 24V-187 on March 8, 2024, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2022-2023 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022 Ford Escape vehicles equipped with 1.5L engines. Recall 24V-187 states that a fuel injector may crack resulting in liquid fuel and/or fuel vapor migration to, and accumulation near, ignition sources that may cause an under hood fire, fuel odor both outside and inside of the vehicle, and increase the risk of injury. Recall 24V-187 further states that a cracked fuel injector in the engine allows for fuel to leak at a high rate into the cylinder head, which can travel out via a drain hole and down onto hot surfaces on the exhaust and/or turbo system.The recall remedy for 24V-187 involves 1) an engine control software update and 2) installation of a drain tube. The engine control software update will detect a pressure drop in the fuel rail providing a “seek service” message within the vehicle’s instrument cluster, as well as invoke a strategy to disable the high-pressure fuel pump, de-rate engine power output, and reduce temperatures of possible ignition sources in the engine compartment. The drain tube will allow fuel to drain from the cylinder head hole to the ground below the vehicle away from surfaces which may initiate combustion. The recall remedy does not include replacement of the cracked fuel injector.On November 18, 2022, recall 22V-859 was issued involving MY 2020-2023 Ford Escape and MY 2021-2023 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles.

"Front Seat Belt Assemblies may be Missing the Rivet that Secures the Quick Connector and Wire Plate

On April 4, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened RQ24006 to investigate American Honda Motor Co.’s (Honda’s) proposed remedy for recall 23V-782 as well as scope of the vehicles involved.Honda issued recall 23V-782 on November 21, 2023, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2023-2024 Honda Accord, Honda Accord Hybrid, and Honda HR-V vehicles. Recall 23V-782 states that the driver and front passenger seat belt pretensioner assemblies may have been manufactured without a rivet that secures the pretensioner quick connector and wire plate. Recall documentation states that seat belt pretensioner assemblies that are missing the rivet will not properly restrain the occupant in the event of a collision, increasing the risk of injury.  Subject defective seat belt assemblies are installed as original equipment for both the driver and front passenger positions for the HR-V, but only for the driver position for the Accord and Accord Hybrid.The recall remedy for 23V-782 instructs the technician to inspect both front seat belt pretensioner assemblies and, if necessary, replace them. The inspection procedure requires the technician to utilize a pull force gauge to determine whether the subject component is missing the subject rivet and requires replacement. Parts requiring replacement are determined by whether the pretensioner quick connector separates from the pretensioner assembly while the technician is pulling on the seat belt. If no separation occurs, then the part is determined to be not defective and not require replacement.There have been no reports alleging a failure of seat belt pretensioner assemblies after the inspect and replace remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed. Additionally, no comparable failures have been observed in field data for similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall. As of the 4th quarter of 2024, the recall completion rate is at approximately 84% of the total recalled population.In view of the lack of failures after the remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed, and the lack of failures in similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ).

"Unintended Transmission Downshift

In September 2016, Ford Motor Company (Ford) issued safety recall 16V-248 which included certain model year (MY) 2011-2012 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions. This recall was in response to allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, increasing the risk of a crash and/or injury, and included approximately 153,581 vehicles. Ford identified the root cause of the unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear to be intermittent signal loss from the transmission’s Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor due to solder joint cracks on the OSS circuit board as a result of manufacturing process issues. The OSS sensor is mounted onto the molded lead frame and transmits changes in transmission shaft speed to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). The remedy program described in safety recall 16V-248 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring.In December 2017, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ17-010) to assess the scope and remedy effectiveness of safety recall 16V-248. As a result of this ODI investigation, Ford issued safety recall 19V-075 to expand the scope of 16V-248 to include MY 2011-2013 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions and included approximately 1,263,051 vehicles. The remedy program described in safety recall 19V-075 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring. In June 2019, Ford issued safety recall 19V-433 as the remedy program used to service MY 2013 Ford F-150 5.0L and 6.2L vehicles in accordance with safety recall 19V-075 did not contain the necessary updates to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 107,857 vehicles.On March 27, 2024, ODI opened this Recall Query (RQ24-005) to investigate the scope of the above-described safety recalls. At the time that this investigation was opened, ODI had received 86 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) reporting allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, in MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles. As a result of this Recall Query, Ford filled safety recall 24V-444 on June 14, 2024, to include MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles and expand the scope of safety recalls 16V-248, 19V-075 and 19V-433. The remedy program described in safety recall 24V-444 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 552,188 vehicles.In its May 2024 response to ODI’s information request, Ford concluded that a predominant root cause for the intermittent OSS signal loss has not been identified outside of the original safety recall (16V-248). Ford’s investigation also concluded that the primary causes of the defect in MY 2014 F-150 vehicles were related to the molded lead frame and the control assembly transmission main. In the May 2024 response, Ford identified 2,184 total reports that described unintended vehicle transmission downshifting and rear wheel lock-up events; 1,441 warranty claims and 743 reports from consumer complaints, field reports, consumer surveys, and lawsuits/legal claims. Note that the values presented here and in the table above represent the total number of reports which can include a single consumer with multiple reports of the same event as well as a consumer with reports of multiple distinct events. Of the 1,441 warranty claims, 551 warranty claims involved repair of the molded lead frame (38%) and 509 warranty claims involved repair of the control assembly transmission main (35%).Ford has also stated that the PCM programming used to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting was implemented starting with MY 2015 vehicle #1 production and onward.In view of the safety recall action being taken by Ford, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ24-005). The agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Fuel Leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a complaint alleging a compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel leak from a Luxfer Type 4 CNG 60 diesel gallon equivalent (DGE) 26x108 size fuel container.  The container was used in a system built and installed by Natural Gas Fuel Systems, LLC, dba Cummins Clean Fuel Technologies (CCFT).  A strong odor alerted the driver of the fuel leak, which occurred at a fracture at the fuel container's threaded aluminum alloy fixed end boss.The fuel container is positioned longitudinally within an enclosure structure that is attached to the truck's passenger side frame rail in a side-mount configuration. The fuel container is held in position relative to the enclosure structure via neck mounting blocks and two aluminum alloy end bosses, each at opposite ends of the fuel container. The threaded fixed end boss is securely held in position, while the other floating end boss has some degree of freedom to allow for normal expansion and contraction with internal pressure and temperature changes. The complainant reports they are aware of five other trucks purchased by other customers from the same dealership that have experienced the same alleged condition. Furthermore, previous discussions with CCFT have revealed that they are also aware of other similar incidents.A fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source may result in a fire or explosion. To better understand the frequency, severity and scope of the alleged  condition, a Preliminary Evaluation (PE) is being opened.

"No Restart After Auto Start/Stop Engages

On June 3, 2022, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened Preliminary Evaluation PE22005 after the agency received VOQs and several ﬁeld reports concerning the Auto Idle Stop (AIS) feature on 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles. The complaints allege that the engine fails to restart on its own from a complete stop at a traﬃc light or road intersection with the AIS function engaged. The subject vehicles are equipped with a 3.5L engine with a 9-speed automatic transmission.On January 6, 2023, Honda released service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009. These service bulletins address the failure to restart issue in the 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles, as well as the 2015-2020 Acura TLX, 2016-2020 Acura MDX, 2019-2022 Honda Passport, and 2020-2023 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.The repair outlined in the service bulletins is a two-stage countermeasure to remedy the issue. The first stage is a Programmed Fuel Injection (“PGM-FI”) software update. The second stage is only deployed if the software update fails to remedy the issue. The second stage, depending on the model and model year, consists of replacement of the starter assembly, starter relays, and a valve adjustment. Additionally, Honda extended the warranty coverage to 10 years with unlimited mileage for vehicles requiring the second stage component replacement.ODI continues to receive complaints of the AIS failure to restart, with many complainants alleging the campaign countermeasures had been completed.  NHTSA has reviewed Honda's Information Request Letter responses involving warranty claims, lawsuits, and consumer complaints in addition to ODI's own data.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further consider the potential safety defect, including gathering additional data regarding Honda’s service campaign efficacy. ODI is additionally expanding the scope to encompass all vehicles addressed in Honda’s service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009 as well as newer model year vehicles, which are substantially similar to the vehicles covered by the service campaign.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the rear view camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

The complainants allege activation of the AEB system with no apparent obstruction in the vehicle's path, resulting in rapid vehicle deceleration.Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 412 reports that may relate to the alleged defect. Honda provided analysis of the alleged defect and stated that some customers possibly had an inadequate understanding of the AEB system and its limitations. However, many consumer complaints received by ODI allege that Honda dealerships were unable to reproduce the condition or state that Honda dealerships informed the consumer that this is considered normal AEB operation.To date, ODI has received a total of 106 consumer complaints of inadvertent activation of AEB in the subject vehicles.  In total, ODI reviewed 475 reports involving vehicles with unique VINs that may relate to the alleged defect.

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Engineering Analysis (EA) is being opened to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

ODI has received 12 Smart Summon related VOQs alleging crash typology similar to the crashes experienced by users of Actually Smart Summon during sessions with little time for operators to react. ODI is aware of multiple crash allegations, involving both Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon, where the user had too little reaction time to avoid a crash, either with the available line of sight or releasing the phone app button, which stops the vehicle’s movement. Tesla has not reported any Smart Summon or Actually Smart Summon crashes through the Standing General Order for crashes involving ADS or Level 2 ADAS, which requires reporting of crashes on publicly accessible roads. ODI is opening this preliminary evaluation to investigate Actually Smart Summon’s capabilities as they relate to the subject and similar crashes, including the system's operation and ﬁeld performance in FSD equipped vehicles and vehicles included in free trial offers. NHTSA will evaluate the top speed that a vehicle can attain while Actually Smart Summon is engaged, designed-in operating restrictions for usage on public roads, and line of sight requirements. NHTSA expects this preliminary evaluation to include review of remote vehicle control through the phone app at various distances and lines of sight, including app connectivity delays resulting in increased stopping distance and the ability to utilize Actually Smart Summon in roadway environments or operating conditions for which the current version of the system is neither intended nor designed.  To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identiﬁcation Number document, go to NHTSA.gov. nan

"Loss of Motive Power

In January 2024, The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24002) to investigate allegations of loss of motive power in model year (MY) 2021 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles. In April 2024, Ford issued safety recall 24V-267 covering 456,565 MY 2021-2024 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022-2023 Ford Maverick vehicles. The recall addressed occurrences of loss of motive power resulting from sudden degradation of the 12V battery during the drive cycle. When the battery failure occurs, consumers may experience a complete loss of engine power without the ability to restart, accompanied by the loss of 12V accessories, including hazard lights. The recall remedy consists of software updates to the body control module and powertrain control module, which were designed to provide improved detection of the 12V battery state of charge during the drive cycle and provide warning to consumers if the battery is degraded.ODI has since received 15 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) describing loss of motive power incidents for MY 2021 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles that received the 24V-267 recall remedy. Consumers describe that prior to the loss of motive power, there were no warnings related to the 12V battery or vehicle electrical system. Additionally, multiple consumers reported that after the vehicle was towed to the dealership following the loss of motive power, the event was diagnosed to the 12V battery, and a battery replacement was the only required repair.ODI is opening this Recall Query on MY 2021-2024 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022-2023 Ford Maverick vehicles to assess the effectiveness of the 24V-267 recall remedy.

"Frame Flex on Grand Design Fifth Wheel Recreational Trailers

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received twenty-three complaints alleging excessive frame flex on model year 2017-2023 Grand Design fifth wheel recreational trailers, models Momentum and Solitude. Twenty-two of the complaints allege that excessive frame flex resulted in a cargo or entry door opening while in transit, some with objects lost on roadways, while six complaints also state that slideouts extended out partially.  ODI has been in contact with both Grand Design and Lippert, the frame manufacturer. Grand Design believes that some frame flex, generally considered to be vertical movement in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel, is normal. However, Grand Design has developed a technical service bulletin (TSB), to evaluate concerns of excessive frame flex, defined as vertical movement greater than 3/8 inch. Per Grand Design, the frame flex is only occurring in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel and is resulting in cosmetic defects such as moving sidewalls, damage to cabinets, binding doors, etc. However, Lippert believes that the effects of frame flex may also extend back to the front axle of the trailer.  While Lippert provides frames for multiple trailer manufacturers, the majority of complaints are for these Grand Design products.Cargo and entry doors that open and slideouts that extend while in transit increase the risk of injury or a crash. ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to determine whether an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety exists.To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan

"Semi-Trailer Side Underride Guards

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a petition from Eric Hein, Director of the Institute for Safer Trucking dated July 3, 2024, requesting an investigation of all van-type (also known as box) semi-trailers due to collisions with passenger vehicles and other vulnerable road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists) resulting in significant injuries or death due to the lack of side underride guards (SUGs). On August 26, 2024, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP24004 to evaluate the petitioner’s request. No trailer manufacturer or equipment supplier was identified as the specific subject of the petition. The petition itself can be reviewed at NHTSA.gov under ODI Number 11599188.Currently, a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) requiring side underride guards on semi-trailers does not exist. The petitioner contends that a failure to include side underride guards equates to a safety defect in the semi-trailer’s design, construction and performance. ODI was petitioned in 2021 for this same issue and, after evaluation, denied the request (DP21004). The petitioner here states that evidence of SUG effectiveness to prevent fatalities and mitigate serious injuries “has continued to accumulate” since the denial of DP21004. The petitioner also alleges that “[d]espite a high severity of risk resulting in frequent severe or fatal injuries from side underride crashes, NHTSA has taken no action to investigate recalling semi-trailers without SUGs.”Pursuant to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), NHTSA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that summarized and requested comment on a 2022 NHTSA report with an analysis of potential effects of a requirement for side underride guards on new trailers and semitrailers. 88 Fed. Reg. 24536 (Apr. 21, 2023). NHTSA’s Office of Rulemaking is currently reviewing over 2,000 comments received. Also pursuant to the IIJA, on June 18, 2024, the NHTSA-facilitated Advisory Committee on Underride Protection (ACUP) issued its biennial report to Congress and the Secretary of Transportation. This biennial report consists of a majority report and a minority report summarizing its work to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on safety regulations related to underride crashes that have caused severe injury and death. Though the committee’s charter was extended through June 2025, the committee concluded its work following the publication of the biennial report in June 2024.In addition, NHTSA previously announced several actions related to truck trailer underride safety, including improving data collection of underride crashes by recommending inclusion of underride data in state crash data systems and by providing educational materials to state and local police departments on identifying and recording underride crashes. ODI also actively participates in the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) events where it has encouraged law enforcement to report underride crashes, and proposed CVSA focus on underride guards during the 2024 Operation Road Check, a nationwide 72-hour safety blitz. NHTSA is, further, conducting research on rear impact guard designs that better protect occupants of passenger vehicles in even more rear underride crash scenarios. And NHTSA, with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, published a pamphlet in August 2022—which was distributed to law enforcement through various channels—that explains how to identify and record such crashes (this pamphlet is available at https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/les/2022-08/Underride-Crash- Pamphlet_071522_v6atag.pdf).ODI searched its databases and found no injury or fatality trend specific to any make, model, or model year trailer within Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) and Early Warning Reporting (EWR) data and found one EWR report of vulnerable road user injury or fatalities. ODI also met, separately, with Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. (UTM) and Auto Haulers Association of America regarding UTM’s SUG and to better understand the operational environment of low clearance vehicles, respectively. Based on the information available to the agency, trailer manufacturers continue to pursue side underride guard technology, and at least one manufacturer is currently offering an optional guard.The petitioner submitted two documents to ODI on September 11, 2024. The first was a letter from UTM to Marianne Karth (Petitioner of DP21004 & DP22004) which recounted UTM’s testing of SUGs. The second document was an information sheet generated by the petitioner contesting UTM’s claims. The petitioner also submitted certain documents to ODI on October 1, 2024, which the petitioner had previously submitted separately as part of comments on a collection of information pertaining to Reporting and Documents About Potential Defects (Docket No. NHTSA-2024-0055). This included 45 files regarding 49 unique crashes. ODI reviewed that information and found that of the 49 crashes, twenty-nine (29) potentially involved a subject vehicle. The majority of the 45 files were from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a NHTSA-maintained database of state crash data comprised of certain, albeit often relatively limited information. Notably, of the 29 files, only 2 included the make, model, and model year of the subject vehicle.After consideration of the petition, including the reports and documents provided by the petitioner, NHTSA believes the issues raised here are best addressed through its recent rulemaking and the ongoing actions under IIJA. Accordingly, NHTSA has decided not to open a defect investigation, and the petition is denied. The denial of this petition does not foreclose the agency from taking further action if warranted or making a future finding that a safety-related defect exists based upon additional information the agency may receive.nan

"Trailer Hitch Receiver Structure may Crack and Separate

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 5 complaints for various 2016-2022 Thor Motor Coach motorhomes alleging that the trailer hitch receiver (""hitch"") or recreational vehicle (RV) frame cracked and/or separated, including one which resulted in the towed item detaching and causing property damage. Other examples of hitch or frame cracking have been discovered prior to hitch separation.ODI has contacted the RV manufacturer, Thor, the frame extension manufacturer, Mor-Ryde, and the hitch manufacturer, Lippert, who, in response, allege that consumers are overloading the hitch. While the amount that a motorhome can tow must be calculated after determining the cargo, passenger and liquids weights, the hitch that failed had an 8,000lb limit and the vehicle it was flat-towing weighed approximately 4,000lbs.Hitch or frame cracking resulting in the towed item detaching and becoming loose on the roadway increases the risk of a crash to others on the roadway.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to determine whether an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety exists.

"Engine Stall With Intermittent Restart

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 80 consumer complaints alleging an engine stall and loss of motive power on model year (MY) 2022 RAM 1500 pickup trucks and 2022 Jeep Wagoneer SUV vehicles. The particular engines in the subject vehicles are equipped with the Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group LLC (FCA) 5.7L Hemi eTorque system. The eTorque system is a mild hybrid system that lets the vehicle partially power itself. It accomplishes this by converting the captured energy from the braking system into electricity for the battery pack, which is then used to power a variety of electrical components. ETorque engines replace the alternator with a 48-volt battery-powered belt drive and a motor generator. The motor generator provides extra torque to the crankshaft during gear changes. Simultaneously, the motor generator uses the 48-volt battery pack to increase torque. Many of the complaints state that the vehicle's engine would shut off, often while travelling at slow speed, the vehicle would shift into park and apply the emergency brake. The vehicles were sometimes able to be restarted. In addition, complaints state that the malfunction warning light with the battery fault symbol appeared on the dash.  Many complaints state that a low voltage condition fault is present, sometimes not being able to restart the vehicle. On April 13, 2023, FCA announced recall 23V-265 describing a defect in certain 2021 Ram 1500 vehicles equipped with 5.7L eTorque engines.  The recall described a defect in the powertrain control module software can cause an incorrect fuel mixture condition in the engine, and result in an engine stall. In February of 2024, ODI provided the complaints on the 2022 Ram 1500 and Wagoneer vehicles to FCA. After reviewing the complaints, FCA stated that “the loss of motive power was likely not caused by an over rich fuel condition (as outlined in recall 23V-265), but rather some other cause (e.g., an electrical concern that causes the engine to shut down).”   A Preliminary Evaluation has been opened to assess the scope, frequency, root cause(s) and consequences of these loss/stall of motive power incidents.  Additionally, ODI may expand the scope of the subject population during the investigation, if needed.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.RQ24011 is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25003) to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the Rear View Camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

"Inadvertent Door Opening

On May 16, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened Recall Query (RQ) RQ24010 to investigate the remedy and scope of recalls 23V-213 and 23V-312. The affected vehicles by these recalls included model years (MY) 2021 through 2023 Volkswagen ID.4 vehicles. ODI received reports of the vehicle’s doors opening while the vehicle was in motion post recall remedy.  ODI, also, received similar allegations on vehicles that were outside the scope of the recalls.Volkswagen issued recall 23V-213 on March 29, 2023, and recall 23V-213 on May 03, 2023. These recalls addressed the defect of water ingress into the circuit board assembly of the door handle. Water ingress can cause communication issues between the door handle and the door control until. This malfunction resulted in the vehicle door inadvertently opening while the vehicle was in motion.Over the course of the investigation, ODI received 17 unique VIN VOQ complaints of the vehicle doors opening while the vehicle was in motion occurring either post recall remedy or on a vehicle that was outside the recall scope. Volkswagen submitted 190 unique VIN complaints reporting the same circumstances.   On September 4, 2024, Volkswagen submitted recall 24V-651 to address the issue of inadvertent opening of the door while the vehicle is in motion. The scope of this recall expands the affected vehicles to include all MY2021-2024 Volkswagen ID.4 models, including those remedied under the subject recalls. The recall remedy consists of replacement of the door handle assembly on all four doors as well as a software update.  The software update is performed to update the door handle parameters. The new door handle will have the membrane relocated to the back of the handle to avoid standing water within the handle.  Also, a protective coating will be on the front and back of the circuit board to avoid direct moisture formation.  In view of the action being taken by Volkswagen, Recall 24V-651, ODI is closing this Recall Query.  The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.To review the ODI reports cited in the Closing Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan

"Unexpected ADS behavior

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received reports of 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles equipped with Waymo’s 5th generation automated driving system (ADS) wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle was the sole vehicle operated during a collision or wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle exhibited driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws. Reports include collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains, collisions with parked vehicles, and instances in which the ADS appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices. In certain incidents, a collision occurred shortly after the ADS exhibited unexpected behavior near traffic safety control devices. Waymo submitted incident reports involving collisions to NHTSA under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO). Other incidents, such as vehicles driving in opposing lanes with nearby oncoming traffic or entering construction zones, were identified based on publicly available reports.Based on initial evaluation of these incidents, NHTSA understands that the Waymo ADS was either engaged throughout the incident or, in certain cases when supervised by an in-vehicle test driver, the ADS disengaged in the moments just before an incident occurred.ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation to investigate the Waymo 5th Generation ADS’s performance in the incidents identified in this resume and similar scenarios, as well as to more closely assess any commonalities in these incidents. The investigation will evaluate the ADS’s performance in detecting and responding to traffic control devices and in avoiding collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects and vehicles.    The SGO reports cited in the Opening Resume can be found by report identifiers listed below on NHTSA's SGO website: https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting#dataSGO 2021-01 report IDs:30270-116030270-122030270-149430270-436330270-508130270-531830270-575830270-613330270-654830270-656130270-683830270-698130270-704830270-705430270-705830270-730830270-731230270-7534nan

"Rear-end Collisions Involving Zoox Vehicles

On May 10, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24015) to assess reports of sudden unexpected braking in Zoox vehicles, leading to rear-end collisions, as well as to evaluate the performance of the Zoox Automated Driving System in crosswalks around vulnerable road users and in other similar rear-end collision scenarios. These unexpected braking events can increase the risk of a collision. To assess these risks, ODI collected information from Zoox as part of this investigation. In response to ODI’s Request for Information, Zoox provided information describing hard braking events commanded by the ADS. These hard braking events were identified by certain thresholds, including rate of deceleration. ODI analyzed the hard braking events commanded by the Zoox ADS and determined that Zoox ADS-equipped vehicles contributed to 4 collisions. Each of these collisions involved a vulnerable road user, with three of the incidents resulting in injury. Three of the collisions were reported under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), while the other collision was not reportable under the SGO.On March 13, 2025, Zoox ﬁled a safety recall (NHTSA Recall No. 25E019) stating that in specific circumstances “the Zoox ADS software may have reacted over-cautiously and braked unnecessarily hard” and that “the Zoox ADS software may have incorrectly anticipated a collision and braked unnecessarily hard.” These behaviors could lead to increased risk of a rear-end collision caused by unnecessary hard braking.

"Sogefi Secondary Diesel Fuel Filter Leak

The Office of Defect Investigations (ODI) has received 27 complaints alleging diesel fuel leaks due to a fracture in the secondary fuel filter housing in model year (MY) 2015-2021 Ford Motor Company (Ford) F-250, 350, 450, and 550 Super Duty vehicles equipped with 6.7L diesel engines. Of these complaints, 12 describe an engine compartment fire. The proximity of the secondary fuel filter to high heat sources creates a potential for autoignition thermal events and fires. ODI has contacted the vehicle manufacturer, Ford, and the filter manufacturer, Allevard Sogefi USA (Sogefi), and learned that the low-pressure fuel system is capable of a maximum operating pressure of 8.5 Bar, while the secondary fuel filter is only tested to seven (7) Bar during the manufacturing process. Additionally, changes starting in 2022 by both Ford and Sogefi align with a lack of similar complaints on MY 2022 and newer vehicles.  ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related problems.

"Inadvertent Automatic Emergency Braking

On May 8, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24013 to investigate reports of inadvertent activation of the automatic emergency braking (AEB) system in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. (Fisker). The complaints allege the activation of AEB without an apparent roadway obstruction in the vehicle’s forward path, resulting in sudden vehicle deceleration. This sudden deceleration occurs without adequate warning or input from the driver. The braking applications range from momentary, partial application resulting in rapid loss of speed to full application, which brings the vehicle to a complete stop in the travel lane.ODI sent Fisker an Information Request (IR) letter on May 20, 2024. On June 17 and 19, 2024, Fisker and its affiliates filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Fisker provided an incomplete response to the IR on July 1, 2024. Limited information pertaining to system validation and failure data was provided. Fisker subsequently requested more time to provide additional responsive files due to limited available resources. Fisker sent additional responsive files on September 9, 2024, September 17, 2024, and December 16, 2024, but Fisker’s response did not contain sufficient information for ODI to fully evaluate the alleged safety defect.Further, on December 27, 2024, the Fisker employees with whom ODI had been corresponding informed ODI that all Fisker employees were being “dismissed” as of that date. ODI therefore does not anticipate receiving any further responsive submissions such that it can fully evaluate the reports that led to this investigation. ODI performed phone interviews and sent a survey to consumers to obtain more information and validate the allegations. Additionally, ODI reviewed allegations of the alleged safety defect that were submitted to various online forums. Most of these reports were similar in nature to the reports received by ODI. Some of the reports in online forums appear to be duplicative reports that were also submitted to ODI. Based on the responses received and analysis of similar online reporting, there was no clear trend in the following factors pertaining to the allegations: reoccurrence of events (i.e., single or multiple incidents), speed immediately prior to the event, whether the event concluded in a reduction of speed or a full stop, roadway conditions, and warning immediately prior to the event.To date, between the reports provided by Fisker and complaints made directly to the agency, ODI is aware of over 20 reports alleging inadvertent AEB activation. Before the employees were dismissed, Fisker’s testing done in response to the inadvertent AEB allegations reportedly did not result in any inadvertent AEB activations. The “Manufacturer” and “Total” counts in the above table have been left blank because of a pending request for confidential treatment by Fisker that could not be timely addressed given the company’s status. This information factored into ODI’s investigation and analysis.The available information does not warrant further action at this time.  The closing of this investigation does not constitute a finding by NHTSA that a safety-related defect does not exist. Additionally, the Agency notes that the Vehicle Safety Act states: “A manufacturer’s filing of a petition in bankruptcy under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title 11 does not negate the manufacturer’s duty to comply with section 30112 or sections 30115 through 30120 of this title,” which include the recall provisions of the Act. The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Recall 23V838 Remedy Effectiveness

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is opening a Recall Query to assess the remedy adequacy of Recall 23V838. On December 12, 2023, Tesla filed a Defect Information Report (Recall 23V838) applicable to all Tesla models produced and equipped with any version of its Autopilot system, which Tesla described as an SAE Level 2 (L2) Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Autopilot is the simultaneous engagement of Tesla’s Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) and Autosteer. In describing the safety defect, Tesla’s Defect Information Report (DIR) explained that “the prominence and scope of the system’s controls may be insufficient to prevent driver misuse,” and Tesla committed to the deployment of a multipart remedy aimed at improving system and engagement controls and reducing mode confusion.EA22002 (upgraded from PE21020) was opened to investigate whether Tesla’s Autopilot contained a defect that created an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety and involved extensive crash analysis, human factors analysis, vehicle evaluations, and assessment of vehicle control authority and driver engagement technologies. The work conducted in these investigations aligns with Tesla’s conclusion in its 23V838 recall filing. During EA22002, ODI identified at least 13 crashes involving one or more fatalities and many more involving serious injuries in which foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.  Tesla filed Recall 23V838 to address concerns regarding the Autopilot system investigated in EA22002. Following deployment of the remedy in Recall 23V838, ODI identified concerns due to post-remedy crash events and results from preliminary NHTSA tests of remedied vehicles. Also, Tesla has stated that a portion of the remedy both requires the owner to opt in and allows a driver to readily reverse it. Tesla has also deployed non-remedy updates to address issues that appear related to ODI’s concerns under EA22002. This investigation will consider why these updates were not a part of the recall or otherwise determined to remedy a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk. ODI is therefore opening this Recall Query investigation to further evaluate the adequacy of the remedy for recall 23V838.nan

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Preliminary Evaluation is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25001) to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"Electronic Brake Module Component Failure

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received multiple Early Warning Reporting field reports alleging a loss of brake boost assist in MY2023 Cadillac LYRIQ vehicles. The reports allege a hard brake pedal, followed by a “Brake System Failure” message at start up or while driving. The EWR field reports have been verified by General Motors (GM). GM stated the electronic brake control module, also known as “eBoost”, has an internal spindle that can fracture during an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) event. GM further stated that due to the fracture, the vehicles can lose brake assist, experience speed limitation, and ABS would lose some functionality.GM indicated a new material clean break point was introduced in the assembly plants in May 2023.  GM has also developed an over the air (OTA) update, which will cycle the brake booster similarly to an ABS event at start-up for every key cycle. If the spindle fractures during this start-up cycling, a warning lamp will illuminate to prompt the customer to bring the vehicle to the dealership to be diagnosed and repaired under warranty. This software update was not conducted as a recall.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to determine the scope and severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related issues.nan

"Under hood fires caused by fuel leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) reviewed Ford Motor Company’s (Ford’s) proposed remedy for recall 24V-187. ODI evaluated information from Ford concerning the recall remedy for the involved vehicles.Ford issued recall 24V-187 on March 8, 2024, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2022-2023 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022 Ford Escape vehicles equipped with 1.5L engines. Recall 24V-187 states that a fuel injector may crack resulting in liquid fuel and/or fuel vapor migration to, and accumulation near, ignition sources that may cause an under hood fire, fuel odor both outside and inside of the vehicle, and increase the risk of injury. Recall 24V-187 further states that a cracked fuel injector in the engine allows for fuel to leak at a high rate into the cylinder head, which can travel out via a drain hole and down onto hot surfaces on the exhaust and/or turbo system.The recall remedy for 24V-187 involves 1) an engine control software update and 2) installation of a drain tube. The engine control software update will detect a pressure drop in the fuel rail providing a “seek service” message within the vehicle’s instrument cluster, as well as invoke a strategy to disable the high-pressure fuel pump, de-rate engine power output, and reduce temperatures of possible ignition sources in the engine compartment. The drain tube will allow fuel to drain from the cylinder head hole to the ground below the vehicle away from surfaces which may initiate combustion. The recall remedy does not include replacement of the cracked fuel injector.On November 18, 2022, recall 22V-859 was issued involving MY 2020-2023 Ford Escape and MY 2021-2023 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles. Stated with recall 22V-859, the Description of the Defect, Description of the Safety Risk, Description of the Cause, Identification of Any Warning that can Occur, and Description of Remedy Program are the same as stated in recall 24V-187.ODI is opening this Recall Query (RQ) to evaluate the adequacy and safety consequences of the remedy described in recall 24V-187.nan

"Front Seat Belt Assemblies may be Missing the Rivet that Secures the Quick Connector and Wire Plate

On April 4, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened RQ24006 to investigate American Honda Motor Co.’s (Honda’s) proposed remedy for recall 23V-782 as well as scope of the vehicles involved.Honda issued recall 23V-782 on November 21, 2023, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2023-2024 Honda Accord, Honda Accord Hybrid, and Honda HR-V vehicles. Recall 23V-782 states that the driver and front passenger seat belt pretensioner assemblies may have been manufactured without a rivet that secures the pretensioner quick connector and wire plate. Recall documentation states that seat belt pretensioner assemblies that are missing the rivet will not properly restrain the occupant in the event of a collision, increasing the risk of injury.  Subject defective seat belt assemblies are installed as original equipment for both the driver and front passenger positions for the HR-V, but only for the driver position for the Accord and Accord Hybrid.The recall remedy for 23V-782 instructs the technician to inspect both front seat belt pretensioner assemblies and, if necessary, replace them. The inspection procedure requires the technician to utilize a pull force gauge to determine whether the subject component is missing the subject rivet and requires replacement. Parts requiring replacement are determined by whether the pretensioner quick connector separates from the pretensioner assembly while the technician is pulling on the seat belt. If no separation occurs, then the part is determined to be not defective and not require replacement.There have been no reports alleging a failure of seat belt pretensioner assemblies after the inspect and replace remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed. Additionally, no comparable failures have been observed in field data for similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall. As of the 4th quarter of 2024, the recall completion rate is at approximately 84% of the total recalled population.In view of the lack of failures after the remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed, and the lack of failures in similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ).

"Failure to open door

On April 1, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24010 to investigate instances of failure to open the door in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. Some complaints allege the inability to open the door from either the interior or exterior door handle, resulting in the need to use another door to egress.The investigation revealed that all four exterior door handles are subject to sticking in the extended/unlocked position, which may result in the inability to unlatch the door from either the interior or exterior door handle. The root cause is a dimensional interference between the exterior door handle chassis pocket and door handle, causing friction during handle deployment and retraction. The inability to open and egress from the occupant’s adjacent door presents an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety.On June 27, 2024, Fisker filed recall 24V-466 for certain MY 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles. The recall remedy includes an inspection procedure for all four doors and provides replacement of the outer door handle if a “Not Okay” result is found.In view of the recall action being taken by Fisker, ODI is closing this Preliminary Evaluation. The agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"2022 RAM Transmission Snap Ring Failure

The Office of Defect Investigations (ODI) has received 82 complaints alleging loss of motive power due to an internal transmission failure of the K1 snap ring in model year 2022 Ram 3500, 4500, and 5500 vehicles. Of these complaints, 16 describe a complete loss of motive power at speeds greater than 25 miles per hour, without the ability for the vehicle to resume normal operation. The subject vehicles can be up-fit as an ambulance and other emergency response vehicle or may be heavily loaded when used for towing. During the failure event, the snap ring becomes dislodged and forward gears 1-4 are no longer functional, potentially leaving the vehicle disabled in or near the roadway and/or negatively affect the emergency mission. ODI contacted the manufacturer, FCA US, LLC d/b/a Stellantis North America (FCA), and learned that technical service bulletin (TSB) TSB-21-002-23 is related to the alleged defect condition. Additionally, FCA has conducted dynamometer and field testing and has explained to ODI that during the event a warning message will display to the operator, and gear 5 and reverse will remain available.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related problems.

"Unintended Transmission Downshift

In September 2016, Ford Motor Company (Ford) issued safety recall 16V-248 which included certain model year (MY) 2011-2012 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions. This recall was in response to allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, increasing the risk of a crash and/or injury, and included approximately 153,581 vehicles. Ford identified the root cause of the unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear to be intermittent signal loss from the transmission’s Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor due to solder joint cracks on the OSS circuit board as a result of manufacturing process issues. The OSS sensor is mounted onto the molded lead frame and transmits changes in transmission shaft speed to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). The remedy program described in safety recall 16V-248 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring.In December 2017, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ17-010) to assess the scope and remedy effectiveness of safety recall 16V-248. As a result of this ODI investigation, Ford issued safety recall 19V-075 to expand the scope of 16V-248 to include MY 2011-2013 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions and included approximately 1,263,051 vehicles. The remedy program described in safety recall 19V-075 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring. In June 2019, Ford issued safety recall 19V-433 as the remedy program used to service MY 2013 Ford F-150 5.0L and 6.2L vehicles in accordance with safety recall 19V-075 did not contain the necessary updates to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 107,857 vehicles.On March 27, 2024, ODI opened this Recall Query (RQ24-005) to investigate the scope of the above-described safety recalls. At the time that this investigation was opened, ODI had received 86 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) reporting allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, in MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles. As a result of this Recall Query, Ford filled safety recall 24V-444 on June 14, 2024, to include MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles and expand the scope of safety recalls 16V-248, 19V-075 and 19V-433. The remedy program described in safety recall 24V-444 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 552,188 vehicles.In its May 2024 response to ODI’s information request, Ford concluded that a predominant root cause for the intermittent OSS signal loss has not been identified outside of the original safety recall (16V-248). Ford’s investigation also concluded that the primary causes of the defect in MY 2014 F-150 vehicles were related to the molded lead frame and the control assembly transmission main. In the May 2024 response, Ford identified 2,184 total reports that described unintended vehicle transmission downshifting and rear wheel lock-up events; 1,441 warranty claims and 743 reports from consumer complaints, field reports, consumer surveys, and lawsuits/legal claims. Note that the values presented here and in the table above represent the total number of reports which can include a single consumer with multiple reports of the same event as well as a consumer with reports of multiple distinct events. Of the 1,441 warranty claims, 551 warranty claims involved repair of the molded lead frame (38%) and 509 warranty claims involved repair of the control assembly transmission main (35%).Ford has also stated that the PCM programming used to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting was implemented starting with MY 2015 vehicle #1 production and onward.In view of the safety recall action being taken by Ford, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ24-005). The agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the rear view camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Engineering Analysis (EA) is being opened to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"Crash incidents during Actually Smart Summon sessions

Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon are features on certain Tesla vehicles that allow a user to remotely move the vehicle to the user or to another designated location, through use of a phone app. The Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 1 complaint (VOQ) alleging that an Actually Smart Summon session resulted in a crash and has reviewed at least 3 media reports of apparently similar crashes. All four incidents involve the subject Tesla vehicles operating in Actually Smart Summon failing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash. Actually Smart Summon replaced Smart Summon and provided users with extended vehicle operating range while expanding vehicle connectivity through phone app live camera feeds and increased user latency experience. ODI has received 12 Smart Summon related VOQs alleging crash typology similar to the crashes experienced by users of Actually Smart Summon during sessions with little time for operators to react. ODI is aware of multiple crash allegations, involving both Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon, where the user had too little reaction time to avoid a crash, either with the available line of sight or releasing the phone app button, which stops the vehicle’s movement. Tesla has not reported any Smart Summon or Actually Smart Summon crashes through the Standing General Order for crashes involving ADS or Level 2 ADAS, which requires reporting of crashes on publicly accessible roads. ODI is opening this preliminary evaluation to investigate Actually Smart Summon’s capabilities as they relate to the subject and similar crashes, including the system's operation and ﬁeld performance in FSD equipped vehicles and vehicles included in free trial offers. NHTSA will evaluate the top speed that a vehicle can attain while Actually Smart Summon is engaged, designed-in operating restrictions for usage on public roads, and line of sight requirements. NHTSA expects this preliminary evaluation to include review of remote vehicle control through the phone app at various distances and lines of sight, including app connectivity delays resulting in increased stopping distance and the ability to utilize Actually Smart Summon in roadway environments or operating conditions for which the current version of the system is neither intended nor designed.  To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identiﬁcation Number document, go to NHTSA.gov. nan

"Loss of Motive Power

In January 2024, The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24002) to investigate allegations of loss of motive power in model year (MY) 2021 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles. In April 2024, Ford issued safety recall 24V-267 covering 456,565 MY 2021-2024 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022-2023 Ford Maverick vehicles. The recall addressed occurrences of loss of motive power resulting from sudden degradation of the 12V battery during the drive cycle. When the battery failure occurs, consumers may experience a complete loss of engine power without the ability to restart, accompanied by the loss of 12V accessories, including hazard lights. The recall remedy consists of software updates to the body control module and powertrain control module, which were designed to provide improved detection of the 12V battery state of charge during the drive cycle and provide warning to consumers if the battery is degraded.ODI has since received 15 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) describing loss of motive power incidents for MY 2021 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles that received the 24V-267 recall remedy. Consumers describe that prior to the loss of motive power, there were no warnings related to the 12V battery or vehicle electrical system. Additionally, multiple consumers reported that after the vehicle was towed to the dealership following the loss of motive power, the event was diagnosed to the 12V battery, and a battery replacement was the only required repair.ODI is opening this Recall Query on MY 2021-2024 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022-2023 Ford Maverick vehicles to assess the effectiveness of the 24V-267 recall remedy.

"Frame Flex on Grand Design Fifth Wheel Recreational Trailers

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received twenty-three complaints alleging excessive frame flex on model year 2017-2023 Grand Design fifth wheel recreational trailers, models Momentum and Solitude. Twenty-two of the complaints allege that excessive frame flex resulted in a cargo or entry door opening while in transit, some with objects lost on roadways, while six complaints also state that slideouts extended out partially.  ODI has been in contact with both Grand Design and Lippert, the frame manufacturer. Grand Design believes that some frame flex, generally considered to be vertical movement in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel, is normal. However, Grand Design has developed a technical service bulletin (TSB), to evaluate concerns of excessive frame flex, defined as vertical movement greater than 3/8 inch. Per Grand Design, the frame flex is only occurring in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel and is resulting in cosmetic defects such as moving sidewalls, damage to cabinets, binding doors, etc. However, Lippert believes that the effects of frame flex may also extend back to the front axle of the trailer.  While Lippert provides frames for multiple trailer manufacturers, the majority of complaints are for these Grand Design products.Cargo and entry doors that open and slideouts that extend while in transit increase the risk of injury or a crash. ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to determine whether an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety exists.To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan

"Underhood fires

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 9 Vehicle Owner's Questionnaire (VOQ) reports, 1 Death and Injury report, and multiple field reports alleging incidents of engine compartment fires in model year (MY) 2021-2023 Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator vehicles. The majority of the reports describe a fire occurring while the ignition in the vehicle was in an ‘OFF’ state with a suspected origin at the passenger front side of the engine compartment. An ignition ‘OFF’ vehicle fire can result in an increased risk of occupant injury, injury to persons outside the vehicle, and property damage, with little to no warning.ODI has contacted the vehicle manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), and learned of several thermal events originating at the power steering pump electrical connector in recent model year Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator vehicles. The location of the pump connector is located at the passenger front side of the engine compartment, coinciding with the majority of fire reports known to ODI.

"Semi-Trailer Side Underride Guards

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a petition from Eric Hein, Director of the Institute for Safer Trucking dated July 3, 2024, requesting an investigation of all van-type (also known as box) semi-trailers due to collisions with passenger vehicles and other vulnerable road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists) resulting in significant injuries or death due to the lack of side underride guards (SUGs). On August 26, 2024, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP24004 to evaluate the petitioner’s request. No trailer manufacturer or equipment supplier was identified as the specific subject of the petition. The petition itself can be reviewed at NHTSA.gov under ODI Number 11599188.Currently, a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) requiring side underride guards on semi-trailers does not exist. The petitioner contends that a failure to include side underride guards equates to a safety defect in the semi-trailer’s design, construction and performance. ODI was petitioned in 2021 for this same issue and, after evaluation, denied the request (DP21004). The petitioner here states that evidence of SUG effectiveness to prevent fatalities and mitigate serious injuries “has continued to accumulate” since the denial of DP21004. The petitioner also alleges that “[d]espite a high severity of risk resulting in frequent severe or fatal injuries from side underride crashes, NHTSA has taken no action to investigate recalling semi-trailers without SUGs.”Pursuant to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), NHTSA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that summarized and requested comment on a 2022 NHTSA report with an analysis of potential effects of a requirement for side underride guards on new trailers and semitrailers. 88 Fed. Reg. 24536 (Apr. 21, 2023). NHTSA’s Office of Rulemaking is currently reviewing over 2,000 comments received. Also pursuant to the IIJA, on June 18, 2024, the NHTSA-facilitated Advisory Committee on Underride Protection (ACUP) issued its biennial report to Congress and the Secretary of Transportation. This biennial report consists of a majority report and a minority report summarizing its work to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on safety regulations related to underride crashes that have caused severe injury and death. Though the committee’s charter was extended through June 2025, the committee concluded its work following the publication of the biennial report in June 2024.In addition, NHTSA previously announced several actions related to truck trailer underride safety, including improving data collection of underride crashes by recommending inclusion of underride data in state crash data systems and by providing educational materials to state and local police departments on identifying and recording underride crashes. ODI also actively participates in the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) events where it has encouraged law enforcement to report underride crashes, and proposed CVSA focus on underride guards during the 2024 Operation Road Check, a nationwide 72-hour safety blitz. NHTSA is, further, conducting research on rear impact guard designs that better protect occupants of passenger vehicles in even more rear underride crash scenarios. And NHTSA, with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, published a pamphlet in August 2022—which was distributed to law enforcement through various channels—that explains how to identify and record such crashes (this pamphlet is available at https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/les/2022-08/Underride-Crash- Pamphlet_071522_v6atag.pdf).ODI searched its databases and found no injury or fatality trend specific to any make, model, or model year trailer within Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) and Early Warning Reporting (EWR) data and found one EWR report of vulnerable road user injury or fatalities. ODI also met, separately, with Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. (UTM) and Auto Haulers Association of America regarding UTM’s SUG and to better understand the operational environment of low clearance vehicles, respectively. Based on the information available to the agency, trailer manufacturers continue to pursue side underride guard technology, and at least one manufacturer is currently offering an optional guard.The petitioner submitted two documents to ODI on September 11, 2024. The first was a letter from UTM to Marianne Karth (Petitioner of DP21004 & DP22004) which recounted UTM’s testing of SUGs. The second document was an information sheet generated by the petitioner contesting UTM’s claims. The petitioner also submitted certain documents to ODI on October 1, 2024, which the petitioner had previously submitted separately as part of comments on a collection of information pertaining to Reporting and Documents About Potential Defects (Docket No. NHTSA-2024-0055). This included 45 files regarding 49 unique crashes. ODI reviewed that information and found that of the 49 crashes, twenty-nine (29) potentially involved a subject vehicle. The majority of the 45 files were from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a NHTSA-maintained database of state crash data comprised of certain, albeit often relatively limited information. Notably, of the 29 files, only 2 included the make, model, and model year of the subject vehicle.After consideration of the petition, including the reports and documents provided by the petitioner, NHTSA believes the issues raised here are best addressed through its recent rulemaking and the ongoing actions under IIJA. Accordingly, NHTSA has decided not to open a defect investigation, and the petition is denied. The denial of this petition does not foreclose the agency from taking further action if warranted or making a future finding that a safety-related defect exists based upon additional information the agency may receive.nan

"Trailer Hitch Receiver Structure may Crack and Separate

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 5 complaints for various 2016-2022 Thor Motor Coach motorhomes alleging that the trailer hitch receiver (""hitch"") or recreational vehicle (RV) frame cracked and/or separated, including one which resulted in the towed item detaching and causing property damage. Other examples of hitch or frame cracking have been discovered prior to hitch separation.ODI has contacted the RV manufacturer, Thor, the frame extension manufacturer, Mor-Ryde, and the hitch manufacturer, Lippert, who, in response, allege that consumers are overloading the hitch. While the amount that a motorhome can tow must be calculated after determining the cargo, passenger and liquids weights, the hitch that failed had an 8,000lb limit and the vehicle it was flat-towing weighed approximately 4,000lbs.Hitch or frame cracking resulting in the towed item detaching and becoming loose on the roadway increases the risk of a crash to others on the roadway.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to determine whether an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety exists.

"Engine Stall With Intermittent Restart

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 80 consumer complaints alleging an engine stall and loss of motive power on model year (MY) 2022 RAM 1500 pickup trucks and 2022 Jeep Wagoneer SUV vehicles. The particular engines in the subject vehicles are equipped with the Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group LLC (FCA) 5.7L Hemi eTorque system. The eTorque system is a mild hybrid system that lets the vehicle partially power itself. It accomplishes this by converting the captured energy from the braking system into electricity for the battery pack, which is then used to power a variety of electrical components. ETorque engines replace the alternator with a 48-volt battery-powered belt drive and a motor generator. The motor generator provides extra torque to the crankshaft during gear changes. Simultaneously, the motor generator uses the 48-volt battery pack to increase torque. Many of the complaints state that the vehicle's engine would shut off, often while travelling at slow speed, the vehicle would shift into park and apply the emergency brake. The vehicles were sometimes able to be restarted. In addition, complaints state that the malfunction warning light with the battery fault symbol appeared on the dash.  Many complaints state that a low voltage condition fault is present, sometimes not being able to restart the vehicle. On April 13, 2023, FCA announced recall 23V-265 describing a defect in certain 2021 Ram 1500 vehicles equipped with 5.7L eTorque engines.  The recall described a defect in the powertrain control module software can cause an incorrect fuel mixture condition in the engine, and result in an engine stall. In February of 2024, ODI provided the complaints on the 2022 Ram 1500 and Wagoneer vehicles to FCA. After reviewing the complaints, FCA stated that “the loss of motive power was likely not caused by an over rich fuel condition (as outlined in recall 23V-265), but rather some other cause (e.g., an electrical concern that causes the engine to shut down).”   A Preliminary Evaluation has been opened to assess the scope, frequency, root cause(s) and consequences of these loss/stall of motive power incidents.  Additionally, ODI may expand the scope of the subject population during the investigation, if needed.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.RQ24011 is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25003) to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the Rear View Camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

On May 16, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened Recall Query (RQ) RQ24010 to investigate the remedy and scope of recalls 23V-213 and 23V-312. The affected vehicles by these recalls included model years (MY) 2021 through 2023 Volkswagen ID.4 vehicles. ODI received reports of the vehicle’s doors opening while the vehicle was in motion post recall remedy.  ODI, also, received similar allegations on vehicles that were outside the scope of the recalls.Volkswagen issued recall 23V-213 on March 29, 2023, and recall 23V-213 on May 03, 2023. These recalls addressed the defect of water ingress into the circuit board assembly of the door handle. Water ingress can cause communication issues between the door handle and the door control until. This malfunction resulted in the vehicle door inadvertently opening while the vehicle was in motion.Over the course of the investigation, ODI received 17 unique VIN VOQ complaints of the vehicle doors opening while the vehicle was in motion occurring either post recall remedy or on a vehicle that was outside the recall scope. Volkswagen submitted 190 unique VIN complaints reporting the same circumstances.   On September 4, 2024, Volkswagen submitted recall 24V-651 to address the issue of inadvertent opening of the door while the vehicle is in motion. The scope of this recall expands the affected vehicles to include all MY2021-2024 Volkswagen ID.4 models, including those remedied under the subject recalls.

"Unexpected ADS behavior

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received reports of 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles equipped with Waymo’s 5th generation automated driving system (ADS) wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle was the sole vehicle operated during a collision or wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle exhibited driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws. Reports include collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains, collisions with parked vehicles, and instances in which the ADS appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices. In certain incidents, a collision occurred shortly after the ADS exhibited unexpected behavior near traffic safety control devices. Waymo submitted incident reports involving collisions to NHTSA under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO). Other incidents, such as vehicles driving in opposing lanes with nearby oncoming traffic or entering construction zones, were identified based on publicly available reports.Based on initial evaluation of these incidents, NHTSA understands that the Waymo ADS was either engaged throughout the incident or, in certain cases when supervised by an in-vehicle test driver, the ADS disengaged in the moments just before an incident occurred.ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation to investigate the Waymo 5th Generation ADS’s performance in the incidents identified in this resume and similar scenarios, as well as to more closely assess any commonalities in these incidents. The investigation will evaluate the ADS’s performance in detecting and responding to traffic control devices and in avoiding collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects and vehicles.    The SGO reports cited in the Opening Resume can be found by report identifiers listed below on NHTSA's SGO website: https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting#dataSGO 2021-01 report IDs:30270-116030270-122030270-149430270-436330270-508130270-531830270-575830270-613330270-654830270-656130270-683830270-698130270-704830270-705430270-705830270-730830270-731230270-7534nan

"Rear-end Collisions Involving Zoox Vehicles

On May 10, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24015) to assess reports of sudden unexpected braking in Zoox vehicles, leading to rear-end collisions, as well as to evaluate the performance of the Zoox Automated Driving System in crosswalks around vulnerable road users and in other similar rear-end collision scenarios. These unexpected braking events can increase the risk of a collision. To assess these risks, ODI collected information from Zoox as part of this investigation. In response to ODI’s Request for Information, Zoox provided information describing hard braking events commanded by the ADS. These hard braking events were identified by certain thresholds, including rate of deceleration. ODI analyzed the hard braking events commanded by the Zoox ADS and determined that Zoox ADS-equipped vehicles contributed to 4 collisions. Each of these collisions involved a vulnerable road user, with three of the incidents resulting in injury. Three of the collisions were reported under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), while the other collision was not reportable under the SGO.On March 13, 2025, Zoox ﬁled a safety recall (NHTSA Recall No. 25E019) stating that in specific circumstances “the Zoox ADS software may have reacted over-cautiously and braked unnecessarily hard” and that “the Zoox ADS software may have incorrectly anticipated a collision and braked unnecessarily hard.” These behaviors could lead to increased risk of a rear-end collision caused by unnecessary hard braking. The Zoox recall report indicated that Zoox's ADS has been remedied through a software update that addresses the described defects. As of November 7, 2024, the updated software was released to all impacted Zoox vehicles.In view of the recall action taken by Zoox and ODI’s analysis of the available data, including data presented by Zoox demonstrating a resolution of these hard braking incidents after the software update, ODI is closing this Preliminary Evaluation. NHTSA reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by new circumstances.To review the SGO reports cited above, go to NHTSA.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting.  The SGO report ID numbers are provided below:30610-7578     30610-7589     30610-4810    nan

"Sogefi Secondary Diesel Fuel Filter Leak

The Office of Defect Investigations (ODI) has received 27 complaints alleging diesel fuel leaks due to a fracture in the secondary fuel filter housing in model year (MY) 2015-2021 Ford Motor Company (Ford) F-250, 350, 450, and 550 Super Duty vehicles equipped with 6.7L diesel engines. Of these complaints, 12 describe an engine compartment fire. The proximity of the secondary fuel filter to high heat sources creates a potential for autoignition thermal events and fires. ODI has contacted the vehicle manufacturer, Ford, and the filter manufacturer, Allevard Sogefi USA (Sogefi), and learned that the low-pressure fuel system is capable of a maximum operating pressure of 8.5 Bar, while the secondary fuel filter is only tested to seven (7) Bar during the manufacturing process. Additionally, changes starting in 2022 by both Ford and Sogefi align with a lack of similar complaints on MY 2022 and newer vehicles.  ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related problems.

"Inadvertent Automatic Emergency Braking

On May 8, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24013 to investigate reports of inadvertent activation of the automatic emergency braking (AEB) system in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. (Fisker). The complaints allege the activation of AEB without an apparent roadway obstruction in the vehicle’s forward path, resulting in sudden vehicle deceleration. This sudden deceleration occurs without adequate warning or input from the driver. The braking applications range from momentary, partial application resulting in rapid loss of speed to full application, which brings the vehicle to a complete stop in the travel lane.ODI sent Fisker an Information Request (IR) letter on May 20, 2024. On June 17 and 19, 2024, Fisker and its affiliates filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Fisker provided an incomplete response to the IR on July 1, 2024. Limited information pertaining to system validation and failure data was provided. Fisker subsequently requested more time to provide additional responsive files due to limited available resources. Fisker sent additional responsive files on September 9, 2024, September 17, 2024, and December 16, 2024, but Fisker’s response did not contain sufficient information for ODI to fully evaluate the alleged safety defect.Further, on December 27, 2024, the Fisker employees with whom ODI had been corresponding informed ODI that all Fisker employees were being “dismissed” as of that date. ODI therefore does not anticipate receiving any further responsive submissions such that it can fully evaluate the reports that led to this investigation. ODI performed phone interviews and sent a survey to consumers to obtain more information and validate the allegations. Additionally, ODI reviewed allegations of the alleged safety defect that were submitted to various online forums. Most of these reports were similar in nature to the reports received by ODI. Some of the reports in online forums appear to be duplicative reports that were also submitted to ODI. Based on the responses received and analysis of similar online reporting, there was no clear trend in the following factors pertaining to the allegations: reoccurrence of events (i.e., single or multiple incidents), speed immediately prior to the event, whether the event concluded in a reduction of speed or a full stop, roadway conditions, and warning immediately prior to the event.To date, between the reports provided by Fisker and complaints made directly to the agency, ODI is aware of over 20 reports alleging inadvertent AEB activation. Before the employees were dismissed, Fisker’s testing done in response to the inadvertent AEB allegations reportedly did not result in any inadvertent AEB activations. The “Manufacturer” and “Total” counts in the above table have been left blank because of a pending request for confidential treatment by Fisker that could not be timely addressed given the company’s status. This information factored into ODI’s investigation and analysis.The available information does not warrant further action at this time.  The closing of this investigation does not constitute a finding by NHTSA that a safety-related defect does not exist. Additionally, the Agency notes that the Vehicle Safety Act states: “A manufacturer’s filing of a petition in bankruptcy under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title 11 does not negate the manufacturer’s duty to comply with section 30112 or sections 30115 through 30120 of this title,” which include the recall provisions of the Act. The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Recall 23V838 Remedy Effectiveness

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is opening a Recall Query to assess the remedy adequacy of Recall 23V838. On December 12, 2023, Tesla filed a Defect Information Report (Recall 23V838) applicable to all Tesla models produced and equipped with any version of its Autopilot system, which Tesla described as an SAE Level 2 (L2) Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Autopilot is the simultaneous engagement of Tesla’s Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) and Autosteer. In describing the safety defect, Tesla’s Defect Information Report (DIR) explained that “the prominence and scope of the system’s controls may be insufficient to prevent driver misuse,” and Tesla committed to the deployment of a multipart remedy aimed at improving system and engagement controls and reducing mode confusion.EA22002 (upgraded from PE21020) was opened to investigate whether Tesla’s Autopilot contained a defect that created an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety and involved extensive crash analysis, human factors analysis, vehicle evaluations, and assessment of vehicle control authority and driver engagement technologies. The work conducted in these investigations aligns with Tesla’s conclusion in its 23V838 recall filing. During EA22002, ODI identified at least 13 crashes involving one or more fatalities and many more involving serious injuries in which foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.  Tesla filed Recall 23V838 to address concerns regarding the Autopilot system investigated in EA22002. Following deployment of the remedy in Recall 23V838, ODI identified concerns due to post-remedy crash events and results from preliminary NHTSA tests of remedied vehicles. Also, Tesla has stated that a portion of the remedy both requires the owner to opt in and allows a driver to readily reverse it. Tesla has also deployed non-remedy updates to address issues that appear related to ODI’s concerns under EA22002. This investigation will consider why these updates were not a part of the recall or otherwise determined to remedy a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk. ODI is therefore opening this Recall Query investigation to further evaluate the adequacy of the remedy for recall 23V838.nan

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Preliminary Evaluation is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25001) to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"Electronic Brake Module Component Failure

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received multiple Early Warning Reporting field reports alleging a loss of brake boost assist in MY2023 Cadillac LYRIQ vehicles. The reports allege a hard brake pedal, followed by a “Brake System Failure” message at start up or while driving. The EWR field reports have been verified by General Motors (GM). GM stated the electronic brake control module, also known as “eBoost”, has an internal spindle that can fracture during an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) event. GM further stated that due to the fracture, the vehicles can lose brake assist, experience speed limitation, and ABS would lose some functionality.GM indicated a new material clean break point was introduced in the assembly plants in May 2023.  GM has also developed an over the air (OTA) update, which will cycle the brake booster similarly to an ABS event at start-up for every key cycle. If the spindle fractures during this start-up cycling, a warning lamp will illuminate to prompt the customer to bring the vehicle to the dealership to be diagnosed and repaired under warranty. This software update was not conducted as a recall.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to determine the scope and severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related issues.nan

"Under hood fires caused by fuel leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) reviewed Ford Motor Company’s (Ford’s) proposed remedy for recall 24V-187. ODI evaluated information from Ford concerning the recall remedy for the involved vehicles.Ford issued recall 24V-187 on March 8, 2024, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2022-2023 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022 Ford Escape vehicles equipped with 1.5L engines. Recall 24V-187 states that a fuel injector may crack resulting in liquid fuel and/or fuel vapor migration to, and accumulation near, ignition sources that may cause an under hood fire, fuel odor both outside and inside of the vehicle, and increase the risk of injury. Recall 24V-187 further states that a cracked fuel injector in the engine allows for fuel to leak at a high rate into the cylinder head, which can travel out via a drain hole and down onto hot surfaces on the exhaust and/or turbo system.The recall remedy for 24V-187 involves 1) an engine control software update and 2) installation of a drain tube. The engine control software update will detect a pressure drop in the fuel rail providing a “seek service” message within the vehicle’s instrument cluster, as well as invoke a strategy to disable the high-pressure fuel pump, de-rate engine power output, and reduce temperatures of possible ignition sources in the engine compartment. The drain tube will allow fuel to drain from the cylinder head hole to the ground below the vehicle away from surfaces which may initiate combustion. The recall remedy does not include replacement of the cracked fuel injector.On November 18, 2022, recall 22V-859 was issued involving MY 2020-2023 Ford Escape and MY 2021-2023 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles. Stated with recall 22V-859, the Description of the Defect, Description of the Safety Risk, Description of the Cause, Identification of Any Warning that can Occur, and Description of Remedy Program are the same as stated in recall 24V-187.ODI is opening this Recall Query (RQ) to evaluate the adequacy and safety consequences of the remedy described in recall 24V-187.nan

"Front Seat Belt Assemblies may be Missing the Rivet that Secures the Quick Connector and Wire Plate

On April 4, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened RQ24006 to investigate American Honda Motor Co.’s (Honda’s) proposed remedy for recall 23V-782 as well as scope of the vehicles involved.Honda issued recall 23V-782 on November 21, 2023, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2023-2024 Honda Accord, Honda Accord Hybrid, and Honda HR-V vehicles. Recall 23V-782 states that the driver and front passenger seat belt pretensioner assemblies may have been manufactured without a rivet that secures the pretensioner quick connector and wire plate. Recall documentation states that seat belt pretensioner assemblies that are missing the rivet will not properly restrain the occupant in the event of a collision, increasing the risk of injury.  Subject defective seat belt assemblies are installed as original equipment for both the driver and front passenger positions for the HR-V, but only for the driver position for the Accord and Accord Hybrid.The recall remedy for 23V-782 instructs the technician to inspect both front seat belt pretensioner assemblies and, if necessary, replace them. The inspection procedure requires the technician to utilize a pull force gauge to determine whether the subject component is missing the subject rivet and requires replacement. Parts requiring replacement are determined by whether the pretensioner quick connector separates from the pretensioner assembly while the technician is pulling on the seat belt. If no separation occurs, then the part is determined to be not defective and not require replacement.There have been no reports alleging a failure of seat belt pretensioner assemblies after the inspect and replace remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed. Additionally, no comparable failures have been observed in field data for similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall. As of the 4th quarter of 2024, the recall completion rate is at approximately 84% of the total recalled population.In view of the lack of failures after the remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed, and the lack of failures in similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ). The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.nan

"Failure to open door

On April 1, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24010 to investigate instances of failure to open the door in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. Some complaints allege the inability to open the door from either the interior or exterior door handle, resulting in the need to use another door to egress.The investigation revealed that all four exterior door handles are subject to sticking in the extended/unlocked position, which may result in the inability to unlatch the door from either the interior or exterior door handle. The root cause is a dimensional interference between the exterior door handle chassis pocket and door handle, causing friction during handle deployment and retraction. The inability to open and egress from the occupant’s adjacent door presents an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety.On June 27, 2024, Fisker filed recall 24V-466 for certain MY 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles. The recall remedy includes an inspection procedure for all four doors and provides replacement of the outer door handle if a “Not Okay” result is found.In view of the recall action being taken by Fisker, ODI is closing this Preliminary Evaluation. The agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Unintended Transmission Downshift

In September 2016, Ford Motor Company (Ford) issued safety recall 16V-248 which included certain model year (MY) 2011-2012 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions. This recall was in response to allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, increasing the risk of a crash and/or injury, and included approximately 153,581 vehicles. Ford identified the root cause of the unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear to be intermittent signal loss from the transmission’s Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor due to solder joint cracks on the OSS circuit board as a result of manufacturing process issues. The OSS sensor is mounted onto the molded lead frame and transmits changes in transmission shaft speed to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). The remedy program described in safety recall 16V-248 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring.In December 2017, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ17-010) to assess the scope and remedy effectiveness of safety recall 16V-248. As a result of this ODI investigation, Ford issued safety recall 19V-075 to expand the scope of 16V-248 to include MY 2011-2013 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions and included approximately 1,263,051 vehicles. The remedy program described in safety recall 19V-075 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring. In June 2019, Ford issued safety recall 19V-433 as the remedy program used to service MY 2013 Ford F-150 5.0L and 6.2L vehicles in accordance with safety recall 19V-075 did not contain the necessary updates to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 107,857 vehicles.On March 27, 2024, ODI opened this Recall Query (RQ24-005) to investigate the scope of the above-described safety recalls. At the time that this investigation was opened, ODI had received 86 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) reporting allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, in MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles. As a result of this Recall Query, Ford filled safety recall 24V-444 on June 14, 2024, to include MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles and expand the scope of safety recalls 16V-248, 19V-075 and 19V-433. The remedy program described in safety recall 24V-444 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 552,188 vehicles.In its May 2024 response to ODI’s information request, Ford concluded that a predominant root cause for the intermittent OSS signal loss has not been identified outside of the original safety recall (16V-248). Ford’s investigation also concluded that the primary causes of the defect in MY 2014 F-150 vehicles were related to the molded lead frame and the control assembly transmission main. In the May 2024 response, Ford identified 2,184 total reports that described unintended vehicle transmission downshifting and rear wheel lock-up events; 1,441 warranty claims and 743 reports from consumer complaints, field reports, consumer surveys, and lawsuits/legal claims. Note that the values presented here and in the table above represent the total number of reports which can include a single consumer with multiple reports of the same event as well as a consumer with reports of multiple distinct events. Of the 1,441 warranty claims, 551 warranty claims involved repair of the molded lead frame (38%) and 509 warranty claims involved repair of the control assembly transmission main (35%).Ford has also stated that the PCM programming used to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting was implemented starting with MY 2015 vehicle #1 production and onward.In view of the safety recall action being taken by Ford, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ24-005). The agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Fuel Leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a complaint alleging a compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel leak from a Luxfer Type 4 CNG 60 diesel gallon equivalent (DGE) 26x108 size fuel container.  The container was used in a system built and installed by Natural Gas Fuel Systems, LLC, dba Cummins Clean Fuel Technologies (CCFT).  A strong odor alerted the driver of the fuel leak, which occurred at a fracture at the fuel container's threaded aluminum alloy fixed end boss.The fuel container is positioned longitudinally within an enclosure structure that is attached to the truck's passenger side frame rail in a side-mount configuration. The fuel container is held in position relative to the enclosure structure via neck mounting blocks and two aluminum alloy end bosses, each at opposite ends of the fuel container. The threaded fixed end boss is securely held in position, while the other floating end boss has some degree of freedom to allow for normal expansion and contraction with internal pressure and temperature changes. The complainant reports they are aware of five other trucks purchased by other customers from the same dealership that have experienced the same alleged condition. Furthermore, previous discussions with CCFT have revealed that they are also aware of other similar incidents.A fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source may result in a fire or explosion. To better understand the frequency, severity and scope of the alleged  condition, a Preliminary Evaluation (PE) is being opened.

The complaints allege that the engine fails to restart on its own from a complete stop at a traﬃc light or road intersection with the AIS function engaged. The subject vehicles are equipped with a 3.5L engine with a 9-speed automatic transmission.On January 6, 2023, Honda released service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009. These service bulletins address the failure to restart issue in the 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles, as well as the 2015-2020 Acura TLX, 2016-2020 Acura MDX, 2019-2022 Honda Passport, and 2020-2023 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.The repair outlined in the service bulletins is a two-stage countermeasure to remedy the issue. The first stage is a Programmed Fuel Injection (“PGM-FI”) software update. The second stage is only deployed if the software update fails to remedy the issue. The second stage, depending on the model and model year, consists of replacement of the starter assembly, starter relays, and a valve adjustment. Additionally, Honda extended the warranty coverage to 10 years with unlimited mileage for vehicles requiring the second stage component replacement.ODI continues to receive complaints of the AIS failure to restart, with many complainants alleging the campaign countermeasures had been completed.  NHTSA has reviewed Honda's Information Request Letter responses involving warranty claims, lawsuits, and consumer complaints in addition to ODI's own data.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further consider the potential safety defect, including gathering additional data regarding Honda’s service campaign efficacy.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the rear view camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Engineering Analysis (EA) is being opened to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"Crash incidents during Actually Smart Summon sessions

Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon are features on certain Tesla vehicles that allow a user to remotely move the vehicle to the user or to another designated location, through use of a phone app. The Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 1 complaint (VOQ) alleging that an Actually Smart Summon session resulted in a crash and has reviewed at least 3 media reports of apparently similar crashes. All four incidents involve the subject Tesla vehicles operating in Actually Smart Summon failing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash. Actually Smart Summon replaced Smart Summon and provided users with extended vehicle operating range while expanding vehicle connectivity through phone app live camera feeds and increased user latency experience. ODI has received 12 Smart Summon related VOQs alleging crash typology similar to the crashes experienced by users of Actually Smart Summon during sessions with little time for operators to react. ODI is aware of multiple crash allegations, involving both Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon, where the user had too little reaction time to avoid a crash, either with the available line of sight or releasing the phone app button, which stops the vehicle’s movement. Tesla has not reported any Smart Summon or Actually Smart Summon crashes through the Standing General Order for crashes involving ADS or Level 2 ADAS, which requires reporting of crashes on publicly accessible roads. ODI is opening this preliminary evaluation to investigate Actually Smart Summon’s capabilities as they relate to the subject and similar crashes, including the system's operation and ﬁeld performance in FSD equipped vehicles and vehicles included in free trial offers. NHTSA will evaluate the top speed that a vehicle can attain while Actually Smart Summon is engaged, designed-in operating restrictions for usage on public roads, and line of sight requirements. NHTSA expects this preliminary evaluation to include review of remote vehicle control through the phone app at various distances and lines of sight, including app connectivity delays resulting in increased stopping distance and the ability to utilize Actually Smart Summon in roadway environments or operating conditions for which the current version of the system is neither intended nor designed.  To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identiﬁcation Number document, go to NHTSA.gov. nan

"Loss of Motive Power

In January 2024, The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24002) to investigate allegations of loss of motive power in model year (MY) 2021 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles. In April 2024, Ford issued safety recall 24V-267 covering 456,565 MY 2021-2024 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022-2023 Ford Maverick vehicles. The recall addressed occurrences of loss of motive power resulting from sudden degradation of the 12V battery during the drive cycle. When the battery failure occurs, consumers may experience a complete loss of engine power without the ability to restart, accompanied by the loss of 12V accessories, including hazard lights. The recall remedy consists of software updates to the body control module and powertrain control module, which were designed to provide improved detection of the 12V battery state of charge during the drive cycle and provide warning to consumers if the battery is degraded.ODI has since received 15 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) describing loss of motive power incidents for MY 2021 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles that received the 24V-267 recall remedy. Consumers describe that prior to the loss of motive power, there were no warnings related to the 12V battery or vehicle electrical system. Additionally, multiple consumers reported that after the vehicle was towed to the dealership following the loss of motive power, the event was diagnosed to the 12V battery, and a battery replacement was the only required repair.ODI is opening this Recall Query on MY 2021-2024 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022-2023 Ford Maverick vehicles to assess the effectiveness of the 24V-267 recall remedy.

"Frame Flex on Grand Design Fifth Wheel Recreational Trailers

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received twenty-three complaints alleging excessive frame flex on model year 2017-2023 Grand Design fifth wheel recreational trailers, models Momentum and Solitude. Twenty-two of the complaints allege that excessive frame flex resulted in a cargo or entry door opening while in transit, some with objects lost on roadways, while six complaints also state that slideouts extended out partially.  ODI has been in contact with both Grand Design and Lippert, the frame manufacturer. Grand Design believes that some frame flex, generally considered to be vertical movement in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel, is normal. However, Grand Design has developed a technical service bulletin (TSB), to evaluate concerns of excessive frame flex, defined as vertical movement greater than 3/8 inch. Per Grand Design, the frame flex is only occurring in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel and is resulting in cosmetic defects such as moving sidewalls, damage to cabinets, binding doors, etc. However, Lippert believes that the effects of frame flex may also extend back to the front axle of the trailer.  While Lippert provides frames for multiple trailer manufacturers, the majority of complaints are for these Grand Design products.Cargo and entry doors that open and slideouts that extend while in transit increase the risk of injury or a crash. ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to determine whether an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety exists.To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan

"Semi-Trailer Side Underride Guards

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a petition from Eric Hein, Director of the Institute for Safer Trucking dated July 3, 2024, requesting an investigation of all van-type (also known as box) semi-trailers due to collisions with passenger vehicles and other vulnerable road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists) resulting in significant injuries or death due to the lack of side underride guards (SUGs). On August 26, 2024, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP24004 to evaluate the petitioner’s request. No trailer manufacturer or equipment supplier was identified as the specific subject of the petition. The petition itself can be reviewed at NHTSA.gov under ODI Number 11599188.Currently, a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) requiring side underride guards on semi-trailers does not exist. The petitioner contends that a failure to include side underride guards equates to a safety defect in the semi-trailer’s design, construction and performance. ODI was petitioned in 2021 for this same issue and, after evaluation, denied the request (DP21004). The petitioner here states that evidence of SUG effectiveness to prevent fatalities and mitigate serious injuries “has continued to accumulate” since the denial of DP21004. The petitioner also alleges that “[d]espite a high severity of risk resulting in frequent severe or fatal injuries from side underride crashes, NHTSA has taken no action to investigate recalling semi-trailers without SUGs.”Pursuant to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), NHTSA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that summarized and requested comment on a 2022 NHTSA report with an analysis of potential effects of a requirement for side underride guards on new trailers and semitrailers. 88 Fed. Reg. 24536 (Apr. 21, 2023). NHTSA’s Office of Rulemaking is currently reviewing over 2,000 comments received. Also pursuant to the IIJA, on June 18, 2024, the NHTSA-facilitated Advisory Committee on Underride Protection (ACUP) issued its biennial report to Congress and the Secretary of Transportation. This biennial report consists of a majority report and a minority report summarizing its work to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on safety regulations related to underride crashes that have caused severe injury and death. Though the committee’s charter was extended through June 2025, the committee concluded its work following the publication of the biennial report in June 2024.In addition, NHTSA previously announced several actions related to truck trailer underride safety, including improving data collection of underride crashes by recommending inclusion of underride data in state crash data systems and by providing educational materials to state and local police departments on identifying and recording underride crashes. ODI also actively participates in the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) events where it has encouraged law enforcement to report underride crashes, and proposed CVSA focus on underride guards during the 2024 Operation Road Check, a nationwide 72-hour safety blitz. NHTSA is, further, conducting research on rear impact guard designs that better protect occupants of passenger vehicles in even more rear underride crash scenarios. And NHTSA, with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, published a pamphlet in August 2022—which was distributed to law enforcement through various channels—that explains how to identify and record such crashes (this pamphlet is available at https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/les/2022-08/Underride-Crash- Pamphlet_071522_v6atag.pdf).ODI searched its databases and found no injury or fatality trend specific to any make, model, or model year trailer within Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) and Early Warning Reporting (EWR) data and found one EWR report of vulnerable road user injury or fatalities. ODI also met, separately, with Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. (UTM) and Auto Haulers Association of America regarding UTM’s SUG and to better understand the operational environment of low clearance vehicles, respectively. Based on the information available to the agency, trailer manufacturers continue to pursue side underride guard technology, and at least one manufacturer is currently offering an optional guard.The petitioner submitted two documents to ODI on September 11, 2024. The first was a letter from UTM to Marianne Karth (Petitioner of DP21004 & DP22004) which recounted UTM’s testing of SUGs. The second document was an information sheet generated by the petitioner contesting UTM’s claims. The petitioner also submitted certain documents to ODI on October 1, 2024, which the petitioner had previously submitted separately as part of comments on a collection of information pertaining to Reporting and Documents About Potential Defects (Docket No. NHTSA-2024-0055). This included 45 files regarding 49 unique crashes. ODI reviewed that information and found that of the 49 crashes, twenty-nine (29) potentially involved a subject vehicle. The majority of the 45 files were from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a NHTSA-maintained database of state crash data comprised of certain, albeit often relatively limited information. Notably, of the 29 files, only 2 included the make, model, and model year of the subject vehicle.After consideration of the petition, including the reports and documents provided by the petitioner, NHTSA believes the issues raised here are best addressed through its recent rulemaking and the ongoing actions under IIJA. Accordingly, NHTSA has decided not to open a defect investigation, and the petition is denied. The denial of this petition does not foreclose the agency from taking further action if warranted or making a future finding that a safety-related defect exists based upon additional information the agency may receive.nan

"Trailer Hitch Receiver Structure may Crack and Separate

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 5 complaints for various 2016-2022 Thor Motor Coach motorhomes alleging that the trailer hitch receiver (""hitch"") or recreational vehicle (RV) frame cracked and/or separated, including one which resulted in the towed item detaching and causing property damage. Other examples of hitch or frame cracking have been discovered prior to hitch separation.ODI has contacted the RV manufacturer, Thor, the frame extension manufacturer, Mor-Ryde, and the hitch manufacturer, Lippert, who, in response, allege that consumers are overloading the hitch. While the amount that a motorhome can tow must be calculated after determining the cargo, passenger and liquids weights, the hitch that failed had an 8,000lb limit and the vehicle it was flat-towing weighed approximately 4,000lbs.Hitch or frame cracking resulting in the towed item detaching and becoming loose on the roadway increases the risk of a crash to others on the roadway.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to determine whether an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety exists.

"Engine Stall With Intermittent Restart

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 80 consumer complaints alleging an engine stall and loss of motive power on model year (MY) 2022 RAM 1500 pickup trucks and 2022 Jeep Wagoneer SUV vehicles. The particular engines in the subject vehicles are equipped with the Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group LLC (FCA) 5.7L Hemi eTorque system. The eTorque system is a mild hybrid system that lets the vehicle partially power itself. It accomplishes this by converting the captured energy from the braking system into electricity for the battery pack, which is then used to power a variety of electrical components. ETorque engines replace the alternator with a 48-volt battery-powered belt drive and a motor generator. The motor generator provides extra torque to the crankshaft during gear changes. Simultaneously, the motor generator uses the 48-volt battery pack to increase torque. Many of the complaints state that the vehicle's engine would shut off, often while travelling at slow speed, the vehicle would shift into park and apply the emergency brake. The vehicles were sometimes able to be restarted. In addition, complaints state that the malfunction warning light with the battery fault symbol appeared on the dash.  Many complaints state that a low voltage condition fault is present, sometimes not being able to restart the vehicle. On April 13, 2023, FCA announced recall 23V-265 describing a defect in certain 2021 Ram 1500 vehicles equipped with 5.7L eTorque engines.  The recall described a defect in the powertrain control module software can cause an incorrect fuel mixture condition in the engine, and result in an engine stall. In February of 2024, ODI provided the complaints on the 2022 Ram 1500 and Wagoneer vehicles to FCA. After reviewing the complaints, FCA stated that “the loss of motive power was likely not caused by an over rich fuel condition (as outlined in recall 23V-265), but rather some other cause (e.g., an electrical concern that causes the engine to shut down).”   A Preliminary Evaluation has been opened to assess the scope, frequency, root cause(s) and consequences of these loss/stall of motive power incidents.  Additionally, ODI may expand the scope of the subject population during the investigation, if needed.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.RQ24011 is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25003) to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the Rear View Camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

On May 16, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened Recall Query (RQ) RQ24010 to investigate the remedy and scope of recalls 23V-213 and 23V-312. The affected vehicles by these recalls included model years (MY) 2021 through 2023 Volkswagen ID.4 vehicles. ODI received reports of the vehicle’s doors opening while the vehicle was in motion post recall remedy.  ODI, also, received similar allegations on vehicles that were outside the scope of the recalls.Volkswagen issued recall 23V-213 on March 29, 2023, and recall 23V-213 on May 03, 2023. These recalls addressed the defect of water ingress into the circuit board assembly of the door handle. Water ingress can cause communication issues between the door handle and the door control until. This malfunction resulted in the vehicle door inadvertently opening while the vehicle was in motion.Over the course of the investigation, ODI received 17 unique VIN VOQ complaints of the vehicle doors opening while the vehicle was in motion occurring either post recall remedy or on a vehicle that was outside the recall scope. Volkswagen submitted 190 unique VIN complaints reporting the same circumstances.   On September 4, 2024, Volkswagen submitted recall 24V-651 to address the issue of inadvertent opening of the door while the vehicle is in motion. The scope of this recall expands the affected vehicles to include all MY2021-2024 Volkswagen ID.4 models, including those remedied under the subject recalls. The recall remedy consists of replacement of the door handle assembly on all four doors as well as a software update.  The software update is performed to update the door handle parameters. The new door handle will have the membrane relocated to the back of the handle to avoid standing water within the handle.  Also, a protective coating will be on the front and back of the circuit board to avoid direct moisture formation.  In view of the action being taken by Volkswagen, Recall 24V-651, ODI is closing this Recall Query.  The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.To review the ODI reports cited in the Closing Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan

"Unexpected ADS behavior

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received reports of 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles equipped with Waymo’s 5th generation automated driving system (ADS) wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle was the sole vehicle operated during a collision or wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle exhibited driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws. Reports include collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains, collisions with parked vehicles, and instances in which the ADS appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices. In certain incidents, a collision occurred shortly after the ADS exhibited unexpected behavior near traffic safety control devices. Waymo submitted incident reports involving collisions to NHTSA under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO). Other incidents, such as vehicles driving in opposing lanes with nearby oncoming traffic or entering construction zones, were identified based on publicly available reports.Based on initial evaluation of these incidents, NHTSA understands that the Waymo ADS was either engaged throughout the incident or, in certain cases when supervised by an in-vehicle test driver, the ADS disengaged in the moments just before an incident occurred.ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation to investigate the Waymo 5th Generation ADS’s performance in the incidents identified in this resume and similar scenarios, as well as to more closely assess any commonalities in these incidents. The investigation will evaluate the ADS’s performance in detecting and responding to traffic control devices and in avoiding collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects and vehicles.    The SGO reports cited in the Opening Resume can be found by report identifiers listed below on NHTSA's SGO website: https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting#dataSGO 2021-01 report IDs:30270-116030270-122030270-149430270-436330270-508130270-531830270-575830270-613330270-654830270-656130270-683830270-698130270-704830270-705430270-705830270-730830270-731230270-7534nan

"Rear-end Collisions Involving Zoox Vehicles

On May 10, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24015) to assess reports of sudden unexpected braking in Zoox vehicles, leading to rear-end collisions, as well as to evaluate the performance of the Zoox Automated Driving System in crosswalks around vulnerable road users and in other similar rear-end collision scenarios. These unexpected braking events can increase the risk of a collision. To assess these risks, ODI collected information from Zoox as part of this investigation. In response to ODI’s Request for Information, Zoox provided information describing hard braking events commanded by the ADS. These hard braking events were identified by certain thresholds, including rate of deceleration. ODI analyzed the hard braking events commanded by the Zoox ADS and determined that Zoox ADS-equipped vehicles contributed to 4 collisions. Each of these collisions involved a vulnerable road user, with three of the incidents resulting in injury. Three of the collisions were reported under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), while the other collision was not reportable under the SGO.On March 13, 2025, Zoox ﬁled a safety recall (NHTSA Recall No. 25E019) stating that in specific circumstances “the Zoox ADS software may have reacted over-cautiously and braked unnecessarily hard” and that “the Zoox ADS software may have incorrectly anticipated a collision and braked unnecessarily hard.” These behaviors could lead to increased risk of a rear-end collision caused by unnecessary hard braking. The Zoox recall report indicated that Zoox's ADS has been remedied through a software update that addresses the described defects. As of November 7, 2024, the updated software was released to all impacted Zoox vehicles.In view of the recall action taken by Zoox and ODI’s analysis of the available data, including data presented by Zoox demonstrating a resolution of these hard braking incidents after the software update, ODI is closing this Preliminary Evaluation. NHTSA reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by new circumstances.To review the SGO reports cited above, go to NHTSA.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting.  The SGO report ID numbers are provided below:30610-7578     30610-7589     30610-4810    nan

"Inadvertent Automatic Emergency Braking

On May 8, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24013 to investigate reports of inadvertent activation of the automatic emergency braking (AEB) system in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. (Fisker). The complaints allege the activation of AEB without an apparent roadway obstruction in the vehicle’s forward path, resulting in sudden vehicle deceleration. This sudden deceleration occurs without adequate warning or input from the driver. The braking applications range from momentary, partial application resulting in rapid loss of speed to full application, which brings the vehicle to a complete stop in the travel lane.ODI sent Fisker an Information Request (IR) letter on May 20, 2024. On June 17 and 19, 2024, Fisker and its affiliates filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Fisker provided an incomplete response to the IR on July 1, 2024. Limited information pertaining to system validation and failure data was provided. Fisker subsequently requested more time to provide additional responsive files due to limited available resources. Fisker sent additional responsive files on September 9, 2024, September 17, 2024, and December 16, 2024, but Fisker’s response did not contain sufficient information for ODI to fully evaluate the alleged safety defect.Further, on December 27, 2024, the Fisker employees with whom ODI had been corresponding informed ODI that all Fisker employees were being “dismissed” as of that date. ODI therefore does not anticipate receiving any further responsive submissions such that it can fully evaluate the reports that led to this investigation. ODI performed phone interviews and sent a survey to consumers to obtain more information and validate the allegations. Additionally, ODI reviewed allegations of the alleged safety defect that were submitted to various online forums. Most of these reports were similar in nature to the reports received by ODI. Some of the reports in online forums appear to be duplicative reports that were also submitted to ODI. Based on the responses received and analysis of similar online reporting, there was no clear trend in the following factors pertaining to the allegations: reoccurrence of events (i.e., single or multiple incidents), speed immediately prior to the event, whether the event concluded in a reduction of speed or a full stop, roadway conditions, and warning immediately prior to the event.To date, between the reports provided by Fisker and complaints made directly to the agency, ODI is aware of over 20 reports alleging inadvertent AEB activation. Before the employees were dismissed, Fisker’s testing done in response to the inadvertent AEB allegations reportedly did not result in any inadvertent AEB activations. The “Manufacturer” and “Total” counts in the above table have been left blank because of a pending request for confidential treatment by Fisker that could not be timely addressed given the company’s status. This information factored into ODI’s investigation and analysis.The available information does not warrant further action at this time.  The closing of this investigation does not constitute a finding by NHTSA that a safety-related defect does not exist. Additionally, the Agency notes that the Vehicle Safety Act states: “A manufacturer’s filing of a petition in bankruptcy under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title 11 does not negate the manufacturer’s duty to comply with section 30112 or sections 30115 through 30120 of this title,” which include the recall provisions of the Act.

"Recall 23V838 Remedy Effectiveness

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is opening a Recall Query to assess the remedy adequacy of Recall 23V838. On December 12, 2023, Tesla filed a Defect Information Report (Recall 23V838) applicable to all Tesla models produced and equipped with any version of its Autopilot system, which Tesla described as an SAE Level 2 (L2) Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Autopilot is the simultaneous engagement of Tesla’s Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) and Autosteer. In describing the safety defect, Tesla’s Defect Information Report (DIR) explained that “the prominence and scope of the system’s controls may be insufficient to prevent driver misuse,” and Tesla committed to the deployment of a multipart remedy aimed at improving system and engagement controls and reducing mode confusion.EA22002 (upgraded from PE21020) was opened to investigate whether Tesla’s Autopilot contained a defect that created an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety and involved extensive crash analysis, human factors analysis, vehicle evaluations, and assessment of vehicle control authority and driver engagement technologies. The work conducted in these investigations aligns with Tesla’s conclusion in its 23V838 recall filing. During EA22002, ODI identified at least 13 crashes involving one or more fatalities and many more involving serious injuries in which foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.  Tesla filed Recall 23V838 to address concerns regarding the Autopilot system investigated in EA22002. Following deployment of the remedy in Recall 23V838, ODI identified concerns due to post-remedy crash events and results from preliminary NHTSA tests of remedied vehicles. Also, Tesla has stated that a portion of the remedy both requires the owner to opt in and allows a driver to readily reverse it. Tesla has also deployed non-remedy updates to address issues that appear related to ODI’s concerns under EA22002. This investigation will consider why these updates were not a part of the recall or otherwise determined to remedy a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk. ODI is therefore opening this Recall Query investigation to further evaluate the adequacy of the remedy for recall 23V838.nan

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Preliminary Evaluation is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25001) to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"Electronic Brake Module Component Failure

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received multiple Early Warning Reporting field reports alleging a loss of brake boost assist in MY2023 Cadillac LYRIQ vehicles. The reports allege a hard brake pedal, followed by a “Brake System Failure” message at start up or while driving. The EWR field reports have been verified by General Motors (GM). GM stated the electronic brake control module, also known as “eBoost”, has an internal spindle that can fracture during an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) event. GM further stated that due to the fracture, the vehicles can lose brake assist, experience speed limitation, and ABS would lose some functionality.GM indicated a new material clean break point was introduced in the assembly plants in May 2023.  GM has also developed an over the air (OTA) update, which will cycle the brake booster similarly to an ABS event at start-up for every key cycle. If the spindle fractures during this start-up cycling, a warning lamp will illuminate to prompt the customer to bring the vehicle to the dealership to be diagnosed and repaired under warranty. This software update was not conducted as a recall.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to determine the scope and severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related issues.nan

"Under hood fires caused by fuel leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) reviewed Ford Motor Company’s (Ford’s) proposed remedy for recall 24V-187. ODI evaluated information from Ford concerning the recall remedy for the involved vehicles.Ford issued recall 24V-187 on March 8, 2024, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2022-2023 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022 Ford Escape vehicles equipped with 1.5L engines. Recall 24V-187 states that a fuel injector may crack resulting in liquid fuel and/or fuel vapor migration to, and accumulation near, ignition sources that may cause an under hood fire, fuel odor both outside and inside of the vehicle, and increase the risk of injury. Recall 24V-187 further states that a cracked fuel injector in the engine allows for fuel to leak at a high rate into the cylinder head, which can travel out via a drain hole and down onto hot surfaces on the exhaust and/or turbo system.The recall remedy for 24V-187 involves 1) an engine control software update and 2) installation of a drain tube. The engine control software update will detect a pressure drop in the fuel rail providing a “seek service” message within the vehicle’s instrument cluster, as well as invoke a strategy to disable the high-pressure fuel pump, de-rate engine power output, and reduce temperatures of possible ignition sources in the engine compartment. The drain tube will allow fuel to drain from the cylinder head hole to the ground below the vehicle away from surfaces which may initiate combustion. The recall remedy does not include replacement of the cracked fuel injector.On November 18, 2022, recall 22V-859 was issued involving MY 2020-2023 Ford Escape and MY 2021-2023 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles.

"Front Seat Belt Assemblies may be Missing the Rivet that Secures the Quick Connector and Wire Plate

On April 4, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened RQ24006 to investigate American Honda Motor Co.’s (Honda’s) proposed remedy for recall 23V-782 as well as scope of the vehicles involved.Honda issued recall 23V-782 on November 21, 2023, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2023-2024 Honda Accord, Honda Accord Hybrid, and Honda HR-V vehicles. Recall 23V-782 states that the driver and front passenger seat belt pretensioner assemblies may have been manufactured without a rivet that secures the pretensioner quick connector and wire plate. Recall documentation states that seat belt pretensioner assemblies that are missing the rivet will not properly restrain the occupant in the event of a collision, increasing the risk of injury.  Subject defective seat belt assemblies are installed as original equipment for both the driver and front passenger positions for the HR-V, but only for the driver position for the Accord and Accord Hybrid.The recall remedy for 23V-782 instructs the technician to inspect both front seat belt pretensioner assemblies and, if necessary, replace them. The inspection procedure requires the technician to utilize a pull force gauge to determine whether the subject component is missing the subject rivet and requires replacement. Parts requiring replacement are determined by whether the pretensioner quick connector separates from the pretensioner assembly while the technician is pulling on the seat belt. If no separation occurs, then the part is determined to be not defective and not require replacement.There have been no reports alleging a failure of seat belt pretensioner assemblies after the inspect and replace remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed. Additionally, no comparable failures have been observed in field data for similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall. As of the 4th quarter of 2024, the recall completion rate is at approximately 84% of the total recalled population.In view of the lack of failures after the remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed, and the lack of failures in similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ).

"Failure to open door

On April 1, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24010 to investigate instances of failure to open the door in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. Some complaints allege the inability to open the door from either the interior or exterior door handle, resulting in the need to use another door to egress.The investigation revealed that all four exterior door handles are subject to sticking in the extended/unlocked position, which may result in the inability to unlatch the door from either the interior or exterior door handle. The root cause is a dimensional interference between the exterior door handle chassis pocket and door handle, causing friction during handle deployment and retraction. The inability to open and egress from the occupant’s adjacent door presents an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety.On June 27, 2024, Fisker filed recall 24V-466 for certain MY 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles.

"Unintended Transmission Downshift

In September 2016, Ford Motor Company (Ford) issued safety recall 16V-248 which included certain model year (MY) 2011-2012 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions. This recall was in response to allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, increasing the risk of a crash and/or injury, and included approximately 153,581 vehicles. Ford identified the root cause of the unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear to be intermittent signal loss from the transmission’s Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor due to solder joint cracks on the OSS circuit board as a result of manufacturing process issues. The OSS sensor is mounted onto the molded lead frame and transmits changes in transmission shaft speed to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). The remedy program described in safety recall 16V-248 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring.In December 2017, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ17-010) to assess the scope and remedy effectiveness of safety recall 16V-248. As a result of this ODI investigation, Ford issued safety recall 19V-075 to expand the scope of 16V-248 to include MY 2011-2013 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions and included approximately 1,263,051 vehicles. The remedy program described in safety recall 19V-075 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring. In June 2019, Ford issued safety recall 19V-433 as the remedy program used to service MY 2013 Ford F-150 5.0L and 6.2L vehicles in accordance with safety recall 19V-075 did not contain the necessary updates to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 107,857 vehicles.On March 27, 2024, ODI opened this Recall Query (RQ24-005) to investigate the scope of the above-described safety recalls. At the time that this investigation was opened, ODI had received 86 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) reporting allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, in MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles. As a result of this Recall Query, Ford filled safety recall 24V-444 on June 14, 2024, to include MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles and expand the scope of safety recalls 16V-248, 19V-075 and 19V-433. The remedy program described in safety recall 24V-444 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 552,188 vehicles.In its May 2024 response to ODI’s information request, Ford concluded that a predominant root cause for the intermittent OSS signal loss has not been identified outside of the original safety recall (16V-248). Ford’s investigation also concluded that the primary causes of the defect in MY 2014 F-150 vehicles were related to the molded lead frame and the control assembly transmission main. In the May 2024 response, Ford identified 2,184 total reports that described unintended vehicle transmission downshifting and rear wheel lock-up events; 1,441 warranty claims and 743 reports from consumer complaints, field reports, consumer surveys, and lawsuits/legal claims. Note that the values presented here and in the table above represent the total number of reports which can include a single consumer with multiple reports of the same event as well as a consumer with reports of multiple distinct events. Of the 1,441 warranty claims, 551 warranty claims involved repair of the molded lead frame (38%) and 509 warranty claims involved repair of the control assembly transmission main (35%).Ford has also stated that the PCM programming used to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting was implemented starting with MY 2015 vehicle #1 production and onward.In view of the safety recall action being taken by Ford, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ24-005). The agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Fuel Leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a complaint alleging a compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel leak from a Luxfer Type 4 CNG 60 diesel gallon equivalent (DGE) 26x108 size fuel container.  The container was used in a system built and installed by Natural Gas Fuel Systems, LLC, dba Cummins Clean Fuel Technologies (CCFT).  A strong odor alerted the driver of the fuel leak, which occurred at a fracture at the fuel container's threaded aluminum alloy fixed end boss.The fuel container is positioned longitudinally within an enclosure structure that is attached to the truck's passenger side frame rail in a side-mount configuration. The fuel container is held in position relative to the enclosure structure via neck mounting blocks and two aluminum alloy end bosses, each at opposite ends of the fuel container. The threaded fixed end boss is securely held in position, while the other floating end boss has some degree of freedom to allow for normal expansion and contraction with internal pressure and temperature changes. The complainant reports they are aware of five other trucks purchased by other customers from the same dealership that have experienced the same alleged condition. Furthermore, previous discussions with CCFT have revealed that they are also aware of other similar incidents.A fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source may result in a fire or explosion. To better understand the frequency, severity and scope of the alleged  condition, a Preliminary Evaluation (PE) is being opened.

"No Restart After Auto Start/Stop Engages

On June 3, 2022, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened Preliminary Evaluation PE22005 after the agency received VOQs and several ﬁeld reports concerning the Auto Idle Stop (AIS) feature on 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles. The complaints allege that the engine fails to restart on its own from a complete stop at a traﬃc light or road intersection with the AIS function engaged. The subject vehicles are equipped with a 3.5L engine with a 9-speed automatic transmission.On January 6, 2023, Honda released service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009. These service bulletins address the failure to restart issue in the 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles, as well as the 2015-2020 Acura TLX, 2016-2020 Acura MDX, 2019-2022 Honda Passport, and 2020-2023 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.The repair outlined in the service bulletins is a two-stage countermeasure to remedy the issue. The first stage is a Programmed Fuel Injection (“PGM-FI”) software update. The second stage is only deployed if the software update fails to remedy the issue. The second stage, depending on the model and model year, consists of replacement of the starter assembly, starter relays, and a valve adjustment. Additionally, Honda extended the warranty coverage to 10 years with unlimited mileage for vehicles requiring the second stage component replacement.ODI continues to receive complaints of the AIS failure to restart, with many complainants alleging the campaign countermeasures had been completed.  NHTSA has reviewed Honda's Information Request Letter responses involving warranty claims, lawsuits, and consumer complaints in addition to ODI's own data.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further consider the potential safety defect, including gathering additional data regarding Honda’s service campaign efficacy. ODI is additionally expanding the scope to encompass all vehicles addressed in Honda’s service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009 as well as newer model year vehicles, which are substantially similar to the vehicles covered by the service campaign.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the rear view camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Engineering Analysis (EA) is being opened to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"EVDM connector plate separation

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is aware of Electric Vehicle Distribution Module (EVDM) connector plate separation on Model Year (MY) 2020-2025 Freightliner eCascadia and MY 2022-2025 eM2 electric trucks. The EVDM connector plate contains multiple safety-related circuits including ABS, stability control and vehicle protective mechanisms to de-energize the High Voltage system. Separation of the EVDM connector plate can result in a loss of propulsion and increase the risk of a crash.An ODI review of Early Warning Reporting (EWR) submissions by Daimler Truck North America (DTNA) identified  vehicles describing Controller Area Network (CAN) and power faults caused by EVDM connector plate separation.To better understand the severity and frequency of EVDM connector plate separation on the subject vehicles, a Preliminary Evaluation (PE) is being opened.nan

"FSD Collisions in Reduced Roadway Visibility Conditions

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has identified four Standing General Order (SGO) reports in which a Tesla vehicle experienced a crash after entering an area of reduced roadway visibility conditions with FSD -Beta or FSD -Supervised (collectively, FSD) engaged. In these crashes, the reduced roadway visibility arose from conditions such as sun glare, fog, or airborne dust. In one of the crashes, the Tesla vehicle fatally struck a pedestrian. One additional crash in these conditions involved a reported injury. The four SGO crash reports are listed at the end of this summary by SGO number.ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation of FSD (a system labeled by Tesla as a partial driving automation system),which is optionally available in the Model Year (MY) 2016-2024 Models S and X, 2017-2024 Model 3, 2020-2024 Model Y, and 2023-2024 Cybertruck. This Preliminary Evaluation is opened to assess: -	The ability of FSD’s engineering controls to detect and respond appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions; -	Whether any other similar FSD crashes have occurred in reduced roadway visibility conditions and, if so, the contributing circumstances for those crashes; and -	Any updates or modifications from Tesla to the FSD system that may affect the performance of FSD in reduced roadway visibility conditions. In particular, this review will assess the timing, purpose, and capabilities of any such updates, as well as Tesla’s assessment of their safety impact.SGO Report numbers: 13781-8004, 13781-7181, 13781-7381, 13781-7767.

"Frame Flex on Grand Design Fifth Wheel Recreational Trailers

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received twenty-three complaints alleging excessive frame flex on model year 2017-2023 Grand Design fifth wheel recreational trailers, models Momentum and Solitude. Twenty-two of the complaints allege that excessive frame flex resulted in a cargo or entry door opening while in transit, some with objects lost on roadways, while six complaints also state that slideouts extended out partially.  ODI has been in contact with both Grand Design and Lippert, the frame manufacturer. Grand Design believes that some frame flex, generally considered to be vertical movement in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel, is normal. However, Grand Design has developed a technical service bulletin (TSB), to evaluate concerns of excessive frame flex, defined as vertical movement greater than 3/8 inch. Per Grand Design, the frame flex is only occurring in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel and is resulting in cosmetic defects such as moving sidewalls, damage to cabinets, binding doors, etc. However, Lippert believes that the effects of frame flex may also extend back to the front axle of the trailer.  While Lippert provides frames for multiple trailer manufacturers, the majority of complaints are for these Grand Design products.Cargo and entry doors that open and slideouts that extend while in transit increase the risk of injury or a crash. ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to determine whether an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety exists.To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan

"Semi-Trailer Side Underride Guards

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a petition from Eric Hein, Director of the Institute for Safer Trucking dated July 3, 2024, requesting an investigation of all van-type (also known as box) semi-trailers due to collisions with passenger vehicles and other vulnerable road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists) resulting in significant injuries or death due to the lack of side underride guards (SUGs). On August 26, 2024, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP24004 to evaluate the petitioner’s request. No trailer manufacturer or equipment supplier was identified as the specific subject of the petition. The petition itself can be reviewed at NHTSA.gov under ODI Number 11599188.Currently, a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) requiring side underride guards on semi-trailers does not exist. The petitioner contends that a failure to include side underride guards equates to a safety defect in the semi-trailer’s design, construction and performance. ODI was petitioned in 2021 for this same issue and, after evaluation, denied the request (DP21004). The petitioner here states that evidence of SUG effectiveness to prevent fatalities and mitigate serious injuries “has continued to accumulate” since the denial of DP21004. The petitioner also alleges that “[d]espite a high severity of risk resulting in frequent severe or fatal injuries from side underride crashes, NHTSA has taken no action to investigate recalling semi-trailers without SUGs.”Pursuant to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), NHTSA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that summarized and requested comment on a 2022 NHTSA report with an analysis of potential effects of a requirement for side underride guards on new trailers and semitrailers. 88 Fed. Reg. 24536 (Apr. 21, 2023). NHTSA’s Office of Rulemaking is currently reviewing over 2,000 comments received. Also pursuant to the IIJA, on June 18, 2024, the NHTSA-facilitated Advisory Committee on Underride Protection (ACUP) issued its biennial report to Congress and the Secretary of Transportation. This biennial report consists of a majority report and a minority report summarizing its work to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on safety regulations related to underride crashes that have caused severe injury and death. Though the committee’s charter was extended through June 2025, the committee concluded its work following the publication of the biennial report in June 2024.In addition, NHTSA previously announced several actions related to truck trailer underride safety, including improving data collection of underride crashes by recommending inclusion of underride data in state crash data systems and by providing educational materials to state and local police departments on identifying and recording underride crashes. ODI also actively participates in the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) events where it has encouraged law enforcement to report underride crashes, and proposed CVSA focus on underride guards during the 2024 Operation Road Check, a nationwide 72-hour safety blitz. NHTSA is, further, conducting research on rear impact guard designs that better protect occupants of passenger vehicles in even more rear underride crash scenarios. And NHTSA, with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, published a pamphlet in August 2022—which was distributed to law enforcement through various channels—that explains how to identify and record such crashes (this pamphlet is available at https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/les/2022-08/Underride-Crash- Pamphlet_071522_v6atag.pdf).ODI searched its databases and found no injury or fatality trend specific to any make, model, or model year trailer within Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) and Early Warning Reporting (EWR) data and found one EWR report of vulnerable road user injury or fatalities. ODI also met, separately, with Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. (UTM) and Auto Haulers Association of America regarding UTM’s SUG and to better understand the operational environment of low clearance vehicles, respectively. Based on the information available to the agency, trailer manufacturers continue to pursue side underride guard technology, and at least one manufacturer is currently offering an optional guard.The petitioner submitted two documents to ODI on September 11, 2024. The first was a letter from UTM to Marianne Karth (Petitioner of DP21004 & DP22004) which recounted UTM’s testing of SUGs. The second document was an information sheet generated by the petitioner contesting UTM’s claims. The petitioner also submitted certain documents to ODI on October 1, 2024, which the petitioner had previously submitted separately as part of comments on a collection of information pertaining to Reporting and Documents About Potential Defects (Docket No. NHTSA-2024-0055). This included 45 files regarding 49 unique crashes. ODI reviewed that information and found that of the 49 crashes, twenty-nine (29) potentially involved a subject vehicle. The majority of the 45 files were from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a NHTSA-maintained database of state crash data comprised of certain, albeit often relatively limited information. Notably, of the 29 files, only 2 included the make, model, and model year of the subject vehicle.After consideration of the petition, including the reports and documents provided by the petitioner, NHTSA believes the issues raised here are best addressed through its recent rulemaking and the ongoing actions under IIJA. Accordingly, NHTSA has decided not to open a defect investigation, and the petition is denied. The denial of this petition does not foreclose the agency from taking further action if warranted or making a future finding that a safety-related defect exists based upon additional information the agency may receive.nan

"Engine Stall With Intermittent Restart

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 80 consumer complaints alleging an engine stall and loss of motive power on model year (MY) 2022 RAM 1500 pickup trucks and 2022 Jeep Wagoneer SUV vehicles. The particular engines in the subject vehicles are equipped with the Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group LLC (FCA) 5.7L Hemi eTorque system. The eTorque system is a mild hybrid system that lets the vehicle partially power itself. It accomplishes this by converting the captured energy from the braking system into electricity for the battery pack, which is then used to power a variety of electrical components. ETorque engines replace the alternator with a 48-volt battery-powered belt drive and a motor generator. The motor generator provides extra torque to the crankshaft during gear changes. Simultaneously, the motor generator uses the 48-volt battery pack to increase torque. Many of the complaints state that the vehicle's engine would shut off, often while travelling at slow speed, the vehicle would shift into park and apply the emergency brake. The vehicles were sometimes able to be restarted. In addition, complaints state that the malfunction warning light with the battery fault symbol appeared on the dash.  Many complaints state that a low voltage condition fault is present, sometimes not being able to restart the vehicle. On April 13, 2023, FCA announced recall 23V-265 describing a defect in certain 2021 Ram 1500 vehicles equipped with 5.7L eTorque engines.  The recall described a defect in the powertrain control module software can cause an incorrect fuel mixture condition in the engine, and result in an engine stall. In February of 2024, ODI provided the complaints on the 2022 Ram 1500 and Wagoneer vehicles to FCA. After reviewing the complaints, FCA stated that “the loss of motive power was likely not caused by an over rich fuel condition (as outlined in recall 23V-265), but rather some other cause (e.g., an electrical concern that causes the engine to shut down).”   A Preliminary Evaluation has been opened to assess the scope, frequency, root cause(s) and consequences of these loss/stall of motive power incidents.  Additionally, ODI may expand the scope of the subject population during the investigation, if needed.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.RQ24011 is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25003) to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the Rear View Camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

On May 16, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened Recall Query (RQ) RQ24010 to investigate the remedy and scope of recalls 23V-213 and 23V-312. The affected vehicles by these recalls included model years (MY) 2021 through 2023 Volkswagen ID.4 vehicles. ODI received reports of the vehicle’s doors opening while the vehicle was in motion post recall remedy.  ODI, also, received similar allegations on vehicles that were outside the scope of the recalls.Volkswagen issued recall 23V-213 on March 29, 2023, and recall 23V-213 on May 03, 2023. These recalls addressed the defect of water ingress into the circuit board assembly of the door handle. Water ingress can cause communication issues between the door handle and the door control until. This malfunction resulted in the vehicle door inadvertently opening while the vehicle was in motion.Over the course of the investigation, ODI received 17 unique VIN VOQ complaints of the vehicle doors opening while the vehicle was in motion occurring either post recall remedy or on a vehicle that was outside the recall scope. Volkswagen submitted 190 unique VIN complaints reporting the same circumstances.   On September 4, 2024, Volkswagen submitted recall 24V-651 to address the issue of inadvertent opening of the door while the vehicle is in motion. The scope of this recall expands the affected vehicles to include all MY2021-2024 Volkswagen ID.4 models, including those remedied under the subject recalls. The recall remedy consists of replacement of the door handle assembly on all four doors as well as a software update.  The software update is performed to update the door handle parameters. The new door handle will have the membrane relocated to the back of the handle to avoid standing water within the handle.  Also, a protective coating will be on the front and back of the circuit board to avoid direct moisture formation.  In view of the action being taken by Volkswagen, Recall 24V-651, ODI is closing this Recall Query.  The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.To review the ODI reports cited in the Closing Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan

"Unexpected ADS behavior

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received reports of 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles equipped with Waymo’s 5th generation automated driving system (ADS) wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle was the sole vehicle operated during a collision or wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle exhibited driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws. Reports include collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains, collisions with parked vehicles, and instances in which the ADS appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices. In certain incidents, a collision occurred shortly after the ADS exhibited unexpected behavior near traffic safety control devices. Waymo submitted incident reports involving collisions to NHTSA under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO). Other incidents, such as vehicles driving in opposing lanes with nearby oncoming traffic or entering construction zones, were identified based on publicly available reports.Based on initial evaluation of these incidents, NHTSA understands that the Waymo ADS was either engaged throughout the incident or, in certain cases when supervised by an in-vehicle test driver, the ADS disengaged in the moments just before an incident occurred.ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation to investigate the Waymo 5th Generation ADS’s performance in the incidents identified in this resume and similar scenarios, as well as to more closely assess any commonalities in these incidents. The investigation will evaluate the ADS’s performance in detecting and responding to traffic control devices and in avoiding collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects and vehicles.    The SGO reports cited in the Opening Resume can be found by report identifiers listed below on NHTSA's SGO website: https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting#dataSGO 2021-01 report IDs:30270-116030270-122030270-149430270-436330270-508130270-531830270-575830270-613330270-654830270-656130270-683830270-698130270-704830270-705430270-705830270-730830270-731230270-7534nan

"Rear-end Collisions Involving Zoox Vehicles

On May 10, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24015) to assess reports of sudden unexpected braking in Zoox vehicles, leading to rear-end collisions, as well as to evaluate the performance of the Zoox Automated Driving System in crosswalks around vulnerable road users and in other similar rear-end collision scenarios. These unexpected braking events can increase the risk of a collision. To assess these risks, ODI collected information from Zoox as part of this investigation. In response to ODI’s Request for Information, Zoox provided information describing hard braking events commanded by the ADS. These hard braking events were identified by certain thresholds, including rate of deceleration. ODI analyzed the hard braking events commanded by the Zoox ADS and determined that Zoox ADS-equipped vehicles contributed to 4 collisions. Each of these collisions involved a vulnerable road user, with three of the incidents resulting in injury. Three of the collisions were reported under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), while the other collision was not reportable under the SGO.On March 13, 2025, Zoox ﬁled a safety recall (NHTSA Recall No. 25E019) stating that in specific circumstances “the Zoox ADS software may have reacted over-cautiously and braked unnecessarily hard” and that “the Zoox ADS software may have incorrectly anticipated a collision and braked unnecessarily hard.” These behaviors could lead to increased risk of a rear-end collision caused by unnecessary hard braking. The Zoox recall report indicated that Zoox's ADS has been remedied through a software update that addresses the described defects. As of November 7, 2024, the updated software was released to all impacted Zoox vehicles.In view of the recall action taken by Zoox and ODI’s analysis of the available data, including data presented by Zoox demonstrating a resolution of these hard braking incidents after the software update, ODI is closing this Preliminary Evaluation.

Of these complaints, 12 describe an engine compartment fire. The proximity of the secondary fuel filter to high heat sources creates a potential for autoignition thermal events and fires. ODI has contacted the vehicle manufacturer, Ford, and the filter manufacturer, Allevard Sogefi USA (Sogefi), and learned that the low-pressure fuel system is capable of a maximum operating pressure of 8.5 Bar, while the secondary fuel filter is only tested to seven (7) Bar during the manufacturing process. Additionally, changes starting in 2022 by both Ford and Sogefi align with a lack of similar complaints on MY 2022 and newer vehicles.

"Inadvertent Automatic Emergency Braking

On May 8, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24013 to investigate reports of inadvertent activation of the automatic emergency braking (AEB) system in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. (Fisker). The complaints allege the activation of AEB without an apparent roadway obstruction in the vehicle’s forward path, resulting in sudden vehicle deceleration. This sudden deceleration occurs without adequate warning or input from the driver. The braking applications range from momentary, partial application resulting in rapid loss of speed to full application, which brings the vehicle to a complete stop in the travel lane.ODI sent Fisker an Information Request (IR) letter on May 20, 2024. On June 17 and 19, 2024, Fisker and its affiliates filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Fisker provided an incomplete response to the IR on July 1, 2024. Limited information pertaining to system validation and failure data was provided. Fisker subsequently requested more time to provide additional responsive files due to limited available resources. Fisker sent additional responsive files on September 9, 2024, September 17, 2024, and December 16, 2024, but Fisker’s response did not contain sufficient information for ODI to fully evaluate the alleged safety defect.Further, on December 27, 2024, the Fisker employees with whom ODI had been corresponding informed ODI that all Fisker employees were being “dismissed” as of that date. ODI therefore does not anticipate receiving any further responsive submissions such that it can fully evaluate the reports that led to this investigation. ODI performed phone interviews and sent a survey to consumers to obtain more information and validate the allegations. Additionally, ODI reviewed allegations of the alleged safety defect that were submitted to various online forums. Most of these reports were similar in nature to the reports received by ODI. Some of the reports in online forums appear to be duplicative reports that were also submitted to ODI. Based on the responses received and analysis of similar online reporting, there was no clear trend in the following factors pertaining to the allegations: reoccurrence of events (i.e., single or multiple incidents), speed immediately prior to the event, whether the event concluded in a reduction of speed or a full stop, roadway conditions, and warning immediately prior to the event.To date, between the reports provided by Fisker and complaints made directly to the agency, ODI is aware of over 20 reports alleging inadvertent AEB activation. Before the employees were dismissed, Fisker’s testing done in response to the inadvertent AEB allegations reportedly did not result in any inadvertent AEB activations. The “Manufacturer” and “Total” counts in the above table have been left blank because of a pending request for confidential treatment by Fisker that could not be timely addressed given the company’s status. This information factored into ODI’s investigation and analysis.The available information does not warrant further action at this time.  The closing of this investigation does not constitute a finding by NHTSA that a safety-related defect does not exist. Additionally, the Agency notes that the Vehicle Safety Act states: “A manufacturer’s filing of a petition in bankruptcy under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title 11 does not negate the manufacturer’s duty to comply with section 30112 or sections 30115 through 30120 of this title,” which include the recall provisions of the Act. The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Recall 23V838 Remedy Effectiveness

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is opening a Recall Query to assess the remedy adequacy of Recall 23V838. On December 12, 2023, Tesla filed a Defect Information Report (Recall 23V838) applicable to all Tesla models produced and equipped with any version of its Autopilot system, which Tesla described as an SAE Level 2 (L2) Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Autopilot is the simultaneous engagement of Tesla’s Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) and Autosteer. In describing the safety defect, Tesla’s Defect Information Report (DIR) explained that “the prominence and scope of the system’s controls may be insufficient to prevent driver misuse,” and Tesla committed to the deployment of a multipart remedy aimed at improving system and engagement controls and reducing mode confusion.EA22002 (upgraded from PE21020) was opened to investigate whether Tesla’s Autopilot contained a defect that created an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety and involved extensive crash analysis, human factors analysis, vehicle evaluations, and assessment of vehicle control authority and driver engagement technologies. The work conducted in these investigations aligns with Tesla’s conclusion in its 23V838 recall filing. During EA22002, ODI identified at least 13 crashes involving one or more fatalities and many more involving serious injuries in which foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.  Tesla filed Recall 23V838 to address concerns regarding the Autopilot system investigated in EA22002. Following deployment of the remedy in Recall 23V838, ODI identified concerns due to post-remedy crash events and results from preliminary NHTSA tests of remedied vehicles. Also, Tesla has stated that a portion of the remedy both requires the owner to opt in and allows a driver to readily reverse it. Tesla has also deployed non-remedy updates to address issues that appear related to ODI’s concerns under EA22002. This investigation will consider why these updates were not a part of the recall or otherwise determined to remedy a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk. ODI is therefore opening this Recall Query investigation to further evaluate the adequacy of the remedy for recall 23V838.nan

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Preliminary Evaluation is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25001) to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"Electronic Brake Module Component Failure

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received multiple Early Warning Reporting field reports alleging a loss of brake boost assist in MY2023 Cadillac LYRIQ vehicles. The reports allege a hard brake pedal, followed by a “Brake System Failure” message at start up or while driving. The EWR field reports have been verified by General Motors (GM). GM stated the electronic brake control module, also known as “eBoost”, has an internal spindle that can fracture during an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) event. GM further stated that due to the fracture, the vehicles can lose brake assist, experience speed limitation, and ABS would lose some functionality.GM indicated a new material clean break point was introduced in the assembly plants in May 2023.  GM has also developed an over the air (OTA) update, which will cycle the brake booster similarly to an ABS event at start-up for every key cycle. If the spindle fractures during this start-up cycling, a warning lamp will illuminate to prompt the customer to bring the vehicle to the dealership to be diagnosed and repaired under warranty. This software update was not conducted as a recall.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to determine the scope and severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related issues.nan

"Under hood fires caused by fuel leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) reviewed Ford Motor Company’s (Ford’s) proposed remedy for recall 24V-187. ODI evaluated information from Ford concerning the recall remedy for the involved vehicles.Ford issued recall 24V-187 on March 8, 2024, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2022-2023 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022 Ford Escape vehicles equipped with 1.5L engines. Recall 24V-187 states that a fuel injector may crack resulting in liquid fuel and/or fuel vapor migration to, and accumulation near, ignition sources that may cause an under hood fire, fuel odor both outside and inside of the vehicle, and increase the risk of injury. Recall 24V-187 further states that a cracked fuel injector in the engine allows for fuel to leak at a high rate into the cylinder head, which can travel out via a drain hole and down onto hot surfaces on the exhaust and/or turbo system.The recall remedy for 24V-187 involves 1) an engine control software update and 2) installation of a drain tube. The engine control software update will detect a pressure drop in the fuel rail providing a “seek service” message within the vehicle’s instrument cluster, as well as invoke a strategy to disable the high-pressure fuel pump, de-rate engine power output, and reduce temperatures of possible ignition sources in the engine compartment. The drain tube will allow fuel to drain from the cylinder head hole to the ground below the vehicle away from surfaces which may initiate combustion. The recall remedy does not include replacement of the cracked fuel injector.On November 18, 2022, recall 22V-859 was issued involving MY 2020-2023 Ford Escape and MY 2021-2023 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles.

"Front Seat Belt Assemblies may be Missing the Rivet that Secures the Quick Connector and Wire Plate

On April 4, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened RQ24006 to investigate American Honda Motor Co.’s (Honda’s) proposed remedy for recall 23V-782 as well as scope of the vehicles involved.Honda issued recall 23V-782 on November 21, 2023, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2023-2024 Honda Accord, Honda Accord Hybrid, and Honda HR-V vehicles. Recall 23V-782 states that the driver and front passenger seat belt pretensioner assemblies may have been manufactured without a rivet that secures the pretensioner quick connector and wire plate. Recall documentation states that seat belt pretensioner assemblies that are missing the rivet will not properly restrain the occupant in the event of a collision, increasing the risk of injury.  Subject defective seat belt assemblies are installed as original equipment for both the driver and front passenger positions for the HR-V, but only for the driver position for the Accord and Accord Hybrid.The recall remedy for 23V-782 instructs the technician to inspect both front seat belt pretensioner assemblies and, if necessary, replace them. The inspection procedure requires the technician to utilize a pull force gauge to determine whether the subject component is missing the subject rivet and requires replacement. Parts requiring replacement are determined by whether the pretensioner quick connector separates from the pretensioner assembly while the technician is pulling on the seat belt. If no separation occurs, then the part is determined to be not defective and not require replacement.There have been no reports alleging a failure of seat belt pretensioner assemblies after the inspect and replace remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed. Additionally, no comparable failures have been observed in field data for similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall. As of the 4th quarter of 2024, the recall completion rate is at approximately 84% of the total recalled population.In view of the lack of failures after the remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed, and the lack of failures in similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ).

On April 1, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24010 to investigate instances of failure to open the door in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. Some complaints allege the inability to open the door from either the interior or exterior door handle, resulting in the need to use another door to egress.The investigation revealed that all four exterior door handles are subject to sticking in the extended/unlocked position, which may result in the inability to unlatch the door from either the interior or exterior door handle. The root cause is a dimensional interference between the exterior door handle chassis pocket and door handle, causing friction during handle deployment and retraction.

"Unintended Transmission Downshift

In September 2016, Ford Motor Company (Ford) issued safety recall 16V-248 which included certain model year (MY) 2011-2012 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions. This recall was in response to allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, increasing the risk of a crash and/or injury, and included approximately 153,581 vehicles. Ford identified the root cause of the unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear to be intermittent signal loss from the transmission’s Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor due to solder joint cracks on the OSS circuit board as a result of manufacturing process issues. The OSS sensor is mounted onto the molded lead frame and transmits changes in transmission shaft speed to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). The remedy program described in safety recall 16V-248 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring.In December 2017, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ17-010) to assess the scope and remedy effectiveness of safety recall 16V-248. As a result of this ODI investigation, Ford issued safety recall 19V-075 to expand the scope of 16V-248 to include MY 2011-2013 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions and included approximately 1,263,051 vehicles. The remedy program described in safety recall 19V-075 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring. In June 2019, Ford issued safety recall 19V-433 as the remedy program used to service MY 2013 Ford F-150 5.0L and 6.2L vehicles in accordance with safety recall 19V-075 did not contain the necessary updates to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 107,857 vehicles.On March 27, 2024, ODI opened this Recall Query (RQ24-005) to investigate the scope of the above-described safety recalls. At the time that this investigation was opened, ODI had received 86 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) reporting allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, in MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles. As a result of this Recall Query, Ford filled safety recall 24V-444 on June 14, 2024, to include MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles and expand the scope of safety recalls 16V-248, 19V-075 and 19V-433. The remedy program described in safety recall 24V-444 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 552,188 vehicles.In its May 2024 response to ODI’s information request, Ford concluded that a predominant root cause for the intermittent OSS signal loss has not been identified outside of the original safety recall (16V-248). Ford’s investigation also concluded that the primary causes of the defect in MY 2014 F-150 vehicles were related to the molded lead frame and the control assembly transmission main. In the May 2024 response, Ford identified 2,184 total reports that described unintended vehicle transmission downshifting and rear wheel lock-up events; 1,441 warranty claims and 743 reports from consumer complaints, field reports, consumer surveys, and lawsuits/legal claims. Note that the values presented here and in the table above represent the total number of reports which can include a single consumer with multiple reports of the same event as well as a consumer with reports of multiple distinct events. Of the 1,441 warranty claims, 551 warranty claims involved repair of the molded lead frame (38%) and 509 warranty claims involved repair of the control assembly transmission main (35%).Ford has also stated that the PCM programming used to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting was implemented starting with MY 2015 vehicle #1 production and onward.In view of the safety recall action being taken by Ford, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ24-005). The agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Fuel Leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a complaint alleging a compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel leak from a Luxfer Type 4 CNG 60 diesel gallon equivalent (DGE) 26x108 size fuel container.  The container was used in a system built and installed by Natural Gas Fuel Systems, LLC, dba Cummins Clean Fuel Technologies (CCFT).  A strong odor alerted the driver of the fuel leak, which occurred at a fracture at the fuel container's threaded aluminum alloy fixed end boss.The fuel container is positioned longitudinally within an enclosure structure that is attached to the truck's passenger side frame rail in a side-mount configuration. The fuel container is held in position relative to the enclosure structure via neck mounting blocks and two aluminum alloy end bosses, each at opposite ends of the fuel container. The threaded fixed end boss is securely held in position, while the other floating end boss has some degree of freedom to allow for normal expansion and contraction with internal pressure and temperature changes. The complainant reports they are aware of five other trucks purchased by other customers from the same dealership that have experienced the same alleged condition. Furthermore, previous discussions with CCFT have revealed that they are also aware of other similar incidents.A fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source may result in a fire or explosion. To better understand the frequency, severity and scope of the alleged  condition, a Preliminary Evaluation (PE) is being opened.

"No Restart After Auto Start/Stop Engages

On June 3, 2022, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened Preliminary Evaluation PE22005 after the agency received VOQs and several ﬁeld reports concerning the Auto Idle Stop (AIS) feature on 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles. The complaints allege that the engine fails to restart on its own from a complete stop at a traﬃc light or road intersection with the AIS function engaged. The subject vehicles are equipped with a 3.5L engine with a 9-speed automatic transmission.On January 6, 2023, Honda released service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009. These service bulletins address the failure to restart issue in the 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles, as well as the 2015-2020 Acura TLX, 2016-2020 Acura MDX, 2019-2022 Honda Passport, and 2020-2023 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.The repair outlined in the service bulletins is a two-stage countermeasure to remedy the issue. The first stage is a Programmed Fuel Injection (“PGM-FI”) software update. The second stage is only deployed if the software update fails to remedy the issue. The second stage, depending on the model and model year, consists of replacement of the starter assembly, starter relays, and a valve adjustment. Additionally, Honda extended the warranty coverage to 10 years with unlimited mileage for vehicles requiring the second stage component replacement.ODI continues to receive complaints of the AIS failure to restart, with many complainants alleging the campaign countermeasures had been completed.  NHTSA has reviewed Honda's Information Request Letter responses involving warranty claims, lawsuits, and consumer complaints in addition to ODI's own data.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further consider the potential safety defect, including gathering additional data regarding Honda’s service campaign efficacy. ODI is additionally expanding the scope to encompass all vehicles addressed in Honda’s service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009 as well as newer model year vehicles, which are substantially similar to the vehicles covered by the service campaign.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the rear view camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Engineering Analysis (EA) is being opened to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"Crash incidents during Actually Smart Summon sessions

Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon are features on certain Tesla vehicles that allow a user to remotely move the vehicle to the user or to another designated location, through use of a phone app. The Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 1 complaint (VOQ) alleging that an Actually Smart Summon session resulted in a crash and has reviewed at least 3 media reports of apparently similar crashes. All four incidents involve the subject Tesla vehicles operating in Actually Smart Summon failing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash. Actually Smart Summon replaced Smart Summon and provided users with extended vehicle operating range while expanding vehicle connectivity through phone app live camera feeds and increased user latency experience. ODI has received 12 Smart Summon related VOQs alleging crash typology similar to the crashes experienced by users of Actually Smart Summon during sessions with little time for operators to react. ODI is aware of multiple crash allegations, involving both Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon, where the user had too little reaction time to avoid a crash, either with the available line of sight or releasing the phone app button, which stops the vehicle’s movement. Tesla has not reported any Smart Summon or Actually Smart Summon crashes through the Standing General Order for crashes involving ADS or Level 2 ADAS, which requires reporting of crashes on publicly accessible roads. ODI is opening this preliminary evaluation to investigate Actually Smart Summon’s capabilities as they relate to the subject and similar crashes, including the system's operation and ﬁeld performance in FSD equipped vehicles and vehicles included in free trial offers. NHTSA will evaluate the top speed that a vehicle can attain while Actually Smart Summon is engaged, designed-in operating restrictions for usage on public roads, and line of sight requirements. NHTSA expects this preliminary evaluation to include review of remote vehicle control through the phone app at various distances and lines of sight, including app connectivity delays resulting in increased stopping distance and the ability to utilize Actually Smart Summon in roadway environments or operating conditions for which the current version of the system is neither intended nor designed.  To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identiﬁcation Number document, go to NHTSA.gov. nan

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has identified four Standing General Order (SGO) reports in which a Tesla vehicle experienced a crash after entering an area of reduced roadway visibility conditions with FSD -Beta or FSD -Supervised (collectively, FSD) engaged. In these crashes, the reduced roadway visibility arose from conditions such as sun glare, fog, or airborne dust. In one of the crashes, the Tesla vehicle fatally struck a pedestrian. One additional crash in these conditions involved a reported injury. The four SGO crash reports are listed at the end of this summary by SGO number.ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation of FSD (a system labeled by Tesla as a partial driving automation system),which is optionally available in the Model Year (MY) 2016-2024 Models S and X, 2017-2024 Model 3, 2020-2024 Model Y, and 2023-2024 Cybertruck. This Preliminary Evaluation is opened to assess: -	The ability of FSD’s engineering controls to detect and respond appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions; -	Whether any other similar FSD crashes have occurred in reduced roadway visibility conditions and, if so, the contributing circumstances for those crashes; and -	Any updates or modifications from Tesla to the FSD system that may affect the performance of FSD in reduced roadway visibility conditions. In particular, this review will assess the timing, purpose, and capabilities of any such updates, as well as Tesla’s assessment of their safety impact.SGO Report numbers: 13781-8004, 13781-7181, 13781-7381, 13781-7767.

"Frame Flex on Grand Design Fifth Wheel Recreational Trailers

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received twenty-three complaints alleging excessive frame flex on model year 2017-2023 Grand Design fifth wheel recreational trailers, models Momentum and Solitude. Twenty-two of the complaints allege that excessive frame flex resulted in a cargo or entry door opening while in transit, some with objects lost on roadways, while six complaints also state that slideouts extended out partially.  ODI has been in contact with both Grand Design and Lippert, the frame manufacturer. Grand Design believes that some frame flex, generally considered to be vertical movement in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel, is normal. However, Grand Design has developed a technical service bulletin (TSB), to evaluate concerns of excessive frame flex, defined as vertical movement greater than 3/8 inch. Per Grand Design, the frame flex is only occurring in the upper deck area of the fifth wheel and is resulting in cosmetic defects such as moving sidewalls, damage to cabinets, binding doors, etc. However, Lippert believes that the effects of frame flex may also extend back to the front axle of the trailer.  While Lippert provides frames for multiple trailer manufacturers, the majority of complaints are for these Grand Design products.Cargo and entry doors that open and slideouts that extend while in transit increase the risk of injury or a crash. ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to determine whether an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety exists.To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan

"Semi-Trailer Side Underride Guards

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received a petition from Eric Hein, Director of the Institute for Safer Trucking dated July 3, 2024, requesting an investigation of all van-type (also known as box) semi-trailers due to collisions with passenger vehicles and other vulnerable road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists) resulting in significant injuries or death due to the lack of side underride guards (SUGs). On August 26, 2024, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP24004 to evaluate the petitioner’s request. No trailer manufacturer or equipment supplier was identified as the specific subject of the petition. The petition itself can be reviewed at NHTSA.gov under ODI Number 11599188.Currently, a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) requiring side underride guards on semi-trailers does not exist. The petitioner contends that a failure to include side underride guards equates to a safety defect in the semi-trailer’s design, construction and performance. ODI was petitioned in 2021 for this same issue and, after evaluation, denied the request (DP21004). The petitioner here states that evidence of SUG effectiveness to prevent fatalities and mitigate serious injuries “has continued to accumulate” since the denial of DP21004. The petitioner also alleges that “[d]espite a high severity of risk resulting in frequent severe or fatal injuries from side underride crashes, NHTSA has taken no action to investigate recalling semi-trailers without SUGs.”Pursuant to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), NHTSA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that summarized and requested comment on a 2022 NHTSA report with an analysis of potential effects of a requirement for side underride guards on new trailers and semitrailers. 88 Fed. Reg. 24536 (Apr. 21, 2023). NHTSA’s Office of Rulemaking is currently reviewing over 2,000 comments received. Also pursuant to the IIJA, on June 18, 2024, the NHTSA-facilitated Advisory Committee on Underride Protection (ACUP) issued its biennial report to Congress and the Secretary of Transportation. This biennial report consists of a majority report and a minority report summarizing its work to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on safety regulations related to underride crashes that have caused severe injury and death. Though the committee’s charter was extended through June 2025, the committee concluded its work following the publication of the biennial report in June 2024.In addition, NHTSA previously announced several actions related to truck trailer underride safety, including improving data collection of underride crashes by recommending inclusion of underride data in state crash data systems and by providing educational materials to state and local police departments on identifying and recording underride crashes. ODI also actively participates in the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) events where it has encouraged law enforcement to report underride crashes, and proposed CVSA focus on underride guards during the 2024 Operation Road Check, a nationwide 72-hour safety blitz. NHTSA is, further, conducting research on rear impact guard designs that better protect occupants of passenger vehicles in even more rear underride crash scenarios. And NHTSA, with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, published a pamphlet in August 2022—which was distributed to law enforcement through various channels—that explains how to identify and record such crashes (this pamphlet is available at https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/les/2022-08/Underride-Crash- Pamphlet_071522_v6atag.pdf).ODI searched its databases and found no injury or fatality trend specific to any make, model, or model year trailer within Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) and Early Warning Reporting (EWR) data and found one EWR report of vulnerable road user injury or fatalities. ODI also met, separately, with Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. (UTM) and Auto Haulers Association of America regarding UTM’s SUG and to better understand the operational environment of low clearance vehicles, respectively. Based on the information available to the agency, trailer manufacturers continue to pursue side underride guard technology, and at least one manufacturer is currently offering an optional guard.The petitioner submitted two documents to ODI on September 11, 2024. The first was a letter from UTM to Marianne Karth (Petitioner of DP21004 & DP22004) which recounted UTM’s testing of SUGs. The second document was an information sheet generated by the petitioner contesting UTM’s claims. The petitioner also submitted certain documents to ODI on October 1, 2024, which the petitioner had previously submitted separately as part of comments on a collection of information pertaining to Reporting and Documents About Potential Defects (Docket No. NHTSA-2024-0055). This included 45 files regarding 49 unique crashes. ODI reviewed that information and found that of the 49 crashes, twenty-nine (29) potentially involved a subject vehicle. The majority of the 45 files were from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a NHTSA-maintained database of state crash data comprised of certain, albeit often relatively limited information. Notably, of the 29 files, only 2 included the make, model, and model year of the subject vehicle.After consideration of the petition, including the reports and documents provided by the petitioner, NHTSA believes the issues raised here are best addressed through its recent rulemaking and the ongoing actions under IIJA. Accordingly, NHTSA has decided not to open a defect investigation, and the petition is denied. The denial of this petition does not foreclose the agency from taking further action if warranted or making a future finding that a safety-related defect exists based upon additional information the agency may receive.nan

"Engine Stall With Intermittent Restart

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 80 consumer complaints alleging an engine stall and loss of motive power on model year (MY) 2022 RAM 1500 pickup trucks and 2022 Jeep Wagoneer SUV vehicles. The particular engines in the subject vehicles are equipped with the Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group LLC (FCA) 5.7L Hemi eTorque system. The eTorque system is a mild hybrid system that lets the vehicle partially power itself. It accomplishes this by converting the captured energy from the braking system into electricity for the battery pack, which is then used to power a variety of electrical components. ETorque engines replace the alternator with a 48-volt battery-powered belt drive and a motor generator. The motor generator provides extra torque to the crankshaft during gear changes. Simultaneously, the motor generator uses the 48-volt battery pack to increase torque. Many of the complaints state that the vehicle's engine would shut off, often while travelling at slow speed, the vehicle would shift into park and apply the emergency brake. The vehicles were sometimes able to be restarted. In addition, complaints state that the malfunction warning light with the battery fault symbol appeared on the dash.  Many complaints state that a low voltage condition fault is present, sometimes not being able to restart the vehicle. On April 13, 2023, FCA announced recall 23V-265 describing a defect in certain 2021 Ram 1500 vehicles equipped with 5.7L eTorque engines.  The recall described a defect in the powertrain control module software can cause an incorrect fuel mixture condition in the engine, and result in an engine stall. In February of 2024, ODI provided the complaints on the 2022 Ram 1500 and Wagoneer vehicles to FCA. After reviewing the complaints, FCA stated that “the loss of motive power was likely not caused by an over rich fuel condition (as outlined in recall 23V-265), but rather some other cause (e.g., an electrical concern that causes the engine to shut down).”   A Preliminary Evaluation has been opened to assess the scope, frequency, root cause(s) and consequences of these loss/stall of motive power incidents.  Additionally, ODI may expand the scope of the subject population during the investigation, if needed.

"Rear-View Camera Failure

On June 26, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was ﬁled on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda’s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.RQ24011 is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25003) to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the Rear View Camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.

"Inadvertent Door Opening

On May 16, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened Recall Query (RQ) RQ24010 to investigate the remedy and scope of recalls 23V-213 and 23V-312. The affected vehicles by these recalls included model years (MY) 2021 through 2023 Volkswagen ID.4 vehicles. ODI received reports of the vehicle’s doors opening while the vehicle was in motion post recall remedy.  ODI, also, received similar allegations on vehicles that were outside the scope of the recalls.Volkswagen issued recall 23V-213 on March 29, 2023, and recall 23V-213 on May 03, 2023. These recalls addressed the defect of water ingress into the circuit board assembly of the door handle. Water ingress can cause communication issues between the door handle and the door control until. This malfunction resulted in the vehicle door inadvertently opening while the vehicle was in motion.Over the course of the investigation, ODI received 17 unique VIN VOQ complaints of the vehicle doors opening while the vehicle was in motion occurring either post recall remedy or on a vehicle that was outside the recall scope. Volkswagen submitted 190 unique VIN complaints reporting the same circumstances.   On September 4, 2024, Volkswagen submitted recall 24V-651 to address the issue of inadvertent opening of the door while the vehicle is in motion. The scope of this recall expands the affected vehicles to include all MY2021-2024 Volkswagen ID.4 models, including those remedied under the subject recalls. The recall remedy consists of replacement of the door handle assembly on all four doors as well as a software update.  The software update is performed to update the door handle parameters. The new door handle will have the membrane relocated to the back of the handle to avoid standing water within the handle.  Also, a protective coating will be on the front and back of the circuit board to avoid direct moisture formation.  In view of the action being taken by Volkswagen, Recall 24V-651, ODI is closing this Recall Query.  The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.To review the ODI reports cited in the Closing Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan

"Unexpected ADS behavior

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received reports of 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles equipped with Waymo’s 5th generation automated driving system (ADS) wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle was the sole vehicle operated during a collision or wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle exhibited driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws. Reports include collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains, collisions with parked vehicles, and instances in which the ADS appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices. In certain incidents, a collision occurred shortly after the ADS exhibited unexpected behavior near traffic safety control devices. Waymo submitted incident reports involving collisions to NHTSA under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO). Other incidents, such as vehicles driving in opposing lanes with nearby oncoming traffic or entering construction zones, were identified based on publicly available reports.Based on initial evaluation of these incidents, NHTSA understands that the Waymo ADS was either engaged throughout the incident or, in certain cases when supervised by an in-vehicle test driver, the ADS disengaged in the moments just before an incident occurred.ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation to investigate the Waymo 5th Generation ADS’s performance in the incidents identified in this resume and similar scenarios, as well as to more closely assess any commonalities in these incidents. The investigation will evaluate the ADS’s performance in detecting and responding to traffic control devices and in avoiding collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects and vehicles.    The SGO reports cited in the Opening Resume can be found by report identifiers listed below on NHTSA's SGO website: https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting#dataSGO 2021-01 report IDs:30270-116030270-122030270-149430270-436330270-508130270-531830270-575830270-613330270-654830270-656130270-683830270-698130270-704830270-705430270-705830270-730830270-731230270-7534nan

"Rear-end Collisions Involving Zoox Vehicles

On May 10, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24015) to assess reports of sudden unexpected braking in Zoox vehicles, leading to rear-end collisions, as well as to evaluate the performance of the Zoox Automated Driving System in crosswalks around vulnerable road users and in other similar rear-end collision scenarios. These unexpected braking events can increase the risk of a collision. To assess these risks, ODI collected information from Zoox as part of this investigation. In response to ODI’s Request for Information, Zoox provided information describing hard braking events commanded by the ADS. These hard braking events were identified by certain thresholds, including rate of deceleration. ODI analyzed the hard braking events commanded by the Zoox ADS and determined that Zoox ADS-equipped vehicles contributed to 4 collisions. Each of these collisions involved a vulnerable road user, with three of the incidents resulting in injury. Three of the collisions were reported under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), while the other collision was not reportable under the SGO.On March 13, 2025, Zoox ﬁled a safety recall (NHTSA Recall No. 25E019) stating that in specific circumstances “the Zoox ADS software may have reacted over-cautiously and braked unnecessarily hard” and that “the Zoox ADS software may have incorrectly anticipated a collision and braked unnecessarily hard.” These behaviors could lead to increased risk of a rear-end collision caused by unnecessary hard braking. The Zoox recall report indicated that Zoox's ADS has been remedied through a software update that addresses the described defects. As of November 7, 2024, the updated software was released to all impacted Zoox vehicles.In view of the recall action taken by Zoox and ODI’s analysis of the available data, including data presented by Zoox demonstrating a resolution of these hard braking incidents after the software update, ODI is closing this Preliminary Evaluation.

The Office of Defect Investigations (ODI) has received 27 complaints alleging diesel fuel leaks due to a fracture in the secondary fuel filter housing in model year (MY) 2015-2021 Ford Motor Company (Ford) F-250, 350, 450, and 550 Super Duty vehicles equipped with 6.7L diesel engines. Of these complaints, 12 describe an engine compartment fire. The proximity of the secondary fuel filter to high heat sources creates a potential for autoignition thermal events and fires. ODI has contacted the vehicle manufacturer, Ford, and the filter manufacturer, Allevard Sogefi USA (Sogefi), and learned that the low-pressure fuel system is capable of a maximum operating pressure of 8.5 Bar, while the secondary fuel filter is only tested to seven (7) Bar during the manufacturing process. Additionally, changes starting in 2022 by both Ford and Sogefi align with a lack of similar complaints on MY 2022 and newer vehicles.

"Inadvertent Automatic Emergency Braking

On May 8, 2024, the Oﬃce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24013 to investigate reports of inadvertent activation of the automatic emergency braking (AEB) system in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. (Fisker). The complaints allege the activation of AEB without an apparent roadway obstruction in the vehicle’s forward path, resulting in sudden vehicle deceleration. This sudden deceleration occurs without adequate warning or input from the driver. The braking applications range from momentary, partial application resulting in rapid loss of speed to full application, which brings the vehicle to a complete stop in the travel lane.ODI sent Fisker an Information Request (IR) letter on May 20, 2024. On June 17 and 19, 2024, Fisker and its affiliates filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Fisker provided an incomplete response to the IR on July 1, 2024. Limited information pertaining to system validation and failure data was provided. Fisker subsequently requested more time to provide additional responsive files due to limited available resources. Fisker sent additional responsive files on September 9, 2024, September 17, 2024, and December 16, 2024, but Fisker’s response did not contain sufficient information for ODI to fully evaluate the alleged safety defect.Further, on December 27, 2024, the Fisker employees with whom ODI had been corresponding informed ODI that all Fisker employees were being “dismissed” as of that date. ODI therefore does not anticipate receiving any further responsive submissions such that it can fully evaluate the reports that led to this investigation. ODI performed phone interviews and sent a survey to consumers to obtain more information and validate the allegations. Additionally, ODI reviewed allegations of the alleged safety defect that were submitted to various online forums. Most of these reports were similar in nature to the reports received by ODI. Some of the reports in online forums appear to be duplicative reports that were also submitted to ODI. Based on the responses received and analysis of similar online reporting, there was no clear trend in the following factors pertaining to the allegations: reoccurrence of events (i.e., single or multiple incidents), speed immediately prior to the event, whether the event concluded in a reduction of speed or a full stop, roadway conditions, and warning immediately prior to the event.To date, between the reports provided by Fisker and complaints made directly to the agency, ODI is aware of over 20 reports alleging inadvertent AEB activation. Before the employees were dismissed, Fisker’s testing done in response to the inadvertent AEB allegations reportedly did not result in any inadvertent AEB activations. The “Manufacturer” and “Total” counts in the above table have been left blank because of a pending request for confidential treatment by Fisker that could not be timely addressed given the company’s status. This information factored into ODI’s investigation and analysis.The available information does not warrant further action at this time.  The closing of this investigation does not constitute a finding by NHTSA that a safety-related defect does not exist. Additionally, the Agency notes that the Vehicle Safety Act states: “A manufacturer’s filing of a petition in bankruptcy under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title 11 does not negate the manufacturer’s duty to comply with section 30112 or sections 30115 through 30120 of this title,” which include the recall provisions of the Act. The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.

"Recall 23V838 Remedy Effectiveness

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is opening a Recall Query to assess the remedy adequacy of Recall 23V838. On December 12, 2023, Tesla filed a Defect Information Report (Recall 23V838) applicable to all Tesla models produced and equipped with any version of its Autopilot system, which Tesla described as an SAE Level 2 (L2) Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Autopilot is the simultaneous engagement of Tesla’s Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) and Autosteer. In describing the safety defect, Tesla’s Defect Information Report (DIR) explained that “the prominence and scope of the system’s controls may be insufficient to prevent driver misuse,” and Tesla committed to the deployment of a multipart remedy aimed at improving system and engagement controls and reducing mode confusion.EA22002 (upgraded from PE21020) was opened to investigate whether Tesla’s Autopilot contained a defect that created an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety and involved extensive crash analysis, human factors analysis, vehicle evaluations, and assessment of vehicle control authority and driver engagement technologies. The work conducted in these investigations aligns with Tesla’s conclusion in its 23V838 recall filing. During EA22002, ODI identified at least 13 crashes involving one or more fatalities and many more involving serious injuries in which foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.  Tesla filed Recall 23V838 to address concerns regarding the Autopilot system investigated in EA22002. Following deployment of the remedy in Recall 23V838, ODI identified concerns due to post-remedy crash events and results from preliminary NHTSA tests of remedied vehicles. Also, Tesla has stated that a portion of the remedy both requires the owner to opt in and allows a driver to readily reverse it. Tesla has also deployed non-remedy updates to address issues that appear related to ODI’s concerns under EA22002. This investigation will consider why these updates were not a part of the recall or otherwise determined to remedy a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk. ODI is therefore opening this Recall Query investigation to further evaluate the adequacy of the remedy for recall 23V838.nan

"Collisions Involving Ford BlueCruise

On April 25, 2024, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24012) to assess BlueCruise, a partial driving automation system available on certain vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company (Ford). NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI’s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle’s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford’s response to ODI’s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford’s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles’ event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency’s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA’s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Preliminary Evaluation is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25001) to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers’ ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports. The crashes included in the failure report summary can be found at NHTSA.gov under the following SGO report identification numbers: 502-7268, 502-7426, 502-6852, 502-8738.nan

"Electronic Brake Module Component Failure

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received multiple Early Warning Reporting field reports alleging a loss of brake boost assist in MY2023 Cadillac LYRIQ vehicles. The reports allege a hard brake pedal, followed by a “Brake System Failure” message at start up or while driving. The EWR field reports have been verified by General Motors (GM). GM stated the electronic brake control module, also known as “eBoost”, has an internal spindle that can fracture during an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) event. GM further stated that due to the fracture, the vehicles can lose brake assist, experience speed limitation, and ABS would lose some functionality.GM indicated a new material clean break point was introduced in the assembly plants in May 2023.  GM has also developed an over the air (OTA) update, which will cycle the brake booster similarly to an ABS event at start-up for every key cycle. If the spindle fractures during this start-up cycling, a warning lamp will illuminate to prompt the customer to bring the vehicle to the dealership to be diagnosed and repaired under warranty. This software update was not conducted as a recall.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to determine the scope and severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related issues.nan

"Under hood fires caused by fuel leak

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) reviewed Ford Motor Company’s (Ford’s) proposed remedy for recall 24V-187. ODI evaluated information from Ford concerning the recall remedy for the involved vehicles.Ford issued recall 24V-187 on March 8, 2024, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2022-2023 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022 Ford Escape vehicles equipped with 1.5L engines. Recall 24V-187 states that a fuel injector may crack resulting in liquid fuel and/or fuel vapor migration to, and accumulation near, ignition sources that may cause an under hood fire, fuel odor both outside and inside of the vehicle, and increase the risk of injury. Recall 24V-187 further states that a cracked fuel injector in the engine allows for fuel to leak at a high rate into the cylinder head, which can travel out via a drain hole and down onto hot surfaces on the exhaust and/or turbo system.The recall remedy for 24V-187 involves 1) an engine control software update and 2) installation of a drain tube. The engine control software update will detect a pressure drop in the fuel rail providing a “seek service” message within the vehicle’s instrument cluster, as well as invoke a strategy to disable the high-pressure fuel pump, de-rate engine power output, and reduce temperatures of possible ignition sources in the engine compartment. The drain tube will allow fuel to drain from the cylinder head hole to the ground below the vehicle away from surfaces which may initiate combustion. The recall remedy does not include replacement of the cracked fuel injector.On November 18, 2022, recall 22V-859 was issued involving MY 2020-2023 Ford Escape and MY 2021-2023 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles.

"Front Seat Belt Assemblies may be Missing the Rivet that Secures the Quick Connector and Wire Plate

On April 4, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened RQ24006 to investigate American Honda Motor Co.’s (Honda’s) proposed remedy for recall 23V-782 as well as scope of the vehicles involved.Honda issued recall 23V-782 on November 21, 2023, which concerns certain model year (MY) 2023-2024 Honda Accord, Honda Accord Hybrid, and Honda HR-V vehicles. Recall 23V-782 states that the driver and front passenger seat belt pretensioner assemblies may have been manufactured without a rivet that secures the pretensioner quick connector and wire plate. Recall documentation states that seat belt pretensioner assemblies that are missing the rivet will not properly restrain the occupant in the event of a collision, increasing the risk of injury.  Subject defective seat belt assemblies are installed as original equipment for both the driver and front passenger positions for the HR-V, but only for the driver position for the Accord and Accord Hybrid.The recall remedy for 23V-782 instructs the technician to inspect both front seat belt pretensioner assemblies and, if necessary, replace them. The inspection procedure requires the technician to utilize a pull force gauge to determine whether the subject component is missing the subject rivet and requires replacement. Parts requiring replacement are determined by whether the pretensioner quick connector separates from the pretensioner assembly while the technician is pulling on the seat belt. If no separation occurs, then the part is determined to be not defective and not require replacement.There have been no reports alleging a failure of seat belt pretensioner assemblies after the inspect and replace remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed. Additionally, no comparable failures have been observed in field data for similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall. As of the 4th quarter of 2024, the recall completion rate is at approximately 84% of the total recalled population.In view of the lack of failures after the remedy for recall 23V-782 was performed, and the lack of failures in similar vehicles outside of the scope of the recall, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ).

"Unintended Transmission Downshift

In September 2016, Ford Motor Company (Ford) issued safety recall 16V-248 which included certain model year (MY) 2011-2012 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions. This recall was in response to allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, increasing the risk of a crash and/or injury, and included approximately 153,581 vehicles. Ford identified the root cause of the unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear to be intermittent signal loss from the transmission’s Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor due to solder joint cracks on the OSS circuit board as a result of manufacturing process issues. The OSS sensor is mounted onto the molded lead frame and transmits changes in transmission shaft speed to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). The remedy program described in safety recall 16V-248 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring.In December 2017, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ17-010) to assess the scope and remedy effectiveness of safety recall 16V-248. As a result of this ODI investigation, Ford issued safety recall 19V-075 to expand the scope of 16V-248 to include MY 2011-2013 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions and included approximately 1,263,051 vehicles. The remedy program described in safety recall 19V-075 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring. In June 2019, Ford issued safety recall 19V-433 as the remedy program used to service MY 2013 Ford F-150 5.0L and 6.2L vehicles in accordance with safety recall 19V-075 did not contain the necessary updates to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 107,857 vehicles.On March 27, 2024, ODI opened this Recall Query (RQ24-005) to investigate the scope of the above-described safety recalls. At the time that this investigation was opened, ODI had received 86 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) reporting allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, in MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles. As a result of this Recall Query, Ford filled safety recall 24V-444 on June 14, 2024, to include MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles and expand the scope of safety recalls 16V-248, 19V-075 and 19V-433. The remedy program described in safety recall 24V-444 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 552,188 vehicles.In its May 2024 response to ODI’s information request, Ford concluded that a predominant root cause for the intermittent OSS signal loss has not been identified outside of the original safety recall (16V-248). Ford’s investigation also concluded that the primary causes of the defect in MY 2014 F-150 vehicles were related to the molded lead frame and the control assembly transmission main.
