The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nFSD Collisions in Reduced Roadway Visibility Conditions\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has identified four Standing General Order (SGO) reports in which a Tesla vehicle experienced a crash after entering an area of reduced roadway visibility conditions with FSD -Beta or FSD -Supervised (collectively, FSD) engaged. In these crashes, the reduced roadway visibility arose from conditions such as sun glare, fog, or airborne dust. In one of the crashes, the Tesla vehicle fatally struck a pedestrian. One additional crash in these conditions involved a reported injury. The four SGO crash reports are listed at the end of this summary by SGO number.ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation of FSD (a system labeled by Tesla as a partial driving automation system),which is optionally available in the Model Year (MY) 2016-2024 Models S and X, 2017-2024 Model 3, 2020-2024 Model Y, and 2023-2024 Cybertruck. This Preliminary Evaluation is opened to assess: -\tThe ability of FSD\u2019s engineering controls to detect and respond appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions; -\tWhether any other similar FSD crashes have occurred in reduced roadway visibility conditions and, if so, the contributing circumstances for those crashes; and -\tAny updates or modifications from Tesla to the FSD system that may affect the performance of FSD in reduced roadway visibility conditions. In particular, this review will assess the timing, purpose, and capabilities of any such updates, as well as Tesla\u2019s assessment of their safety impact.SGO Report numbers: 13781-8004, 13781-7181, 13781-7381, 13781-7767.
