The particular engines in the subject vehicles are equipped with the Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group LLC (FCA) 5.7L Hemi eTorque system. The eTorque system is a mild hybrid system that lets the vehicle partially power itself. It accomplishes this by converting the captured energy from the braking system into electricity for the battery pack, which is then used to power a variety of electrical components. ETorque engines replace the alternator with a 48-volt battery-powered belt drive and a motor generator. The motor generator provides extra torque to the crankshaft during gear changes. Simultaneously, the motor generator uses the 48-volt battery pack to increase torque.\u00a0Many of the complaints state that the vehicle's engine would shut off, often while travelling at slow speed, the vehicle would shift into park and apply the emergency brake. The vehicles were sometimes able to be restarted. In addition, complaints state that the malfunction warning light with the battery fault symbol appeared on the dash.\u00a0 Many complaints state that a low voltage condition fault is present, sometimes not being able to restart the vehicle.\u00a0On April 13, 2023, FCA announced recall 23V-265 describing a defect in certain 2021 Ram 1500 vehicles equipped with 5.7L eTorque engines.\u00a0 The recall described a defect in the powertrain control module software can cause an incorrect fuel mixture condition in the engine, and result in an engine stall.\u00a0In February of 2024, ODI provided the complaints on the 2022 Ram 1500 and Wagoneer vehicles to FCA. After reviewing the complaints, FCA stated that \u201cthe loss of motive power was likely not caused by an over rich fuel condition (as outlined in recall 23V-265), but rather some other cause (e.g., an electrical concern that causes the engine to shut down).\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0A Preliminary Evaluation has been opened to assess the scope, frequency, root cause(s) and consequences of these loss/stall of motive power incidents.\u00a0 Additionally, ODI may expand the scope of the subject population during the investigation, if needed.
