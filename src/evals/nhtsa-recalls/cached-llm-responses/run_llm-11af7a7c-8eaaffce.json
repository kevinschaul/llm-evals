The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), or fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nUnderhood fires\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 9 Vehicle Owner's Questionnaire (VOQ) reports, 1 Death and Injury report, and multiple field reports alleging incidents of engine compartment fires in model year (MY) 2021-2023 Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator vehicles. The majority of the reports describe a fire occurring while the ignition in the vehicle was in an \u2018OFF\u2019 state with a suspected origin at the passenger front side of the engine compartment. An ignition \u2018OFF\u2019 vehicle fire can result in an increased risk of occupant injury, injury to persons outside the vehicle, and property damage, with little to no warning.ODI has contacted the vehicle manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), and learned of several thermal events originating at the power steering pump electrical connector in recent model year Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator vehicles. The location of the pump connector is located at the passenger front side of the engine compartment, coinciding with the majority of fire reports known to ODI. ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to assess the cause, scope, and frequency of the alleged defect.
