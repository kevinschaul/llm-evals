The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), or fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nReduced Braking Performance from Software Error\n\nHyundai Motor America (Hyundai) is recalling certain 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 \"N\" vehicles equipped with left-foot braking (LFB) and N e-shift features.  The integrated electronic brake (IEB) and vehicle control unit (VCU) software may cause reduced braking performance when LFB is activated.  Additionally, the vehicle may continue to accelerate after the pedal is released and the vehicle's N e-shift feature is engaged.Reduced braking performance and unexpected, continued acceleration increase the risk of a crash.\n\nNumber of Units Affected: 1589.0"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "{\"result\": true}", "cached_at": "2025-04-25 12:19:26"}
