The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nElectrical arcing and thermal events, potentially leading to fires, while utilizing Enel X Way USA, LLC's JuiceBox residential charger.\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received six complaints (VOQs) alleging failures of Enel X Way's JuiceBox Level 2 residential EV chargers. One individual\u2019s complaint alleges that charging their vehicle with a JuiceBox led to an explosion in their garage that set fire to a home and rendered it a total loss. Another individual alleges that a car caught fire in their driveway while charging with a JuiceBox. Four other complaints describe electrical malfunctions tripping circuit breakers and disrupting electric vehicle charge cycles.\u00a0Additionally, ODI has become aware of a communication sent to charger owners on October 2, 2024 and posted on Enel X Way's website that Enel X Way North America will cease operations in the United States and Canada on October 11, 2024. Ceasing operations could also impact the charging app and supporting software.\u00a0ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation to assess the scope, frequency, and safety consequences of the potential safety-related problem, including the safety impacts related to the app and supporting software.
