The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nCrash incidents during Actually Smart Summon sessions\n\nSmart Summon and Actually Smart Summon are features on certain Tesla vehicles that allow a user to remotely move the vehicle to the user or to another designated location, through use of a phone app. The O\ufb03ce of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 1 complaint (VOQ) alleging that an Actually Smart Summon session resulted in a crash and has reviewed at least 3 media reports\u00a0of apparently similar crashes. All four incidents involve the subject Tesla vehicles operating in Actually Smart Summon failing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u00a0Actually Smart Summon replaced Smart Summon and provided users with extended vehicle operating range while expanding vehicle connectivity through phone app live camera feeds and increased user latency experience. ODI has received 12 Smart Summon related VOQs alleging crash typology similar to the crashes experienced by users of Actually Smart Summon during sessions with little time for operators to react.\u00a0ODI is aware of multiple crash allegations, involving both Smart Summon and Actually Smart Summon, where the user had too little reaction time to avoid a crash, either with the available line of sight or releasing the phone app button, which stops the vehicle\u2019s movement.\u00a0Tesla has not reported any Smart Summon or Actually Smart Summon crashes through the Standing General Order for crashes involving ADS or Level 2 ADAS, which requires reporting of crashes on publicly accessible roads.\u00a0ODI is opening this preliminary evaluation to investigate Actually Smart Summon\u2019s capabilities as they relate to the subject and similar crashes, including the system's operation and \ufb01eld performance in FSD equipped vehicles and vehicles included in free trial offers. NHTSA will evaluate the top speed that a vehicle can attain while Actually Smart Summon is engaged, designed-in operating restrictions for usage on public roads, and line of sight requirements. NHTSA expects this preliminary evaluation to include review of remote vehicle control through the phone app at various distances and lines of sight, including app connectivity delays resulting in increased stopping distance and the ability to utilize Actually Smart Summon in roadway environments or operating conditions for which the current version of the system is neither intended nor designed.\u00a0 To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identi\ufb01cation Number document, go to NHTSA.gov. nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "```json\n{\"result\": true}\n```", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 10:23:16"}
