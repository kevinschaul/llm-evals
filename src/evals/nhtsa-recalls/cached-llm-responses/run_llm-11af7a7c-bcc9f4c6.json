Return `{\"result\": true}` or `{\"result\": false}`\ncontent: Rear-View Camera Failure\n\nOn June 26, 2024, the O\ufb03ce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ24011) to assess the long-term suitability of the remedy for recall 22V-867, which was \ufb01led on November 23, 2022 by American Honda Motor Co. (Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda\u2019s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda\u2019s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure. Honda indicated that it is aware of a total of 14 reports regarding remedy RVC wire harness failures associated with Recall 22V-867. Additional remedy parts may not have yet seen sufficient wear to induce the failure. ODI also believes further testing is necessary to assess the potential failures in these parts.RQ24011 is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25003) to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety related consequences of the Rear View Camera harness failures in 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.
