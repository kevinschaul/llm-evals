The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nVehicle entrapment\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE23-008 on May 1, 2023 to investigate an incident involving a 2009 Dodge Journey alleging occupant entrapment during a vehicle fire that resulted in a fatality. During the investigation, ODI collected information from the manufacturer and involved parties to confirm or refute the defect allegation. ODI has determined that additional reports of vehicle entrapment exist for other model year Dodge Journey vehicles. ODI continues to explore the cause of the thermal event and its potential effect on the actuation of the door locks. ODI also continues to explore other potential causes for door lock malfunction. ODI has determined that an upgrade to an Engineering Analysis (EA) is necessary to continue the review of the investigative material and to assess the risk to motor vehicle safety .\t\t\t\t\tTo review the ODI report cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "```json\n{\"result\": true}\n```", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 10:23:39"}
