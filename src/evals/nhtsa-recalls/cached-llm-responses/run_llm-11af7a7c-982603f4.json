Return `{\"result\": true}` or `{\"result\": false}`\ncontent: Failure to open door\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened PE24010 to investigate instances of failure to open the door in model year (MY) 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles manufactured by Fisker Group Inc. Some complaints allege the inability to open the door from either the interior or exterior door handle, resulting in the need to use another door to egress.The investigation revealed that all four exterior door handles are subject to sticking in the extended/unlocked position, which may result in the inability to unlatch the door from either the interior or exterior door handle. The root cause is a dimensional interference between the exterior door handle chassis pocket and door handle, causing friction during handle deployment and retraction. The inability to open and egress from the occupant\u2019s adjacent door presents an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety.On June 27, 2024, Fisker filed recall 24V-466 for certain MY 2023 Fisker Ocean vehicles. The recall remedy includes an inspection procedure for all four doors and provides replacement of the outer door handle if a \u201cNot Okay\u201d result is found.In view of the recall action being taken by Fisker, ODI is closing this Preliminary Evaluation. The agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.
