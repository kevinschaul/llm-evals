The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nRear-end Collisions Involving Zoox Vehicles\n\nOn May 10, 2024, the O\ufb03ce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24015) to assess reports of sudden unexpected braking in Zoox vehicles, leading to rear-end collisions, as well as to evaluate the performance of the Zoox Automated Driving System in crosswalks around vulnerable road users and in other similar rear-end collision scenarios. These unexpected braking events can increase the risk of a collision. To assess these risks, ODI collected information from Zoox as part of this investigation. In response to ODI\u2019s Request for Information, Zoox provided information describing hard braking events commanded by the ADS. These hard braking events were identified by certain thresholds, including rate of deceleration. ODI analyzed the hard braking events commanded by the Zoox ADS and determined that Zoox ADS-equipped vehicles contributed to 4 collisions. Each of these collisions involved a vulnerable road user, with three of the incidents resulting in injury. Three of the collisions were reported under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), while the other collision was not reportable under the SGO.On March 13, 2025, Zoox \ufb01led a safety recall (NHTSA Recall No. 25E019) stating that in specific circumstances \u201cthe Zoox ADS software may have reacted over-cautiously and braked unnecessarily hard\u201d and that \u201cthe Zoox ADS software may have incorrectly anticipated a collision and braked unnecessarily hard.\u201d These behaviors could lead to increased risk of a rear-end collision caused by unnecessary hard braking. The Zoox recall report indicated that Zoox's ADS has been remedied through a software update that addresses the described defects. As of November 7, 2024, the updated software was released to all impacted Zoox vehicles.In view of the recall action taken by Zoox and ODI\u2019s analysis of the available data, including data presented by Zoox demonstrating a resolution of these hard braking incidents after the software update, ODI is closing this Preliminary Evaluation. NHTSA reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by new circumstances.To review the SGO reports cited above, go to NHTSA.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting.\u00a0 The SGO report ID numbers are provided below:30610-7578\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 30610-7589\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 30610-4810 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "```json\n{\"result\": true}\n```", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 10:23:47"}
