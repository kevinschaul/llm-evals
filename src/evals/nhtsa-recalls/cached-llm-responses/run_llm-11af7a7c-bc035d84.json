Return `{\"result\": true}` or `{\"result\": false}`\ncontent: Trailer Hitch Receiver Structure may Crack and Separate\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 5 complaints for various 2016-2022 Thor Motor Coach motorhomes alleging that the trailer hitch receiver (\"hitch\") or recreational vehicle (RV) frame cracked and/or separated, including one which resulted in the towed item detaching and causing property damage. Other examples of hitch or frame cracking have been discovered prior to hitch separation.ODI has contacted the RV manufacturer, Thor, the frame extension manufacturer, Mor-Ryde, and the hitch manufacturer, Lippert, who, in response, allege that consumers are overloading the hitch. While the amount that a motorhome can tow must be calculated after determining the cargo, passenger and liquids weights, the hitch that failed had an 8,000lb limit and the vehicle it was flat-towing weighed approximately 4,000lbs.Hitch or frame cracking resulting in the towed item detaching and becoming loose on the roadway increases the risk of a crash to others on the roadway.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to determine whether an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety exists.
