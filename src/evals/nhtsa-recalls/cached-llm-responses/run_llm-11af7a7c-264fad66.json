Return `{\"result\": true}` or `{\"result\": false}`\ncontent: Loss of Motive Power\n\nIn January 2024, The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE24002) to investigate allegations of loss of motive power in model year (MY) 2021 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles. In April 2024, Ford issued safety recall 24V-267 covering 456,565 MY 2021-2024 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022-2023 Ford Maverick vehicles. The recall addressed occurrences of loss of motive power resulting from sudden degradation of the 12V battery during the drive cycle. When the battery failure occurs, consumers may experience a complete loss of engine power without the ability to restart, accompanied by the loss of 12V accessories, including hazard lights. The recall remedy consists of software updates to the body control module and powertrain control module, which were designed to provide improved detection of the 12V battery state of charge during the drive cycle and provide warning to consumers if the battery is degraded.ODI has since received 15 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) describing loss of motive power incidents for MY 2021 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles that received the 24V-267 recall remedy. Consumers describe that prior to the loss of motive power, there were no warnings related to the 12V battery or vehicle electrical system. Additionally, multiple consumers reported that after the vehicle was towed to the dealership following the loss of motive power, the event was diagnosed to the 12V battery, and a battery replacement was the only required repair.ODI is opening this Recall Query on MY 2021-2024 Ford Bronco Sport and MY 2022-2023 Ford Maverick vehicles to assess the effectiveness of the 24V-267 recall remedy.
