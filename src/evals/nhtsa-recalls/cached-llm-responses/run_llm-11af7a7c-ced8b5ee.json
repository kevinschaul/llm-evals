The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nLoss of Motive Power\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has identified 68 Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) reports for model years (MY) 2021 through 2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe vehicles alleging a loss of motive power. Recall 22V-865 was issued by the manufacturer to address an engine shutdown condition in certain MY 2021-2023 Wrangler 4xe vehicles. The complaints noted here contain both post recall remedy failures and failures in vehicles not included within the scope of 22V-865. An analysis comparing complaints received before the issuance of recall 22V-865 and complaints outside the scope of the recall has been conducted. The results show the current complaint rate is higher in the out of scope vehicles than it was for vehicles that were later covered by the recall.ODI is opening this Recall Query (RQ) to assess the severity of the alleged defect in vehicles not included in recall 22V-865.  ODI will also assess the scope and remedy effectiveness of the recall.
