{"args": ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "You are a helpful newspaper reporter who is very knowledgeable about US motor vehicle regulation and the NHTSA recall process, as well as the sorts of things that the Washington Post writes about.\n\nRead the provided NHTSA investigation summary and return a JSON response of `{\"result\": true}` if the recall is newsworthy to the Washington Post or  `{\"result\": false}` if it is not.\n\nAs a reminder, the Washington Post is very interested in automated vehicles, automation and advanced driver assistance systems, electric vehicles and Teslas, as well as any defect that lead to multiple deaths or serious injuries. The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), or fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nUnexpected ADS behavior\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received reports of 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles equipped with Waymo\u2019s 5th generation automated driving system (ADS) wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle was the sole vehicle operated during a collision or wherein the ADS-equipped vehicle exhibited driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws. Reports include collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains, collisions with parked vehicles, and instances in which the ADS appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices. In certain incidents, a collision occurred shortly after the ADS exhibited unexpected behavior near traffic safety control devices. Waymo submitted incident reports involving collisions to NHTSA under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO). Other incidents, such as vehicles driving in opposing lanes with nearby oncoming traffic or entering construction zones, were identified based on publicly available reports.Based on initial evaluation of these incidents, NHTSA understands that the Waymo ADS was either engaged throughout the incident or, in certain cases when supervised by an in-vehicle test driver, the ADS disengaged in the moments just before an incident occurred.ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation to investigate the Waymo 5th Generation ADS\u2019s performance in the incidents identified in this resume and similar scenarios, as well as to more closely assess any commonalities in these incidents. The investigation will evaluate the ADS\u2019s performance in detecting and responding to traffic control devices and in avoiding collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects and vehicles. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The SGO reports cited in the Opening Resume can be found by report identifiers listed below on NHTSA's SGO website: https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting#dataSGO 2021-01 report IDs:30270-116030270-122030270-149430270-436330270-508130270-531830270-575830270-613330270-654830270-656130270-683830270-698130270-704830270-705430270-705830270-730830270-731230270-7534nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "```json\n{\"result\": true}\n```", "cached_at": "2025-04-25 12:18:40"}
