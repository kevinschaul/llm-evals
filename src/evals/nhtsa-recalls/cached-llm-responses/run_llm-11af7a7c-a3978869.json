The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), or fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nInner Tie Rod Failures\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received one Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) and Early Warning Reporting (EWR) field report data on 2021 Nissan Rogue vehicles with allegations of inner tie rod failures resulting in a loss of steering control. The failures have been reported to occur on either driver or passenger side of the vehicle. In some cases, the vehicle required towing from the failure location for repair service. ODI is opening this investigation to further assess the scope, frequency, root cause, and potential safety-related consequences of the alleged defect leading to loss of steering control on 2021 Nissan Rogue.The ODI report cited above can be reviewed at https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=11554914.nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "```json\n{\"result\": false}\n```", "cached_at": "2025-04-25 12:18:31"}
