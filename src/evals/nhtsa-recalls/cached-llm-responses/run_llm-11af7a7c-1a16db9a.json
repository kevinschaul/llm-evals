The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nUnintended Transmission Downshift and Rear Wheel Lock-up\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 138 consumer complaints for model years 2015-2017 Ford F-150 vehicles alleging an unexpected, unrequested transmission downshift to a lower gear while traveling at highway speeds without any prior warning or driver input. This unrequested transmission downshift would cause unexpected rapid vehicle deceleration. Certain consumer complaints additionally allege that the vehicle's rear wheels temporarily lock, seize, and/or skid during the downshift resulting in a loss of vehicle control increasing the risk for crash and injury. ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to determine the scope and severity of the potential safety-related consequences.To review the reports cited in the attached Opening Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "```json\n{\"result\": true}\n```", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 10:23:11"}
