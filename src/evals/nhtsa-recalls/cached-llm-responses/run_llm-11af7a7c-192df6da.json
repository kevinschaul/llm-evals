The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nInadvertent Door Opening\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) opened Recall Query (RQ) RQ24010 to investigate the remedy and scope of recalls 23V-213 and 23V-312. The affected vehicles by these recalls included model years (MY) 2021 through 2023 Volkswagen ID.4 vehicles. ODI received reports of the vehicle\u2019s doors opening while the vehicle was in motion post recall remedy.\u00a0 ODI, also, received similar allegations on vehicles that were outside the scope of the recalls.Volkswagen issued recall 23V-213 on March 29, 2023, and recall 23V-213 on May 03, 2023. These recalls addressed the defect of water ingress into the circuit board assembly of the door handle. Water ingress can cause communication issues between the door handle and the door control until. This malfunction resulted in the vehicle door inadvertently opening while the vehicle was in motion.Over the course of the investigation, ODI received 17 unique VIN VOQ complaints of the vehicle doors opening while the vehicle was in motion occurring either post recall remedy or on a vehicle that was outside the recall scope. Volkswagen submitted 190 unique VIN complaints reporting the same circumstances. \u00a0\u00a0On September 4, 2024, Volkswagen submitted recall 24V-651 to address the issue of inadvertent opening of the door while the vehicle is in motion. The scope of this recall expands the affected vehicles to include all MY2021-2024 Volkswagen ID.4 models, including those remedied under the subject recalls. The recall remedy consists of replacement of the door handle assembly on all four doors as well as a software update.\u00a0 The software update is performed to update the door handle parameters. The new door handle will have the membrane relocated to the back of the handle to avoid standing water within the handle.\u00a0 Also, a protective coating will be on the front and back of the circuit board to avoid direct moisture formation. \u00a0In view of the action being taken by Volkswagen, Recall 24V-651, ODI is closing this Recall Query.\u00a0 The Agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.To review the ODI reports cited in the Closing Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "```json\n{\"result\": true}\n```", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 10:21:22"}
