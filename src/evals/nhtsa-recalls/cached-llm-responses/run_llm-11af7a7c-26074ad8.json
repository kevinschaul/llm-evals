The fuel container is held in position relative to the enclosure structure via neck mounting blocks and two aluminum alloy end bosses, each at opposite ends of the fuel container. The threaded fixed end boss is securely held in position, while the other floating end boss has some degree of freedom to allow for normal expansion and contraction with internal pressure and temperature changes. The complainant reports they are aware of five other trucks purchased by other customers from the same dealership that have experienced the same alleged condition. Furthermore, previous discussions with CCFT have revealed that they are also aware of other similar incidents.A fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source may result in a fire or explosion. To better understand the frequency, severity and scope of the alleged  condition, a Preliminary Evaluation (PE) is being opened.
