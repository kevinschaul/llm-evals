The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), or fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nLoss of motive power due to engine failure\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 39 complaints and a number of Early Warning Reporting (EWR) Field Reports alleging engine failure in vehicles manufactured by General Motors (GM) equipped with the L87 V8 engine. This includes 2019-2024 Model Year (MY) Chevrolet Silverado 1500, 2019-2024MY GMC Sierra 1500, 2021-2024MY Chevrolet Tahoe, 2021-2024MY Chevrolet Suburban, 2021-2024MY GMC Yukon and 2021-2024MY Cadillac Escalade vehicles. The complainants report a bearing failure that may result in either engine seizure or breaching of the engine block by the connecting rod. The complainants report that there is no detectability prior to the failure.Failure or malfunction of the engine results in loss of motive power of the vehicle, which may lead to an increased risk of a crash resulting in injury and/or property damage.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to determine the scope and severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related issues.
