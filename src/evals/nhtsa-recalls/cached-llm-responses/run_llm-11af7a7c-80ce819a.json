Recall 22V-865 was issued by the manufacturer to address an engine shutdown condition in certain MY 2021-2023 Wrangler 4xe vehicles. The complaints noted here contain both post recall remedy failures and failures in vehicles not included within the scope of 22V-865. An analysis comparing complaints received before the issuance of recall 22V-865 and complaints outside the scope of the recall has been conducted. The results show the current complaint rate is higher in the out of scope vehicles than it was for vehicles that were later covered by the recall.ODI is opening this Recall Query (RQ) to assess the severity of the alleged defect in vehicles not included in recall 22V-865.
