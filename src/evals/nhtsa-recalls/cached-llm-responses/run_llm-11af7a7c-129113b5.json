The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nInadvertent Automatic Emergency Braking\n\nOn September 28, 2023, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Preliminary Evaluation (PE23017) to assess reports of inadvertent activation of the Front Assist automatic emergency braking (AEB) system in model year (MY) 2018-2019 Volkswagen Atlas vehicles.\u00a0 The reports alleged that activation of the AEB system occurred while driving with no apparent obstruction in the vehicle's forward path, resulting in sudden vehicle deceleration.Volkswagen indicated that it is aware of a total of 226 reports that may relate to the alleged defect in MY 2019 Volkswagen Atlas vehicles.  Volkswagen stated that some customers possibly had an inadequate understanding of Front Assist and its limitations. \u00a0However, many consumer complaints alleged that Volkswagen dealerships were unable to reproduce the condition or stated that Volkswagen dealerships informed the consumers that this braking is considered normal Front Assist operation.ODI's analysis shows that MY 2019 Volkswagen Atlas vehicles have the highest rate of unique incident reports alleging AEB inadvertent activation when compared to their Volkswagen peers.To date, ODI has received a total of 44 consumer complaints of inadvertent activation of Front Assist in MY 2019 Volkswagen Atlas vehicles.  In total, ODI reviewed 187 unique (i.e., non-duplicative Vehicle Identification Numbers) reports that may relate to the alleged defect, which include four reports on injury incidents and one report involving a crash.PE23017 has been upgraded to an Engineering Analysis to further assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety-related consequences of inadvertent AEB activations in MY 2019 Volkswagen Atlas vehicles.To review the ODI reports cited in the Opening Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "```json\n{\"result\": true}\n```", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 10:21:00"}
