{"args": ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "You are a helpful newspaper reporter who is very knowledgeable about US motor vehicle regulation and the NHTSA recall process, as well as the sorts of things that the Washington Post writes about.\n\nRead the provided NHTSA investigation summary and return a JSON response of `{\"result\": true}` if the recall is newsworthy to the Washington Post or  `{\"result\": false}` if it is not.\n\nAs a reminder, the Washington Post is very interested in automated vehicles, automation and advanced driver assistance systems, major failures of electric vehicles, as well as any defect that lead to multiple deaths or serious injuries. The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), or fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nNo Restart After Auto Start/Stop Engages\n\nOn June 3, 2022, the O\ufb03ce of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened Preliminary Evaluation PE22005 after the agency received VOQs and several \ufb01eld reports concerning the Auto Idle Stop (AIS) feature on 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles. The complaints allege that the engine fails to restart on its own from a complete stop at a tra\ufb03c light or road intersection with the AIS function engaged. The subject vehicles are equipped with a 3.5L engine with a 9-speed automatic transmission.On January 6, 2023, Honda released service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009. These service bulletins address the failure to restart issue in the 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles, as well as the 2015-2020 Acura TLX, 2016-2020 Acura MDX, 2019-2022 Honda Passport, and 2020-2023 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.The repair outlined in the service bulletins is a two-stage countermeasure to remedy the issue. The first stage is a Programmed Fuel Injection (\u201cPGM-FI\u201d) software update. The second stage is only deployed if the software update fails to remedy the issue. The second stage, depending on the model and model year, consists of replacement of the starter assembly, starter relays, and a valve adjustment. Additionally, Honda extended the warranty coverage to 10 years with unlimited mileage for vehicles requiring the second stage component replacement.ODI continues to receive complaints of the AIS failure to restart, with many complainants alleging the campaign countermeasures had been completed.  NHTSA has reviewed Honda's Information Request Letter responses involving warranty claims, lawsuits, and consumer complaints in addition to ODI's own data.This Engineering Analysis is being opened to further consider the potential safety defect, including gathering additional data regarding Honda\u2019s service campaign efficacy. ODI is additionally expanding the scope to encompass all vehicles addressed in Honda\u2019s service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009 as well as newer model year vehicles, which are substantially similar to the vehicles covered by the service campaign.
