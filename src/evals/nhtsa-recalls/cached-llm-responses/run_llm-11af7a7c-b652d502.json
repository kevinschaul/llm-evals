This unrequested transmission downshift would cause unexpected rapid vehicle deceleration. Certain consumer complaints additionally allege that the vehicle's rear wheels temporarily lock, seize, and/or skid during the downshift resulting in a loss of vehicle control increasing the risk for crash and injury. ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to determine the scope and severity of the potential safety-related consequences.To review the reports cited in the attached Opening Resume ODI Report Identification Number document, go to NHTSA.gov.nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "{\"result\": true}", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 10:17:09"}
