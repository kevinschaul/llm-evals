The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), or fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\n2022-2023 Pratt Container Chassis Trailers\n\nOn November 13, 2023, Pratt Intermodal Chassis (Pratt) issued a safety recall (NHTSA Recall 23V-767) for 2022-2023 GN30402-EC-6P container chassis trailers manufactured December 6, 2021 through June 30, 2022. When the chassis is in the 20-foot configuration, the mid-beam of the chassis may bend or crack when fully loaded or when the 20-foot container is overloaded. A cracked or bent mid-beam can result in load separation or complete failure of the trailer, increasing the risk of a crash or injury.On January 3, 2024, the Office of Defect Investigations (ODI) received a consumer complaint alleging mid-beam cracking/bending on GN30402-EC-6P container chassis trailers manufactured prior to December 2021. The GN30402-EC-6P container chassis trailers built before December 2021 were produced by Pratt Industries LLC prior to the ownership change to Pratt Intermodal Chassis and are outside the scope of Recall 23V-767.ODI is opening this Recall Query (RQ) to evaluate the scope of Pratt Intermodal Chassis recall (NHTSA Recall 23V-767).
