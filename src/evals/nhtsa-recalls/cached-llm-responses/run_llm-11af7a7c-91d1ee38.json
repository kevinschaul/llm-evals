When the chassis is in the 20-foot configuration, the mid-beam of the chassis may bend or crack when fully loaded or when the 20-foot container is overloaded. A cracked or bent mid-beam can result in load separation or complete failure of the trailer, increasing the risk of a crash or injury.On January 3, 2024, the Office of Defect Investigations (ODI) received a consumer complaint alleging mid-beam cracking/bending on GN30402-EC-6P container chassis trailers manufactured prior to December 2021.
