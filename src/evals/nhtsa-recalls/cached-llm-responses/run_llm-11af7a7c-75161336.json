The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nLane Keep Assist System\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation has identified 14 Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) reports on 2023 through 2024 model year (MY) VinFast VF8 vehicles alleging problems with the Lane Keep Assist (LKA) system. The complaints allege the system can activate in error and not function properly. The VOQs allege the system has difficulty detecting lanes on the roadway, provides improper steering inputs, and is difficult to override by the driver. Improper steering inputs can result in high control effort required by the driver and increase the likelihood of a crash or injury.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to assess the scope, frequency, and severity of the potential problem and to determine if a safety related defect exists in the subject vehicles.
