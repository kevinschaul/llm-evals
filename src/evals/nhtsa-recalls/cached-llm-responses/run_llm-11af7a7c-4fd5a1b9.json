The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), \nor fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nIncorrect Tire Identification Number/FMVSS 574\n\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Company (Goodyear) is recalling certain Cooper Discoverer Stronghold AT tires, size LT275/65R18.  The tire identification number (TIN) is missing the 4-digit week and year code mark.  As such, these tires fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 574, \"Tire Identification & Recordkeeping.\"The inability to determine the production date of a tire can result in prolonged usage of a tire that should be replaced or unknowingly using a tire that has been recalled.  Both situations increase the risk of a crash.\n\nNumber of Units Affected: 170.0\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "{\"result\": false}", "cached_at": "2025-04-22 10:24:07"}
