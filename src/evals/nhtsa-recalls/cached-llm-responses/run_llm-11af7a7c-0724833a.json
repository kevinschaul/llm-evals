The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), or fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nSeat Belt Retractor Pretensioner Inadvertent Deployment\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 3 complaints alleging inadvertent deployment of the seat belt retractor pretensioner in model year 2019-2020 Ford Expedition vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Company. The complaints allege hearing a loud sound immediately followed by the seat belt rapidly tightening. The complaints do not allege a crash or impact occurred that may have resulted in the deployment of the pretensioner system. Additionally, the seat belt remains in a locked position after the deployment event.On February 9, 2024, Ford issued safety recall 24V-099 which included 2018-2020 Ford Expedition and 2018-2020 Lincoln Navigator vehicles equipped with driver and front passenger seat belt retractor pretensioners built between October 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019. This recall addressed a defective seat belt retractor pretensioner assembly that may develop corroded squib pins, resulting in high resistance or open circuit. This condition may result in retractor pretensioner inadvertent deployment and increased risk of injury due to loss of pretensioner protection and a seat belt that is locked in position.The complaints allege not being included in recall 24V-099 but experiencing the failure that it addressed. ODI is also aware of additional reports of alleged pretensioner inadvertent deployment in 2019-2020 Ford Expedition and 2018-2019 Lincoln Navigator vehicles produced outside the dates defined by 24V-099.ODI is opening this Recall Query (RQ) to assess the scope of recall 24V-099.
