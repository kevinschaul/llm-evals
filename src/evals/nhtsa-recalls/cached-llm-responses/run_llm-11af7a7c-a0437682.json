The Post is not interested in recalls, component failures (mechanical, electronic or hydraulic), or fuel leaks that haven't led to deaths or injuries, so you should return  `{\"result\": false}` for those.\n\nEVDM connector plate separation\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is aware of Electric Vehicle Distribution Module (EVDM) connector plate separation on Model Year (MY) 2020-2025 Freightliner eCascadia and MY 2022-2025 eM2 electric trucks. The EVDM connector plate contains multiple safety-related circuits including ABS, stability control and vehicle protective mechanisms to de-energize the High Voltage system. Separation of the EVDM connector plate can result in a loss of propulsion and increase the risk of a crash.An ODI review of Early Warning Reporting (EWR) submissions by Daimler Truck North America (DTNA) identified  vehicles describing Controller Area Network (CAN) and power faults caused by EVDM connector plate separation.To better understand the severity and frequency of EVDM connector plate separation on the subject vehicles, a Preliminary Evaluation (PE) is being opened.nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "{\"result\": true}", "cached_at": "2025-04-25 12:21:04"}
