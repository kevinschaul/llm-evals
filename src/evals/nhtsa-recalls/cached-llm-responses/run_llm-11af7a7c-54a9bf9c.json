Of these complaints, 16 describe a complete loss of motive power at speeds greater than 25 miles per hour, without the ability for the vehicle to resume normal operation. The subject vehicles can be up-fit as an ambulance and other emergency response vehicle or may be heavily loaded when used for towing. During the failure event, the snap ring becomes dislodged and forward gears 1-4 are no longer functional, potentially leaving the vehicle disabled in or near the roadway and/or negatively affect the emergency mission. ODI contacted the manufacturer, FCA US, LLC d/b/a Stellantis North America (FCA), and learned that technical service bulletin (TSB) TSB-21-002-23 is related to the alleged defect condition. Additionally, FCA has conducted dynamometer and field testing and has explained to ODI that during the event a warning message will display to the operator, and gear 5 and reverse will remain available.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related problems.
