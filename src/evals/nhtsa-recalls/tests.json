The complaints allege that the engine fails to restart on its own from a complete stop at a tra\ufb03c light or road intersection with the AIS function engaged. The subject vehicles are equipped with a 3.5L engine with a 9-speed automatic transmission.On January 6, 2023, Honda released service bulletins 23-008 and 23-009. These service bulletins address the failure to restart issue in the 2016-2019MY Honda Pilot vehicles, as well as the 2015-2020 Acura TLX, 2016-2020 Acura MDX, 2019-2022 Honda Passport, and 2020-2023 Honda Ridgeline vehicles.The repair outlined in the service bulletins is a two-stage countermeasure to remedy the issue. The first stage is a Programmed Fuel Injection (\u201cPGM-FI\u201d) software update. The second stage is only deployed if the software update fails to remedy the issue. The second stage, depending on the model and model year, consists of replacement of the starter assembly, starter relays, and a valve adjustment. Additionally, Honda extended the warranty coverage to 10 years with unlimited mileage for vehicles requiring the second stage component replacement.ODI continues to receive complaints of the AIS failure to restart, with many complainants alleging the campaign countermeasures had been completed.

(Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda\u2019s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda\u2019s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure.

NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI\u2019s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle\u2019s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford\u2019s response to ODI\u2019s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford\u2019s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles\u2019 event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency\u2019s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA\u2019s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Engineering Analysis (EA) is being opened to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers\u2019 ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports.

On August 26, 2024, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP24004 to evaluate the petitioner\u2019s request. No trailer manufacturer or equipment supplier was identified as the specific subject of the petition. The petition itself can be reviewed at NHTSA.gov under ODI Number 11599188.Currently, a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) requiring side underride guards on semi-trailers does not exist. The petitioner contends that a failure to include side underride guards equates to a safety defect in the semi-trailer\u2019s design, construction and performance. ODI was petitioned in 2021 for this same issue and, after evaluation, denied the request (DP21004). The petitioner here states that evidence of SUG effectiveness to prevent fatalities and mitigate serious injuries \u201chas continued to accumulate\u201d since the denial of DP21004. The petitioner also alleges that \u201c[d]espite a high severity of risk resulting in frequent severe or fatal injuries from side underride crashes, NHTSA has taken no action to investigate recalling semi-trailers without SUGs.\u201dPursuant to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), NHTSA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that summarized and requested comment on a 2022 NHTSA report with an analysis of potential effects of a requirement for side underride guards on new trailers and semitrailers. 88 Fed. Reg. 24536 (Apr. 21, 2023). NHTSA\u2019s Office of Rulemaking is currently reviewing over 2,000 comments received. Also pursuant to the IIJA, on June 18, 2024, the NHTSA-facilitated Advisory Committee on Underride Protection (ACUP) issued its biennial report to Congress and the Secretary of Transportation. This biennial report consists of a majority report and a minority report summarizing its work to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on safety regulations related to underride crashes that have caused severe injury and death. Though the committee\u2019s charter was extended through June 2025, the committee concluded its work following the publication of the biennial report in June 2024.In addition, NHTSA previously announced several actions related to truck trailer underride safety, including improving data collection of underride crashes by recommending inclusion of underride data in state crash data systems and by providing educational materials to state and local police departments on identifying and recording underride crashes. ODI also actively participates in the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) events where it has encouraged law enforcement to report underride crashes, and proposed CVSA focus on underride guards during the 2024 Operation Road Check, a nationwide 72-hour safety blitz. NHTSA is, further, conducting research on rear impact guard designs that better protect occupants of passenger vehicles in even more rear underride crash scenarios. And NHTSA, with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, published a pamphlet in August 2022\u2014which was distributed to law enforcement through various channels\u2014that explains how to identify and record such crashes (this pamphlet is available at https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/les/2022-08/Underride-Crash- Pamphlet_071522_v6atag.pdf).ODI searched its databases and found no injury or fatality trend specific to any make, model, or model year trailer within Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) and Early Warning Reporting (EWR) data and found one EWR report of vulnerable road user injury or fatalities. ODI also met, separately, with Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. (UTM) and Auto Haulers Association of America regarding UTM\u2019s SUG and to better understand the operational environment of low clearance vehicles, respectively. Based on the information available to the agency, trailer manufacturers continue to pursue side underride guard technology, and at least one manufacturer is currently offering an optional guard.The petitioner submitted two documents to ODI on September 11, 2024. The first was a letter from UTM to Marianne Karth (Petitioner of DP21004 & DP22004) which recounted UTM\u2019s testing of SUGs. The second document was an information sheet generated by the petitioner contesting UTM\u2019s claims. The petitioner also submitted certain documents to ODI on October 1, 2024, which the petitioner had previously submitted separately as part of comments on a collection of information pertaining to Reporting and Documents About Potential Defects (Docket No. NHTSA-2024-0055). This included 45 files regarding 49 unique crashes. ODI reviewed that information and found that of the 49 crashes, twenty-nine (29) potentially involved a subject vehicle. The majority of the 45 files were from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a NHTSA-maintained database of state crash data comprised of certain, albeit often relatively limited information. Notably, of the 29 files, only 2 included the make, model, and model year of the subject vehicle.After consideration of the petition, including the reports and documents provided by the petitioner, NHTSA believes the issues raised here are best addressed through its recent rulemaking and the ongoing actions under IIJA. Accordingly, NHTSA has decided not to open a defect investigation, and the petition is denied. The denial of this petition does not foreclose the agency from taking further action if warranted or making a future finding that a safety-related defect exists based upon additional information the agency may receive.nan\n\nNumber of Units Affected: nan"}, "expected_output": false, "name": "DP24004 2025-04-21T17:55:15.882956Z"}, {"inputs": {"content": "Trailer Hitch Receiver Structure may Crack and Separate\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 5 complaints for various 2016-2022 Thor Motor Coach motorhomes alleging that the trailer hitch receiver (\"hitch\") or recreational vehicle (RV) frame cracked and/or separated, including one which resulted in the towed item detaching and causing property damage.

It accomplishes this by converting the captured energy from the braking system into electricity for the battery pack, which is then used to power a variety of electrical components. ETorque engines replace the alternator with a 48-volt battery-powered belt drive and a motor generator. The motor generator provides extra torque to the crankshaft during gear changes. Simultaneously, the motor generator uses the 48-volt battery pack to increase torque.\u00a0Many of the complaints state that the vehicle's engine would shut off, often while travelling at slow speed, the vehicle would shift into park and apply the emergency brake.

(Honda). Recall 22V-867 addressed concerns of a loss of the Rear-View Camera (RVC) function in model year (MY) 2017-2019 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 22V-867 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a protective corrugated tubing which was insufficient to protect against bending wear and zip ties which were insufficiently tightened and would not keep the protective tubing in place. The consequence is that the RVC wire harness may fatigue and break after repeated opening and closing of the tailgate. This ultimately results in the failure of the RVC image to display due to a lack of connectivity. Honda\u2019s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness with longer protective corrugated tubing and sufficiently tightened zip ties. This remedy part was also installed as a production part in certain MY 2019 Ridgeline vehicles.On May 3, 2024, Honda submitted recall 24V-321 to ODI, addressing concerns of a loss of the RVC function in MY 2020-2024 Honda Ridgeline vehicles. Recall 24V-321 states that the RVC wire harness was manufactured with a material which was susceptible to breakage upon repeated opening and closing of the tailgate, which ultimately leads to a complete loss of RVC function. Honda\u2019s remedy identified in the recall filing was a replacement harness manufactured by a new supplier with improved material properties to withstand wear from bending. Since the remedy parts for recall 22V-867 and the production parts recalled under 24V-321 use the same supplier and materials for critical components in the RVC wire harness, ODI opened RQ24011.To date, ODI has received 1 allegation of a 22V-867 remedy RVC wire harness failure.

Three of the collisions were reported under Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), while the other collision was not reportable under the SGO.On March 13, 2025, Zoox \ufb01led a safety recall (NHTSA Recall No. 25E019) stating that in specific circumstances \u201cthe Zoox ADS software may have reacted over-cautiously and braked unnecessarily hard\u201d and that \u201cthe Zoox ADS software may have incorrectly anticipated a collision and braked unnecessarily hard.\u201d These behaviors could lead to increased risk of a rear-end collision caused by unnecessary hard braking. The Zoox recall report indicated that Zoox's ADS has been remedied through a software update that addresses the described defects. As of November 7, 2024, the updated software was released to all impacted Zoox vehicles.In view of the recall action taken by Zoox and ODI\u2019s analysis of the available data, including data presented by Zoox demonstrating a resolution of these hard braking incidents after the software update, ODI is closing this Preliminary Evaluation.

(Fisker). The complaints allege the activation of AEB without an apparent roadway obstruction in the vehicle\u2019s forward path, resulting in sudden vehicle deceleration. This sudden deceleration occurs without adequate warning or input from the driver. The braking applications range from momentary, partial application resulting in rapid loss of speed to full application, which brings the vehicle to a complete stop in the travel lane.ODI sent Fisker an Information Request (IR) letter on May 20, 2024. On June 17 and 19, 2024, Fisker and its affiliates filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Fisker provided an incomplete response to the IR on July 1, 2024. Limited information pertaining to system validation and failure data was provided. Fisker subsequently requested more time to provide additional responsive files due to limited available resources. Fisker sent additional responsive files on September 9, 2024, September 17, 2024, and December 16, 2024, but Fisker\u2019s response did not contain sufficient information for ODI to fully evaluate the alleged safety defect.Further, on December 27, 2024, the Fisker employees with whom ODI had been corresponding informed ODI that all Fisker employees were being \u201cdismissed\u201d as of that date. ODI therefore does not anticipate receiving any further responsive submissions such that it can fully evaluate the reports that led to this investigation. ODI performed phone interviews and sent a survey to consumers to obtain more information and validate the allegations. Additionally, ODI reviewed allegations of the alleged safety defect that were submitted to various online forums. Most of these reports were similar in nature to the reports received by ODI. Some of the reports in online forums appear to be duplicative reports that were also submitted to ODI. Based on the responses received and analysis of similar online reporting, there was no clear trend in the following factors pertaining to the allegations: reoccurrence of events (i.e., single or multiple incidents), speed immediately prior to the event, whether the event concluded in a reduction of speed or a full stop, roadway conditions, and warning immediately prior to the event.To date, between the reports provided by Fisker and complaints made directly to the agency, ODI is aware of over 20 reports alleging inadvertent AEB activation. Before the employees were dismissed, Fisker\u2019s testing done in response to the inadvertent AEB allegations reportedly did not result in any inadvertent AEB activations. The \u201cManufacturer\u201d and \u201cTotal\u201d counts in the above table have been left blank because of a pending request for confidential treatment by Fisker that could not be timely addressed given the company\u2019s status. This information factored into ODI\u2019s investigation and analysis.The available information does not warrant further action at this time.\u00a0 The closing of this investigation does not constitute a finding by NHTSA that a safety-related defect does not exist. Additionally, the Agency notes that the Vehicle Safety Act states: \u201cA manufacturer\u2019s filing of a petition in bankruptcy under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title 11 does not negate the manufacturer\u2019s duty to comply with section 30112 or sections 30115 through 30120 of this title,\u201d which include the recall provisions of the Act.

On December 12, 2023, Tesla filed a Defect Information Report (Recall 23V838) applicable to all Tesla models produced and equipped with any version of its Autopilot system, which Tesla described as an SAE Level 2 (L2) Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Autopilot is the simultaneous engagement of Tesla\u2019s Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) and Autosteer. In describing the safety defect, Tesla\u2019s Defect Information Report (DIR) explained that \u201cthe prominence and scope of the system\u2019s controls may be insufficient to prevent driver misuse,\u201d and Tesla committed to the deployment of a multipart remedy aimed at improving system and engagement controls and reducing mode confusion.EA22002 (upgraded from PE21020) was opened to investigate whether Tesla\u2019s Autopilot contained a defect that created an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety and involved extensive crash analysis, human factors analysis, vehicle evaluations, and assessment of vehicle control authority and driver engagement technologies. The work conducted in these investigations aligns with Tesla\u2019s conclusion in its 23V838 recall filing. During EA22002, ODI identified at least 13 crashes involving one or more fatalities and many more involving serious injuries in which foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.\u00a0\u00a0Tesla filed Recall 23V838 to address concerns regarding the Autopilot system investigated in EA22002.

NHTSA opened the investigation after the agency received notice of two fatal collisions involving BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles. Based on the incidents, NHTSA scoped the investigation to 2021-2024 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with BlueCruise. In June 2024, ODI sent an Information Request (IR) letter to Ford requiring that it provide certain information pertaining to crashes, non-crash reports, and technical specifications that relate to BlueCruise, as well as other Ford partial driving automation systems that offer lane and speed maintenance.In its response to ODI\u2019s IR, Ford stated that there are 2,539,962 Ford and Lincoln vehicles (including subject and peer vehicles) equipped with a partial driving automation system within the scope of the request. The majority of these vehicles are equipped with a system that Ford calls Lane Centering Assist (LCA), which is a hands-on partial driving automation system that combines longitudinal control authority governed by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lateral control authority governed by a steerable path. LCA is offered on a wide range of Ford and Lincoln models beginning in model year 2019. Vehicles that are equipped with BlueCruise, the focus of this investigation, have LCA capability and additionally offer hands-free partial driving automation when certain conditions are met. Hands-free BlueCruise operation is only offered on certain roadways and system availability is geofenced using vehicle GPS. BlueCruise-equipped vehicles employ a camera-based driver monitoring system to determine driver attentiveness to the roadway. BlueCruise was introduced in model year 2021 and is currently available in a select range of Ford and Lincoln vehicles.For BlueCruise- and LCA-equipped vehicles, both ACC and Pre-Collision Assist (PCA) features use a combination of camera and radar sensing technologies to detect and classify objects. ACC is specifically designed to detect vehicles (including cars, trucks, and motorcycles) and bicycles in front of the subject vehicle which are either stationary or moving in the same direction as the subject vehicle. Through this investigation, limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions have been identified. Specifically, due to the potential for false detection of stationary objects at long distances, Ford designed ACC to inhibit any response to reported stationary objects when the subject vehicle\u2019s approach speed is at or above 62 mph. Additionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.In addition to reviewing Ford\u2019s response to ODI\u2019s IR, the agency conducted a review of crash and non-crash reports identified collectively through Ford\u2019s IR response, incident reporting through Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO), and NHTSA vehicle owner questionnaires. In total, 32 crashes and 2,004 non-crash reports on subject and peer Ford vehicles were identified across manufacturer and ODI data sources. A detailed analysis of each crash was conducted including the review of any available police reports, photographs, data recovered from in-vehicle event data recorders, connected vehicle data, and/or other information.In both fatal collisions referenced in the PE24012 opening resume, the subject Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle was traveling over 70 mph on a controlled-access highway during nighttime lighting conditions with hands-free BlueCruise engaged when it collided with a stationary vehicle. Analysis of data imaged from the vehicles\u2019 event data recorders demonstrates that in each incident, the driver did not apply the brakes or take evasive steering action, and no deceleration was initiated by either the BlueCruise system or PCA prior to impact. Through the agency\u2019s crash analysis, four additional frontal collisions were identified where the subject Ford impacted a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle or another stationary object located in the travel lane. Two of these four incidents involved BlueCruise-equipped Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles (included in the failure report summary along with the fatal collisions discussed above), while the other two involved other Ford models equipped with the LCA system. Additionally, a trend was identified through analysis of the non-crash reports relating to allegations that ACC (the longitudinal component of both BlueCruise and LCA) failed to detect and/or respond to a stopped or slow-moving lead vehicle. In these reports, consumers often describe that the absence of deceleration initiated by ACC was unexpected and required harsh manual braking or intervention from the PCA to avoid a frontal collision with the lead vehicle.Based on NHTSA\u2019s analysis, system limitations relating to the detection of stationary vehicles while traveling at highway speeds and in nighttime lighting conditions appear to be factors in collisions under investigation and several apparently similar near-miss, non-crash reports. This Preliminary Evaluation is being upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA25001) to further investigate these system limitations and to evaluate drivers\u2019 ability to respond to scenarios that exceed system limitations. During the EA, the agency expects to, among other things, perform vehicle evaluations, review additional technical information, and perform additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports.

ODI contacted the manufacturer, FCA US, LLC d/b/a Stellantis North America (FCA), and learned that technical service bulletin (TSB) TSB-21-002-23 is related to the alleged defect condition. Additionally, FCA has conducted dynamometer and field testing and has explained to ODI that during the event a warning message will display to the operator, and gear 5 and reverse will remain available.ODI is opening this Preliminary Evaluation (PE) to evaluate the severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related problems.

This recall was in response to allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, increasing the risk of a crash and/or injury, and included approximately 153,581 vehicles. Ford identified the root cause of the unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear to be intermittent signal loss from the transmission\u2019s Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor due to solder joint cracks on the OSS circuit board as a result of manufacturing process issues. The OSS sensor is mounted onto the molded lead frame and transmits changes in transmission shaft speed to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). The remedy program described in safety recall 16V-248 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring.In December 2017, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened a Recall Query (RQ17-010) to assess the scope and remedy effectiveness of safety recall 16V-248. As a result of this ODI investigation, Ford issued safety recall 19V-075 to expand the scope of 16V-248 to include MY 2011-2013 Ford F-150 vehicles equipped with 6-speed (6R80) automatic transmissions and included approximately 1,263,051 vehicles. The remedy program described in safety recall 19V-075 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring. In June 2019, Ford issued safety recall 19V-433 as the remedy program used to service MY 2013 Ford F-150 5.0L and 6.2L vehicles in accordance with safety recall 19V-075 did not contain the necessary updates to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 107,857 vehicles.On March 27, 2024, ODI opened this Recall Query (RQ24-005) to investigate the scope of the above-described safety recalls. At the time that this investigation was opened, ODI had received 86 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) reporting allegations of unintended, unexpected vehicle transmission downshifting to a lower gear without warning, often accompanied by temporary rear wheel lock-up, in MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles. As a result of this Recall Query, Ford filled safety recall 24V-444 on June 14, 2024, to include MY 2014 Ford F-150 vehicles and expand the scope of safety recalls 16V-248, 19V-075 and 19V-433. The remedy program described in safety recall 24V-444 involved reprogramming of the PCM to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting from occurring and included approximately 552,188 vehicles.In its May 2024 response to ODI\u2019s information request, Ford concluded that a predominant root cause for the intermittent OSS signal loss has not been identified outside of the original safety recall (16V-248). Ford\u2019s investigation also concluded that the primary causes of the defect in MY 2014 F-150 vehicles were related to the molded lead frame and the control assembly transmission main. In the May 2024 response, Ford identified 2,184 total reports that described unintended vehicle transmission downshifting and rear wheel lock-up events; 1,441 warranty claims and 743 reports from consumer complaints, field reports, consumer surveys, and lawsuits/legal claims. Note that the values presented here and in the table above represent the total number of reports which can include a single consumer with multiple reports of the same event as well as a consumer with reports of multiple distinct events. Of the 1,441 warranty claims, 551 warranty claims involved repair of the molded lead frame (38%) and 509 warranty claims involved repair of the control assembly transmission main (35%).Ford has also stated that the PCM programming used to prevent unintended vehicle transmission downshifting was implemented starting with MY 2015 vehicle #1 production and onward.In view of the safety recall action being taken by Ford, ODI is closing this Recall Query (RQ24-005). The agency reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by future circumstances.
