Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nElon Musk urges far-right German party to move beyond \u2018past guilt\u2019\nGreeted with loud cheers, Elon Musk virtually delivered a short speech Saturday at a rally for the far-right<b> </b>Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, where he urged the crowd to not be ashamed of their country\u2019s history.\nMusk\u2019s appearance comes amid debate over whether<b> </b>a gesture he made<b> </b>twice during<b> </b>an inauguration rally was a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/21/elon-musk-salute-trump-inauguration/\" target=_blank>Nazi-style salute</a>, which he denies. He was introduced by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/09/elon-musk-alice-weidel-afd-germany/\" target=_blank>Alice Weidel</a>, the AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor. At the rally in Halle, Musk encouraged the roughly 4,500 attendees to be proud of their German heritage.\n\u201cThere is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that. Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great-grandparents,\u201d Musk said, seeming to reference the country\u2019s history when the Nazis rose to power.\n\u201cYou should be optimistic and excited about a future for Germany,\u201d said Musk, as the crowd applauded.\n\nThe SpaceX CEO reiterated his praise for AfD, telling supporters, \u201cI think you\u2019re the best hope for Germany.\u201d\nWeidel thanked Musk for his support after his remarks and said, \u201cMake Germany great again!\u201d echoing President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d  slogan.\nThe same day, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/25/germany-afd-protests-farright-elections/ff7f47e6-db3f-11ef-85a9-331436ec61e9_story.html\" target=_blank>protesters</a> took to the streets in Berlin and Cologne, singing anti-fascist songs and denouncing the AfD.\n\u201cThose who fuel racism and attack climate protection are not just campaigning, they are endangering lives,\u201d Luisa Neubauer, a climate activist, told the crowd, according to the Associated Press. Police say about 35,000 protesters showed up in Berlin, while the Cologne rally had about 40,000 attendees.\nAfD is considered by Germany\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/13/germany-afd-extremist-party-court/\" target=_blank>domestic intelligence service to be a suspected extremist organization</a>. The party\u2019s youth arm and its regional AfD branches in three of Germany\u2019s 16 states are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/13/germany-afd-extremist-party-court/\" target=_blank>classified as</a> \u201cconfirmed right-wing extremist.\u201d\nAsked about Musk\u2019s comments Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he does not believe Musk is a Nazi, \u201cbut what he said does bother me in this regard.\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow is the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/25/auschwitz-nazi-germany-oswiecim-anniversary/0729859e-dada-11ef-85a9-331436ec61e9_story.html\" target=_blank>80th anniversary of liberating Auschwitz</a>,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI was just there a few months ago. You know, I don\u2019t expect the Germans to be, racked with collective guilt all their lives. But I do hope in German schools they educate the German children about what happened in Germany. I hope in our schools that we\u2019ll educate people.\u201d\n\nMusk <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/20/elon-musk-afd-germany/\" target=_blank>backed the AfD in late December</a>, drawing a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/30/musk-germany-far-right-afd-welt-op-ed/\" target=_blank>harsh rebuke from the German government</a> with accusations that the tech mogul was \u201ctrying to influence the federal election.\u201d The election is  set for Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally scheduled after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/16/olaf-scholz-confidence-vote-germany-election/\" target=_blank>lost<b> </b>a vote of confidence</a> in mid-December.\nOn Jan. 9, Musk interviewed Weidel on X, the social platform he owns. The two agreed that Germany\u2019s education sponsored a \u201cwokeish, leftist\u201d agenda and said that speech regulations were comparable to Adolf Hitler\u2019s media censorship.\nThe interview had about 200,000 listeners.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:10:42"}
