Under the Trump administration, thousands of federal employees have been laid off across the country, <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/02/layoffs-hit-thousands-of-usda-employees-across-the-country-00204481\" target=\"_blank\">including</a> at <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/19/bird-flu-usda-doge-musk-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">USDA</a>.\n\u201cTaking climate change information off websites, freezing funds, and laying off USDA workers that are helping to protect communities is ludicrous,\u201d said Wes Gillingham, board president of NOFA-NY, which represents  farmers, gardeners and consumers advocating for organic and sustainable food and farming.\nAccording to the suit, on Jan. 30, USDA Director of Digital Communications Peter Rhee told staff members in an email that they had about 24 hours to \u201cidentify and archive or unpublish any landing pages focused on climate change,\u201d and instructed them to sort other webpages into tiers based on how much they mentioned climate change and give a \u201crecommendation on how the content should be handled.\u201d\nUSDA staff members then \u201cacted swiftly to purge department websites of climate-change-focused webpages,\u201d the lawsuit stated \u2014 creating confusion and chaos as resources for farmers and the public suddenly became inaccessible, \u201cwithout any public notice or explanation.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, government agencies have removed material relating to topics deemed objectionable by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/federal-agencies-websites-trump/\" target=_blank>from their websites</a>, including references to diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as references to climate change and initiatives to combat it.\nThe lawsuit claimed that in deleting the materials so quickly and without notice, USDA violated the <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-104publ13/pdf/PLAW-104publ13.pdf\" target=_blank>Paperwork Reduction Act</a>, which requires agencies to provide notice when terminating \u201csignificant information dissemination products,\u201d and the Freedom of Information Act. The groups also sued under<b> </b>the <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10558\" target=_blank>Administrative Procedure Act</a>, which allows people to request judicial reviews of certain harmful agency actions.\nThe suit asked the court to declare USDA\u2019s actions unlawful and order the department to restore the deleted webpages and not to comply further with the Jan. 30 directive.\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/presidential-candidates-2024-policies-issues/donald-trump-climate-change/\" target=_blank>Trump has long rejected climate science</a> and in his first term aggressively targeted policies aimed at protecting the environment and lowering planet-warming emissions. He has called climate change \u201can expensive hoax,\u201d and in 2016, he told The Post\u2019s editorial board that he is \u201cnot a great believer in man-made climate change.\u201d But he also <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/10/21060410/trump-climate-change-book\" target=_blank>said in 2020</a> that \u201cthe environment is very important to me.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:10:01"}
