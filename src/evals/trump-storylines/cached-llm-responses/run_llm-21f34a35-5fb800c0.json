{"args": ["claude-3.5-sonnet", "\nIs this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTransgender troops will be removed from U.S. military, Pentagon says\nOpenly transgender service members will be disqualified from serving in the U.S. military and will soon be removed from<b> </b>the ranks, according to a Pentagon memo<b> </b>that marks a significant shift from previous Defense Department policy that prohibited discrimination based on gender identity.\nThe memo was made public Wednesday as part of a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/18/judge-trump-trans-troops-ban-animus/\" target=_blank>lawsuit filed by LGBTQ+ rights groups</a> against an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/28/trump-transgender-troops-military-hegseth/\" target=_blank>executive order</a> signed last month by President Donald Trump, which stated that the \u201cmedical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria\u201d are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the high standards expected of U.S. troops.\nAn earlier memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had said that people with a history of gender dysphoria would no longer be able to join the military but that they would be \u201ctreated with dignity and respect.\u201d The new memo goes a step further in stating that current service members will be removed if they have gender dysphoria or a history of it.\nThe memo states that exceptions could be made for transgender service members who directly support \u201cwarfighting capabilities\u201d if the government feels it has a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason to retain them.\nRights group have decried the push to ban transgender troops and say transgender people have served in the military with distinction for years without issue.\nSPARTA Pride, a rights group for transgender troops, said thousands of transgender people are serving in the military and are \u201cfully qualified\u201d for their positions. \u201cNo policy will ever erase transgender Americans\u2019 contribution to history, warfighting, or military excellence,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cTransgender service members have a unique fighting spirit and will continue to defend the constitution and American Values no matter what lies ahead.\u201d\nThe memo states that service members who are diagnosed with, have a history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria \u2014 a condition that involves feelings of psychological or physical discomfort tied to one\u2019s gender identity \u2014 are disqualified from military service. Also disqualified are service members who have been treated for gender dysphoria with hormones or surgery.\nThe memo directs the secretaries of each branch to identify service members with gender dysphoria within 30 days and to \u201cbegin separation actions\u201d within 30 days after that.\nThe affected service members will be honorably discharged as long as they meet normal conditions and qualify for involuntary separation pay, the memo states. If they voluntarily step down, they will be eligible to be paid twice as much under voluntary separation pay, it said.\nThe memo also states that the military will no longer pay for any treatments or surgery relating to service members\u2019 gender dysphoria.\nEven if a transgender service member obtains a waiver to stay in the military, they will face restrictions, the memo says. They cannot access \u201cintimate spaces,\u201d including changing rooms, bathrooms and showers, reserved for members of the gender they transitioned to. They will also have to meet the same physical<b> </b>standards as those of the sex they were assigned at birth, and their military records will be updated to reflect their sex assigned at birth.\nAbout 4,200 service members have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to a senior defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Trump administration. That figure includes active-duty, reserve and National Guard personnel.\nBetween 2015 and 2024, the military spent about $52 million on transgender service members\u2019<b> </b>psychotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery and other treatments, the senior defense official said. About 1,000 service members had transition-related surgeries during that period, while about 3,200 received hormone therapy, the official said.\nOpenly transgender people have been allowed to serve in the military since 2016, when the Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/06/30/the-pentagons-ban-on-transgender-service-just-fell-but-the-details-are-complicated/\" target=_blank>repealed a ban on transgender service</a>, citing the value of ensuring that all qualified individuals were able to serve their country in uniform. Previously, the military considered transgender people to be unfit for service.\nObama had also, in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/military-certifies-repeal-of-dont-ask-policy/2011/07/22/gIQAye15TI_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d</a> a policy that prohibited openly gay service members from serving, and, in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/12/03/pentagon-chief-to-announce-how-womens-roles-in-the-military-will-expand/\" target=\"_blank\">opened more combat roles to women</a>. In 2016, Rand published a <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1530.html\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> that found those changes in long-standing policy \u201chad no significant effect on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness\u201d and that concluded there was a \u201cminimal likely impact on force readiness\u201d from allowing openly transgender people to serve too.\nIn subsequent years, military leaders reported no significant harm from allowing openly transgender people to serve. In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2018, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley told Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) that he had \u201creceived precisely zero reports of issues of cohesion, discipline, morale\u201d caused by integrating transgender service members.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, the Defense Department effectively prohibited transgender people from joining the military but allowed those already in uniform to stay on. The policy was challenged in court, but the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-allows-trump-restrictions-on-transgender-troops-in-military-to-go-into-effect-as-legal-battle-continues/2019/01/22/e68a7284-1763-11e9-88fe-f9f77a3bcb6c_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">upheld Trump\u2019s partial ban in 2019</a>. The military <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/military-to-begin-enforcing-restrictions-on-trumps-transgender-troops/2019/03/13/cf2a0530-4587-11e9-9726-50f151ab44b9_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">began enforcing that policy</a> later that year.\nPresident Joe Biden quickly reversed Trump\u2019s ban in an executive order after taking office in 2021.\nWednesday\u2019s memo, which goes further than the policy implemented during Trump\u2019s first term, was released as part of a <a href=\"https://www.glad.org/cases/talbott-v-trump/\" target=_blank>lawsuit</a> filed by GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights on behalf of six transgender service members and two individuals seeking to enlist in the military. The suit alleges that Trump\u2019s ban on transgender service members violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.\nThe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is considering a <a href=\"https://www.glad.org/servicemembers-seek-immediate-block-of-transgender-military-ban/\" target=_blank>motion</a> to block enforcement of the ban until the outcome of the lawsuit is determined. The next hearing is scheduled for next month.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:22:04"}
