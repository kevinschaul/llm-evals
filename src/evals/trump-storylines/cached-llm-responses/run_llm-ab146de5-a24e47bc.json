Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nNative leaders warn that freezing of federal funds could imperil some services\nNative American leaders said they\u2019re worried about the impact of a freeze on federal grants and loans that could affect dozens of programs that provide a range of services including food, health care, education, housing and law enforcement.\nThe United States has more than 570 federally recognized tribes, and many receive some type of funds to provide programs and services for their tribal citizens through the federal government.\nAdvocates and leaders in tribal communities said they\u2019re concerned that many tribes are not in a financial position to fully fund their citizens\u2019 needs without federal money.\n\u201cEverybody is scrambling in Indian Country,\u201d said Brian Weeden, chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe in Massachusetts, which has about 4,000 enrolled citizens and whose tribe receives grant funds from the federal government.\n\u201cTribes are trying to figure it out,\u201d he said, \u201cand draw down programs to make sure they can stay afloat.\u201d\nJosh Arce, president and chief executive of Partnership with Native Americans \u2014 a nonprofit group that provides services and aid to more than 150 tribal communities in remote areas of the Southwest and northern plains \u2014 said \u201cwe\u2019re pretty surprised\u201d about the freeze.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something we thought we\u2019d wake up to on a Tuesday morning,\u201d he said, \u201cand it could impact so many things for Native American communities, from road and bridge programs to childhood education and nutrition efforts for the elderly.\u201d\nArce said some tribes use the federal grants for much-needed services, and \u201cif they don\u2019t have the ability to offset the loss, we don\u2019t know what that could look like for continuing essential programs or starting new programs for the year.\u201d\n\u201cThat means communities that have basic needs could see those needs go unmet,\u201d he said. Programs that pay for firewood or propane gas to heat homes or distribute food could be hurt, he said.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:05:57"}
