Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nPope shows \u2018slight improvement\u2019 amid special prayers at St. Peter\u2019s\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis remained in critical condition Monday as the Vatican held the first nightly rosary recitation in St. Peter\u2019s Square, underscoring concern over the 88-year-old pontiff\u2019s health.\nThere was some measure of positivity Monday night. The Vatican said that Francis, who has been suffering from double pneumonia, showed \u201ca slight improvement\u201d over the course of the day and after a restful night. He had no further asthmatic episodes, and some laboratory tests had improved, it said.\nAs thousands of people converged on St. Peter\u2019s Square, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican\u2019s secretary of state, called on prayer to support Francis \u201cin this moment of illness and trial and help him to recover his health soon.\u201d\nVatican officials said this was the first time in their recollection that a special saying of the rosary had been held for Francis. Under a steady drizzle, priests, nuns, religious pilgrims and Romans recited the rosary inside the colonnaded square. Cardinals and senior clerics sat at the top of the stairs in front of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The altar consisted of a gold-framed depiction of the Virgin Mary cast against the evening darkness under a white canopy.\nAttendees were somber as they prayed, some visibly moved.\n\u201cThe pope is the most important person in the world for us,\u201d said Wiestow Piosecki, 43, an IT specialist from eastern Poland. He brought his wife and three children to Rome for the jubilee and were devastated when the pope fell ill. \u201cHis voice is important, especially with the war in Ukraine. I feel afraid now, afraid he may die. I feel my prayer can help.\u201d\n\nDue to the complexity of his clinical picture, the pope\u2019s doctors at Rome\u2019s Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital were still not prepared to offer a prognosis. In the morning, Francis received Holy Communion, and he worked in the afternoon and was eating solid food.<b> </b>In the evening, he called the parish priest in Gaza whom he has spoken with almost daily throughout the war to offer his \u201cpaternal closeness.\u201d Francis, the Vatican said, also offered thanks to those who have gathered in recent days to pray for his health.\nA mild renal insufficiency disclosed on Sunday, the Vatican said, was not \u201ccause for concern.\u201d The pope\u2019s oxygen therapy continued, although with slightly reduced flows and percentage of oxygen.\nFrancis\u2019s health crisis stretched into the end of its 10th day, making this the longest of his four hospitalizations as pope. Some senior clerics spoke in stark terms over the weekend about his chances. The hospital chaplain said Monday that it was time \u201cto hope against hope.\u201d\nIn recent days, Catholic churches around the globe, including in Francis\u2019s native Argentina, have prayed for the first New World pontiff. On Sunday, Cardinal Baldassare Reina, the vicar general of the Diocese of Rome, held a Mass for the pope, while encouraging other pastors in the diocese to do the same.\nThe saying of the rosary during a papal health crisis is seen as a spiritual gesture to pray for an especially ailing pope. In 2005, Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, then the undersecretary of state for the Vatican, announced the death of John Paul II to the crowds gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square after they finished saying the rosary for him.\nGiovanni Maria Vian, a former editor of the Vatican\u2019s newspaper and a historian of early Christianity, said the St. Peter\u2019s event on Monday night for Francis also reminded him of a saying of the rosary before the passing of Pope John XXIII in 1963.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure numberless such rosaries have been said at Gemelli,\u201d he said. \u201cThis [event] feels closer to the prayers in St. Peter\u2019s Square when [John Paul II] and [John XXIII] were dying, back in 2005 and 1963. I was there as a boy, and later [as an adult].\u201d\nIn the upper echelons of the Roman Catholic Church, speculating on the health of a pope has long been delicate terrain. But some senior clerics have offered surprisingly candid assessments. On Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/nyc-archbishop-timothy-dolan-worries-about-health-pope-francis-says-its-not-looking-good\" target=\"_blank\">Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York said, </a>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be kind of realistic. \u2026 It\u2019s not looking good.\u201d\nFrancis\u2019s doctors have sought to convey more optimism, suggesting his life is only at risk if he develops serious complications.\nTalk of his condition is partly due to the pope\u2019s own quest for transparency. His doctors say he has insisted on offering only the \u201ctruth\u201d to the public, and the extent of the medical disclosures has been unusual for the Vatican, which is traditionally guarded about a sitting pope\u2019s health.\nFrancis was admitted to the hospital with a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/17/pope-francis-illness-vatican-hospital/\" target=_blank>respiratory tract infection</a> on Feb. 14.\nLate Tuesday, the Vatican said CAT scans had revealed the pope to have double pneumonia. Chest X-rays showed he had developed a polymicrobial infection that arose from asthmatic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, a condition in which the airways widen, leading to a buildup of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. It said he was undergoing a \u201ccomplex\u201d treatment using antibiotic cortisone therapy.\nOn Saturday, the Vatican acknowledged in a written bulletin that Francis was in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/22/pope-francis-critical-asthma/\" target=_blank>critical condition</a>.\u201d It added that he had suffered a \u201cprolonged asthmatic crisis\u201d and a low platelet count. He was alert and sitting in an armchair, it said, but suffering more pain than the day before.\nIn a Sunday evening update, the Vatican said the pope\u2019s condition remained \u201ccritical\u201d but that there had been no recurrence of the respiratory crisis. He received treatment to boost his red blood cells. Blood tests showed \u201cmild\u201d renal insufficiency but that it was \u201cunder control.\u201d The pope, officials said, continued to receive high-flow oxygen through a nasal tube.\nCardinal Gianfranco Ravasi marveled at the level of detail being released about a pope\u2019s health. He told Corriere della Sera last week: \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how his conditions have been clearly explained. There used to be a tendency to conceal things related to the [the pope], like the Soviet bulletins in which the secretary had but a cold until he died. Now we go into detail. The \u2018polymicrobial infection.\u2019 The \u2018bilateral pneumonia.\u2019\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:28:07"}
