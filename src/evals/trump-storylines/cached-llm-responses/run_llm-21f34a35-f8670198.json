Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nVaccine meeting to prepare for coming winter\u2019s flu season canceled\nTrump officials have canceled a federal vaccine advisory committee meeting expected to be held<b> </b>next month that was intended to help select the makeup of next winter\u2019s influenza vaccine.\nThis is the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/\">second federal vaccine advisory panel that has been postponed</a> or canceled since <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/12/how-rfk-jr-once-long-shot-arrived-precipice-trumps-cabinet/\">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, was sworn in as health and human services secretary.\nThe Food and Drug Administration notified members of its vaccine advisory committee Wednesday that a planned March 13 meeting was canceled, according to an email sent to members that was read to The Washington Post. No reason was provided.\nThe email warned members against forwarding the email. It suggested members decline to answer questions from media.\nHHS and the FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/10/flu-cases-increase-influenza-cdc/\">Influenza viruses</a> change year to year, so vaccines must be updated annually. Federal health officials pick the flu strains that the vaccine will target in advance of the flu season because the production process takes several months.\nThe FDA usually holds a meeting of its expert panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, in March to accommodate tight manufacturing deadlines and go over discussions about flu strain selection led by the World Health Organization.\nThe FDA advisory panel meeting includes public presentations from WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Defense, said Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and a critic of Kennedy\u2019s.\n\u201cWhat is the plan for picking this year\u2019s flu strain?\u201d Offit said.\nLast week, Trump officials <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/\">postponed</a> a three-day meeting of the vaccine advisory panel to the CDC that was scheduled to begin Wednesday.\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Kennedy repeatedly denied that he is anti-vaccine, contending that he is simply seeking more data and pledging not to undermine confidence in the shots. But public health experts have long warned that as HHS secretary, Kennedy could use his authority to undermine vaccine safety and effectiveness. A pivotal swing vote in Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) said he grappled with his vote but later said he had received a list of commitments from Kennedy that included protecting vaccine oversight.\nKennedy was critical of the CDC vaccine panel during his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/30/rfk-health-secretary-confirmation-hearings/\">confirmation process</a> and has argued that federal agencies are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/18/trump-health-firings-fda-cdc/\">captive</a> to the industries they regulate.\n\u201cWe will remove conflicts of interest on the committees and research partners whenever possible, or balance them with other stakeholders,\u201d Kennedy said in remarks to HHS staff earlier this month.\nAn executive order issued by President Donald Trump last week to reduce federal bureaucracy said White House officials would identify \u201cunnecessary governmental entities and Federal Advisory Committees that should be terminated on grounds that they are unnecessary.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes.
