Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nFormer Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio arrested outside U.S. Capitol\nU.S. Capitol Police arrested former Proud Boys leader Henry \u201cEnrique\u201d Tarrio on Friday following an exchange with a woman who showed up to protest a news conference he called outside the U.S. Capitol.\nTarrio, 43, was charged with simple assault after authorities say she shoved her phone in his face and he struck her phone and arm. Officers witnessed the exchange, which they said in a statement occurred as Tarrio was walking near Delaware Avenue NE and D Street NE.\n\u201cThe woman told our officers that she wanted to be a complainant, and the man was arrested for the simple assault,\u201d Capitol Police spokesman Tim Barber said in<b> </b>the statement.\nIn response to a request for comment, Tarrio wrote in a text message: \u201cI have no problem with people screaming or bullhorn if us but the moment you put your hands on me...which she did...I\u2019m reacting. In this case...I launched her phone.\u201d\nThe alleged confrontation came after Tarrio announced plans to file a lawsuit against the Department of Justice in response to the Capitol riot prosecutions \u201cfor their murders, their lies and the endless suffering they have put us through.\u201d Tarrio said Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola \u2014 Proud Boys who were convicted and imprisoned for their role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack \u2014 will be joining him as plaintiffs.\nTarrio said they will be filing the suit in \u201cthe next two to three weeks maximum\u201d and did not share further details. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes said at the news conference that he will be filing a separate lawsuit.\nOnce filed, these suits could force the Trump administration to either defend the prosecutions related to the Jan. 6 attack or pay damages to the Proud Boys at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\nTarrio and other speakers at the news conference were found guilty of seditious conspiracy in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the building as lawmakers were attempting to certify election results. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/interactive/2025/jan-6-trump-pardons/\" target=_blank>More than 140 officers</a> were wounded and three people died as a result of medical emergencies suffered during the riot. Four police officers who worked that day later died by suicide.\n\u201cWe will not allow the government to rewrite history,\u201d Tarrio, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/20/trump-pardons-jan-6-defendants/\" target=_blank>who was sentenced to 22 years in prison</a>, said during the news conference, held roughly a month after Trump pardoned virtually all Capitol riot defendants and commuted the sentences of the remaining 14.\n\u201cThe government overplayed their hand. They thought we would break,\u201d he said. \u201cThey thought we would fail. But look at us now.\u201d\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia) <a href=\"https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=6255\" target=_blank>sent a letter</a> to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) on Friday expressing his concern that Tarrio and Rhodes returned to the Capitol on Friday and requesting Johnson \u201ctake meaningful action by acknowledging and condemning the violence that occurred on January 6th.\u201d\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pardons breathe new life into and embolden violent extremists, posing a real danger to our fellow Members of Congress and their staffs, the Capitol Police, and the millions of visitors to the Capitol each year,\u201d he wrote.\nTarrio was arrested Jan. 4, 2021, and later served four months in prison for burning a Black Lives Matter flag at a historic downtown African American church during a post-2020 election Trump demonstration. Tarrio pleaded guilty to destruction of property along with attempted possession of a high-capacity ammunition magazine found in his luggage when he was arrested after arriving in Washington for Trump\u2019s Jan. 6, 2021, demonstration.\nTarrio said in an interview earlier this week that he returned to Washington to reunite with other Proud Boys in town for the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.\nDuring the news conference, a few protesters brought a noise machine and megaphone to heckle the speakers, calling them \u201cNazis\u201d and \u201cterrorists,\u201d while Tarrio, Rhodes and other Proud Boys repeated a revisionist history of the attack that cast themselves as persecuted patriots. Capitol Police kept the two groups apart, and there did not appear to be any physical confrontations at that time.\nThe small crowd of Proud Boys and others involved in the Jan. 6 attack then walked around the outside of the U.S. Capitol, taking selfies, group photos and at one point erupting in chants of \u201cWe won!\u201d\nShortly after, Tarrio was arrested as live-streamers and journalists recorded police escorting him away.\n<i>Spencer S.
