Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nHeart disease remains the top cause of death in the U.S.\nCardiovascular disease remains<b> </b>the leading cause of death in the United States and accounted for 941,652 deaths in 2022, according to a <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/-/media/PHD-Files-2/Science-News/2/2025-Heart-and-Stroke-Stat-Update/2025-Statistics-At-A-Glance.pdf?sc_lang=en\" target=_blank>report</a> published by the American Heart Association.\nIn the United States in 2022, heart disease and stroke killed more people than all forms of cancer and accidental deaths. Coronary heart disease was the leading cause of death attributable to cardiovascular disease (39.5 percent), followed by stroke (17.6 percent), other cardiovascular diseases (17 percent), hypertensive diseases (14 percent), heart failure (9.3 percent) and diseases of the arteries (2.6 percent), the AHA said. More people died of cardiovascular causes in 2022 than 2021, when there were 931,578 cardiovascular deaths, according to the report.\nThe report also notes that between 2017 and 2020, nearly half of U.S. adults (48.6 percent) had some form of cardiovascular disease. According to the AHA, 59 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 58.9 percent of non-Hispanic Black men had cardiovascular disease.\nAdvances in clinical diagnosis and treatment have lessened the burden of heart disease over time, but more needs to be done to treat major risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes, said Keith Churchwell, a physician and clinical professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine who serves as volunteer president of the American Heart Association.\n\u201cWe need to stop these risk factors in their tracks, keep people healthy throughout their lifespan,\u201d he said in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-disease-remains-leading-cause-of-death-as-key-health-risk-factors-continue-to-rise\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>. \u201cThat will only be possible with a strong emphasis on early prevention and equitable health access for all.\u201d\n<i>This article is part of The Post\u2019s \u201cBig Number\u201d series, which takes a brief look at the statistical aspect of health issues.
