{"args": ["claude-3.5-sonnet", "\nIs this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nCongress ignores looming shutdown to focus on tax cuts, agency layoffs\nWith President Donald Trump and GOP leaders distracted by other issues, Congress is on the verge of bungling its way into a shutdown of federal agencies in less than three weeks.\nTrump and his advisers, particularly Elon Musk, have devoted the first month in office to trying to rip apart federal agencies that they don\u2019t like while also upending traditional foreign policy alliances. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) have battled over how fast to move all of Trump\u2019s agenda, including at least $4.5 trillion in tax cuts at a time when the national debt is ballooning.\nBut those issues are likely to take months to fully negotiate and navigate through complex procedures. The most pressing problem \u2014 keeping the federal government open past the March 14 deadline \u2014 has been virtually ignored by top leaders.\nAnd unlike the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/20/government-shutdown-bill-continuing-resolution/\" target=\"_blank\">most recent shutdown</a> deadlines, the politics of the moment are not aligned to bring the two parties together with an obvious last-minute deal that simply adds more money for each side\u2019s favored projects.\nInstead, many Democrats have grown so livid about Trump and Musk\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/08/elon-musk-doge-federal-agencies-cuts-employees/\" target=_blank>dismantling of agencies</a> such as the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 ignoring laws approved by Congress and signed by previous presidents \u2014 that many Democrats say <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/09/democrats-government-shutdown-trump-musk/\" target=_blank>they will oppose</a> a new round of government funding without guarantees that Trump and Musk will abide by these laws.\nIn outlining what they are seeking, Sen. Patty Murray (Washington), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, <a href=\"https://x.com/jackfitzdc/status/1892645594465710532\" target=_blank>summed it up thus on Thursday</a>: \u201cSimply an assurance that, if there\u2019s going to be Democratic votes, that the president and Elon Musk will follow the law and they won\u2019t just take our bill that we worked really hard on and rip it up.\u201d\nRepublicans know that without any Democratic votes, the government will shut down. To boot, at least a half dozen anti-government conservatives in the House, sometimes several dozen, refuse to vote for even the most basic bill funding the government.\nJohnson\u2019s historically narrow majority affords him just one defection to pass something with only Republican votes.\n\u201cRepublicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. It is their responsibility to find the votes to pass the final measures,\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Connecticut), the ranking minority-party member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement provided to The Washington Post on Friday.\nDeLauro labeled Musk \u201can unchecked billionaire\u201d whose actions have turned this negotiation from a relatively easy one to \u201cnot normal times\u201d with a high degree of risk.\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who spent 28 years climbing the Appropriations Committee ladder to finally secure the chair\u2019s gavel last month, summed up the dire state of play.\n\u201cI believe we\u2019re at impasse. We\u2019ve made four good-faith offers,\u201d Collins told reporters in the Capitol, adding that the Democrats have not made a real counteroffer. \u201cWe\u2019ve received only a perfunctory response.\u201d\nThe divide is epitomized by a pair of collegial committee members who usually forge deals but instead are now casting blame.\nSen. Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) noted that there is general agreement on funding levels that mirror <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/09/30/government-shutdown-averted/\" target=_blank>a deal worked out in 2023</a>. Republicans are willing to divvy up agency funds at those levels even though the leaders who negotiated that pact \u2014 Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy \u2014 are no longer in office.\n\u201cIf the Democrats want to do a shutdown, they can do it by simply refusing to move forward,\u201d Rounds said.\nSen. Chris Coons (D-Delaware) grew livid at the suggestion that Democrats are blocking a deal.\n\u201cLook, the Trump administration is already shutting the government down,\u201d Coons said.\nIn recent years, he oversaw funding dedicated to USAID and other foreign aid programs, Coons said. \u201cIt has specific and concrete language that says you cannot restructure USAID without congressional approval. They just did it. They just did it. So this is not hypothetical. It is not hyperbole. It is a completely understandable concern.\u201d\nThe Democrats are demanding an agreement written into the package to require Trump to abide by these spending bill outlines. That is the sort of thing that resides above the pay grade of the House and Senate Appropriations committee leaders.\nThose types of \u201criders,\u201d as they are known by insiders, require negotiations among Thune, Johnson and their Democratic counterparts, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (New York) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (New York), as well as the administration.\nBut Trump is not paying close attention to insider machinations on Capitol Hill. Johnson and Thune\u2019s spat has gone on for almost three months now, over one or two bills using the fast-track route to pass legislation on party-line votes.\nEach time Trump has seemed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/07/trump-backs-one-big-beautiful-bill-perils-await/\" target=_blank>to force a path</a> \u2014 like his social media posts Wednesday morning <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/20/senate-budget-trump-tax-cuts-deportations/479e78ec-efe2-11ef-bd80-8f2ac5c75a8a_story.html\" target=_blank>supporting Johnson\u2019s one \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d</a> \u2014 he contradicts the decision soon after. (Early Wednesday afternoon, Vice President JD Vance met with GOP senators and gave them the green light to continue their two-bill approach.)\nTrump has spent more<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/11/17/donald-trump-pga-liv-golf/?utm_campaign=wp_sports&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter\" target=_blank> personal time</a> trying to negotiate a truce to professional golf\u2019s civil war \u2014 including <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/20/pga-tour-saudi-pif-trump-white-house/\" target=_blank>a three-hour meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday that included Tiger Woods</a> \u2014 than he has dedicated to trying to hammer out a deal to keep the government funded.\nThune devoted the past week to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/21/senate-budget-border-trump-immigration/\" target=_blank>Senate passage of a budget resolution</a> that is a first step on the way toward increased border and defense spending. If successful that way, Thune would come back later in the year to pass another GOP-only bill including tax cuts.\nJohnson is aiming in the coming weeks to pass the House\u2019s budget resolution, trying to wrap all of the GOP\u2019s priorities into one massive bill.\nEven if he succeeds, Johnson\u2019s plan would then instruct committees to spend a few months pulling together all the legislation before returning to the House floor to consider the massive package.\nNone of those actions would do anything to avert<b> </b>the shutdown iceberg that is dead ahead.\nAll of this could have been handled in December, at the end of Biden\u2019s presidency, as the appropriators had a rough spending outline ready to divide up more than $1.7 trillion in agency budgets.\nBut Johnson, fearing a revolt from the far-right flank, ordered up a punt on the funding bills until March 14 so that he could secure <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/03/house-speaker-vote-live-updates/\" target=_blank>enough votes on Jan. 3 </a>for another term as speaker.\nMurray has not been shy about sending out warning flares that a real deadline is fast approaching.\n\u201cI would urge my Republican colleagues to get serious and keep your eye on the ball regarding the funding lapse on March 14,\u201d she said <a href=\"https://www.murray.senate.gov/in-senate-budget-committee-republicans-block-murray-amendments-for-bipartisan-approach-to-spending-affirming-congressional-spending-authority-reversing-nih-cuts-transparency-accountability-f/\" target=\"_blank\">during a Feb. 12 Senate Budget Committee hearing</a> on Thune\u2019s budget proposal.\nSome congressional insiders fear that a prolonged shutdown is something that Musk and the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought \u2014 whose roots come from working for the most far-right House Republicans \u2014 would cheer on. Musk, an unelected adviser with vast power, has so far not worried about the consequences of mass firings of workers in charge of air safety and those administering crucial foreign aid abroad.\nAnd this shutdown could be much more painful than the nearly five-week version during Trump\u2019s first term that started in late 2018. That shutdown partially shuttered some federal agencies, although critical entities, such as the Pentagon, already had their annual budgets approved and remained open.\nThis year, a mid-March shutdown would leave every agency without funding, keeping only those employees deemed essential at their posts. Even those key federal workers still at their jobs, such as Border Patrol agents and military troops stationed abroad, would be working without pay.\nCollins, who voted to convict Trump in the 2021 impeachment trial, indicated she opposes the Democratic bid to write binding language into the spending bills.\n\u201cWhen bills like this are done, the rule in the past has been no poison pills, no new riders,\u201d she told reporters.\nCoons doesn\u2019t even know how Democrats would write such a guarantee into legislation, given that it is already the law.\n\u201cI mean, it is demonstrably the law that when we pass an appropriations bill, and the president signs it into law, it has the force of law,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to follow it.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No. The article is primarily about Congress's inaction and potential government shutdown, discussing various political dynamics between Congress members, rather than focusing on a new action or announcement from the Trump administration.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 12:20:27"}
