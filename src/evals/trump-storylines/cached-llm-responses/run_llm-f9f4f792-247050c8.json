{"args": ["gemini-2.0-flash", "\nIs this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump moves to narrow independence of Fed, along with other Wall Street overseers\nThe Trump administration took another swing at the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence late Tuesday with a new executive order that seeks more control over federal agencies that have traditionally operated with day-to-day autonomy.\nEven as the White House executive order said it would protect the Fed\u2019s monetary policy \u2014 including its powers to set interest rates \u2014 it sought to scoop up all of Wall Street\u2019s biggest regulators and make their budgets subject to the authority of the White House budget office.\nIt\u2019s just the latest political attack on the Fed, a 111-year institution responsible for setting short-term borrowing costs that trickle through the financial sector and influence what millions of consumers and businesses pay to borrow money. It also plays a key role supervising and regulating Wall Street.\nIt\u2019s possible little of Tuesday\u2019s order will ultimately apply to the Fed because Congress established the central bank to operate with significant independence in determining how to use its resources. The order notes it does not seek to \u201cimpair\u201d any authorities Congress has given to independent agencies.\n\u201cTime, the courts and Congress will ultimately determine whether and how much of this sticks,\u201d said Scott Alvarez, a former general counsel at the Fed. \u201cWhat\u2019s important at this point is the President has announced he wants to dismantle a system of independent agencies that Congress has established and the courts have upheld and wants to shift funding decisions from Congress and the appropriations process to himself.\u201d\nLaws and norms have traditionally protected the Fed from the executive branch, with the aim of demonstrating to global markets that U.S. monetary policy isn\u2019t at the mercy of the political whims of the White House. But President Donald Trump has made clear he thinks he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/23/trump-federal-reserve/\" target=_blank>should get more of a say</a>.\nThe Fed declined to comment. A White House spokesman had no immediate comment.\nFor their part, Fed officials of their own volition have already made a series of decisions in the first weeks of the Trump administration to align internal policies with lawful directives from the White House, with the aim of avoiding a dispute with the administration, Fed watchers say.\nAlmost immediately after Trump was sworn into office, Fed officials announced a suspension of \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d programs, as well as a systemwide hiring freeze, according to emails reviewed by The Washington Post. The Fed is also trying to align to Trump\u2019s return-to-office policies, with officials considering reductions to remote work.\n\u201cAs has been our practice over many administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,\u201d Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell told reporters earlier this month.\nThe difference in the move on Tuesday is that the White House appears to be trying to force the changes on the Fed when it comes to its oversight and regulation of Wall Street. The order requires that independent agencies submit major regulations to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review.\nThe new order also states that only the president and the attorney general \u2014 \u201csubject to the President\u2019s supervision and control\u201d \u2014 will interpret law on behalf of the executive branch, blocking independent federal agencies from adopting legal interpretations that are at odds with the Trump White House.\nOMB is run by Russell Vought, a fiscal hawk who helped to craft Project 2025, a controversial policy blueprint that has informed Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Specifically, Project 2025 suggests the Fed\u2019s role should be narrowed to only keeping the money supply stable, <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-24.pdf\" target=_blank>not regulating Wall Street banks or acting as a lender of last resort when big banks fail</a>, because \u201cpolitical pressure has led the Federal Reserve to use its power to regulate banks as a way to promote politically favorable initiatives,\u201d the paper said.\nFed watchers say the central bank\u2019s actions to date suggest it wants to choose its battles carefully, avoiding conflicts with Trump that don\u2019t directly threaten its control over monetary policy. The Fed has fiercely protected its independence since the high-inflation era of the 1970s. That period was partly driven by the central bank\u2019s own missteps under pressure from President Richard M. Nixon to keep rates low, despite signs that the economy was overheating, to help his reelection campaign.\n\u201cThe Fed is willing to go all 15 rounds with the sitting president to preserve its ability to make interest-rate policy separate from the Oval Office,\u201d said Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt is not willing to separate itself from the Oval Office on nearly anything else.\u201d\n\u201cThe White House \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 appears to insist on precisely this balance of power,\u201d he added. \u201cThe question only remains whether President Trump and those closest to him will continue to regard even monetary policy as outside of his immediate control.\u201d\nFor months, Trump officials have privately discussed ways to streamline the alphabet soup of agencies responsible for overseeing Wall Street. One approach envisions consolidating agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency into a single entity, according to people familiar with the discussions granted anonymity to convey internal plans.\nLacking sufficient votes in the Senate to overhaul the financial regulatory system, the White House\u2019s order could provide a backup approach to trying to consolidate at least some control of financial regulation, even if it remains unlikely the Fed\u2019s regulatory functions wind up under the direct purview of the president. The Fed, the FDIC and the comptroller are the three primary federal banking regulators.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Fed has moved quickly to align its policies with those of a new administration. At the start of Trump\u2019s first term, the central bank similarly adopted a hiring freeze ordered across the government by the president.\nThis time, the political environment is more hostile to the Fed. During Trump\u2019s first term, some Republican senators backed Powell against repeated efforts by Trump to undermine the independence of the Fed. Most of those lawmakers are no longer in office.\nThe push for more say over the Fed comes after Michael Barr, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for banking supervision, last month said he would step down from the role at the end of this month, avoiding a potential legal fight over whether Trump had the authority to demote him.\nThe Fed\u2019s move to comply with earlier orders from the White House has been evident in the way it immediately removed public-facing webpages highlighting the board\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts following a directive from Trump that agencies cease such work.\nThe shift is notable at some regional Fed banks. At the New York Fed, officials canceled a reception scheduled for Thursday and also withdrew from a summer fellowship program that aimed to support women and underrepresented groups in economics, according to a social media post from Yana van der Meulen Rodgers, an economist at Rutgers University. A bank official attributed the cancellations to the suspension of DEI work, according to an email reviewed by The Post.\nThe New York Fed declined to comment.\nAt the Kansas City Fed, top officials told staff members on Halloween \u2014 less than a week before the presidential election \u2014 that the bank\u2019s commitment to DEI \u201cremains steadfast,\u201d according to a message to the bank\u2019s roughly 2,000 employees reviewed by The Post.\nThat contrasted sharply with a Jan. 28 message from the top two officials at each Fed bank announcing the system was \u201ctemporarily pausing\u201d diversity initiatives through at least February.\n<i>Jeff Stein contributed to this report.</i>\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 10:53:44"}
