Janet Mills (D) over transgender students.\nEarlier in the day, Trump warned during a session with the Republican Governor\u2019s Association that Maine risks losing federal funding if it continues to allow transgender students to participate in girls\u2019 sports, despite his executive order aiming to ban that.\nMills responded: \u201cWe\u2019re going to follow the law, sir. We\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\nOn Friday, the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights announced an investigation.\n\u201cMaine would have you believe that it has no choice in how it treats women and girls in athletics \u2014 that is, that it must follow its state laws and allow male athletes to compete against women and girls,\u201d Craig Trainor, the Education Department\u2019s acting assistant secretary for civil rights,<a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/office-civil-rights-launches-title-ix-violation-investigations-maine-department-of-education-and-maine-school-district\" target=_blank> said in a statement.</a> \u201cLet me be clear: If Maine wants to continue to receive federal funds from the Education Department, it has to follow Title IX.\u201d\nMills responded promptly saying the state was standing firm.\n\u201cIf the President attempts to unilaterally deprive Maine school children of the benefit of Federal funding, my Administration and the Attorney General will take all appropriate and necessary legal action to restore that funding and the academic opportunity it provides. The State of Maine will not be intimidated by the President\u2019s threats,\u201d Mills <a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-statement-presidents-threat-withhold-education-funding-maine-2025-02-21\" target=\"_blank\">replied in a statement</a>.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "Yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:06:55"}
