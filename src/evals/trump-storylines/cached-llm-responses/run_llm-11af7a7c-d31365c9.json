Mariann Budde directly addressed President Donald Trump in her plea for unity.\n\u201cIn the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country,\u201d she said to Trump at the prayer service. He sat feet away in the front row during the final official inaugural event.\nTrump told the nation Monday that he saw divine intervention in his restoration to the White House. \u201cI was saved by God to make America great again,\u201d he said, referencing the assignation attempt against him in Pennsylvania.\nAppearing to reference that statement, Budde called on Trump to help those fleeing war zones, to have mercy on children who \u201cfear that their parents will be taken away\u201d and to consider the \u201cgay, lesbian, transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families, some who fear for their lives.\u201d\nThis was not the first time Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, has directly addressed Trump\u2019s language and conduct. She was among those who in 2019, during Trump\u2019s first term, wrote a <a href=\"https://cathedral.org/about/news-media/have-we-no-decency-a-response-to-president-trump/\" target=_blank>statement</a> that read in part, \u201cAfter two years of President Trump\u2019s words and actions, when will Americans have enough?\u201d\nA year later, Budde said she was \u201coutraged\u201d when federal officers used force to clear a crowd of peaceful demonstrators from the street between the White House and St. John\u2019s Church, apparently so Trump could visit.\n\u201cEverything he has said and done is to inflame violence,\u201d Budde told The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/bishop-budde-trump-church/2020/06/01/20ca70f8-a466-11ea-b619-3f9133bbb482_story.html\" target=_blank>at the time</a>. \u201cWe need moral leadership, and he\u2019s done everything to divide us.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 14:07:41"}
