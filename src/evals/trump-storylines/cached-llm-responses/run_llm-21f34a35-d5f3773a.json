Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nYou think you like puzzles? Wait until you see this house.\nThe day Linda and Jeff Groskreutz stumbled upon a 4,600-square-foot ranch house with long empty walls in Madison Lake, Minnesota, they knew it was the one.\n\u201cIt was perfect,\u201d said Linda, explaining she was excited to finally buy a house with walls expansive enough to display the rewards of her longtime hobby: showstopping, large-scale jigsaw puzzles.\nSince the couple moved in last May, they have turned their new basement into a massive jigsaw gallery, with supersized motifs such as sailboats, fish, planets, elephants, giraffes and tropical birds.\n\nLinda, 67, said that she and Jeff moved from another nearby town in south-central Minnesota because they wanted to be near the lake. But, she added, the big walls were a great bonus.\nThe largest puzzles are showcased in plywood frames handmade by Jeff, who is supportive of his wife\u2019s time-consuming and wall-consuming habit, though he does not puzzle himself.\n\u201cLinda is really good at what she does,\u201d said Jeff, 69.\nHe\u2019s hung a total of about 115,000 pieces in eight of his separate, sprawling frames. One puzzle is so long it spills onto two adjacent walls.\nThen there\u2019s the one Jeff calls \u201cThe Granddaddy\u201d \u2014 a 40,320-piece creation emblazoned with various Disney movie themes. It weighs 44 pounds and measures more than 22 feet across and 6\u00bd feet tall.\nEach of the motifs from 10 Disney movies came in a different bag, and it took Linda 10 weeks to complete the whole thing.\n\u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t have any wall space left, so it sat on cardboard in sections for several years,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil I got a call one day from my minister.\u201d\nHer Lutheran pastor contacted her in 2021 and told her he was preparing a sermon series with a \u201cfitting together\u201d theme, and he wondered if she had a finished puzzle she could put on display at the church. Did she ever.\n\u201cI thought it would be a treat to see my Disney puzzle all together, so we took over each section of the puzzle in the truck and put it together across nine banquet tables,\u201d Linda said. \u201cIt was there for everyone to look at for more than a week.\u201d\nRecently, her puzzles have had an even bigger audience since her husband shared a quick video walk-through of their basement on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o_wVMNIhplw?si=dRqpO1GcUZKcb8fV\" target=_blank>YouTube</a>.\n\u201cThis is a little tour of what I like to call our puzzle room,\u201d Jeff begins<b> </b>in the video. \u201cThis first puzzle is 24,000 pieces. We didn\u2019t have enough wall space to put it all on one wall so we had to wrap it around the inside corner.\u201d\nHe comments that Linda was the first person in Minnesota to complete that puzzle \u2014 which she did in 2008 \u2014 with a touch of help from family and friends. She is featured on <a href=\"https://www.worldslargestpuzzle.com/hof2.html\" target=_blank>a hall-of-fame website for giant puzzle-solvers</a>, where she is quoted as saying: \u201cI look forward to the next \u2018World\u2019s Largest Puzzle\u2019 that I\u2019m sure will come out in the future. My only problem being, that I have no more walls large enough to hold any more of them, so I would have to move.\u201d\nThe next puzzle in the collection that Jeff features with his camera is a 5,000-piece puzzle of the twin towers in New York City. Linda put that one together right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Next are two animal scenes, each with 18,000 pieces. He then shows four others on the walls. Minnesota station <a href=\"https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/land-of-10000-stories/minnesotan-buys-house-to-fit-massive-jigsaw-puzzle-collection/89-60be0703-b73a-4233-9fc8-fca700a92726\" target=_blank>KARE-11</a> recently picked up on the story.\nJeff ends his video with, \u201cWell, thank you very much for coming on this little tour of mine.\u201d\nIn her new house, Linda was thrilled that the Disney puzzle fit across the entire length of one wall, with just two inches to spare.<b> </b>Some of her family members \u2014 she has two children and three grandchildren \u2014 helped lift and install the heavy puzzle.\n\u201cFinally, I have room for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is where it\u2019s going to stay.\u201d\nLinda completes a 1,000-piece puzzle in five to seven hours, she said, and she never needs a magnifying glass.\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably put together a couple thousand puzzles, but only the big ones get framed now and put up,\u201d she said.\nShe has stacks of boxed puzzles neatly piled on a pair of five-story industrial metal shelves, as well as stray jigsaw puzzles scattered on tables nearby.\nAfter she puts in the work to finish an extra large puzzle, she can\u2019t bear to take her masterpieces apart. So she covers them <a href=\"https://www.worldslargestpuzzle.com/hof-042.html\" target=_blank>with thin insulation plastic</a>, and Jeff builds the frames and hangs them \u2014 at least, the ones that fit on the walls.\n\u201cI don\u2019t sleep well, so sometimes I\u2019ll work [on a puzzle] until midnight, or I\u2019ll occasionally get up at 2 or 3 and work on one,\u201d Linda said.\nShe takes apart her favorite small puzzles and puts them back in their boxes so she can piece them together again months later. She said she is also a Sudoku puzzle fan, but adds she\u2019d rather go fishing with her husband than tackle a crossword.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always found doing puzzles relaxing, and I hope they help my brain,\u201d said Linda, pointing out that puzzles <a href=\"https://www.progresslifeline.org.uk/news/the-benefit-of-puzzles-for-the-brain\" target=_blank>help to improve short-term memory</a>.\nShe has been puzzling since she was 10 years old, growing up in rural Minnesota.\nAfter she retired from her accounting job in 2018, she said she decided to devote more time to the hobby.\n\u201cMy parents would give me and my siblings a new 1,000-piece puzzle for Christmas every year, and we\u2019d all work on it together,\u201d Linda recalled. \u201cBut what really got me going was when a relative from Germany came to visit in the late 1990s and learned that I loved puzzles.\u201d\nAs a thank-you gesture for helping him to line up motel rooms for a cross-country trip, the relative sent her a 9,000-piece Tower of Babel jigsaw made by Germany\u2019s famous <a href=\"https://www.ravensburger.com/start/index.html\" target=_blank>Ravensburger puzzle company</a>.\n\u201cThen about four years later, he sent me an 18,000-piece, tropical jungle puzzle,\u201d Linda said. \u201cIt took six months to put it together.\u201d\nTo spread her love of puzzles, she recently started a <a href=\"https://www.puzlib.com/default.php\" target=_blank>puzzle library</a> at a shopping center in nearby Mankato, where about 200 puzzles \u2014 many of them hers \u2014 are available for anyone to check out.\n\u201cIt works like an honor system \u2014 you find the puzzle you want online, then you go pick it up, put it together and bring it back,\u201d Linda said. \u201cPeople have also contributed puzzles they don\u2019t want anymore.\u201d\nShe spends about 20 hours a week piecing together her creations. Her trick is to start with the edges, then fill in the pieces by color. She advises anyone tackling a large puzzle to use a room with good lighting and sort pieces into groups based on their shapes.\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t donate a lot of my own puzzles, they\u2019d quickly take over my house,\u201d she said, guessing she has about 150 at home on her shelves.\nWhen asked by a reporter about her latest jigsaw creation, she stifled a laugh through the phone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle that shows a shelf with a bunch of spices,\u201d Linda said. \u201cI finished it while we were talking.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No - this is a news article about a couple in Minnesota and their jigsaw puzzle collection.
