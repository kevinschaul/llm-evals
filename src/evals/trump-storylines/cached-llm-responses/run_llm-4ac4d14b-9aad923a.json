{"args": ["openai/gpt-4.1-mini", "\nIs this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nJudge temporarily blocks DOGE access to sensitive information at two agencies\nA federal judge on Monday blocked Elon Musk\u2019s U.S. DOGE Service from using private information collected by<b> </b>the Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management.\nU.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman in Maryland issued a <a href=\"https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Dkt-39-Opinion-and-Order-on-TRO.pdf\">temporary restraining order</a> in a lawsuit led by the American Federation of Teachers to stop DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency,<b> </b>from accessing databases containing personal information on millions of Americans. She denied the union\u2019s request to block DOGE from sensitive Treasury Department data because a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/\">preliminary injunction</a> in a separate case achieved that goal.\nThe order bars the Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management from disclosing personally identifiable information to DOGE affiliates at least until March 10.\n\u201cThis is a significant decision that puts a firewall between actors who we believe lack the legitimacy and authority to access Americans\u2019 personal data,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers union, which represents 1.8 million workers in education, health care and government.\n\u201cWhen people give their financial and other personal information to the federal government \u2014 namely to secure financial aid for their kids to go to college, or to get a student loan \u2014 they expect that data to be protected and used for the reasons it was intended, not appropriated for other means,\u201d Weingarten added.\nThe Education Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neither did DOGE.\nThe lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated the Privacy Act by giving Musk\u2019s team sensitive data for reasons beyond its intended use. DOGE has had<b> </b>access to databases that include home addresses, Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license numbers, among other information. The union says such access poses security risks.\nIn addition to the AFT, the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They are joined by six individuals with sensitive data stored in federal systems, including military veterans who received federal student loans.\nThe Education Department collects personal information to administer federal financial aid programs. DOGE had gained access to the department\u2019s databases, including Federal Student Aid Partner Connect, the Financial Management System and the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/trump-presidency-news/#link-AFIQUVHY3BF4VHB5UF7HS57W4E\" target=_blank>National Student Loan Data System</a>.\nDOGE, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/\">previous Washington Post reporting</a>, has been<b> </b>feeding data from across the Education Department into artificial intelligence software to probe the agency\u2019s programs and spending. The effort is part of a push to slash spending and shrink the agency\u2019s staff, as President Donald Trump seeks to dismantle the<b> </b>department.\nIn the 33-page ruling, Boardman wrote that the government \u201cnever explains why\u201d OPM and department personnel need this widespread access to Americans\u2019 private information<b> </b>to carry out the overhaul.\nBoardman released the order days after a federal judge in a separate lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/18/court-declines-stop-doge-accessing-student-data/\">refused</a> to issue a restraining order to stop Musk\u2019s team from accessing student data at the Education Department, saying<b> </b>there was no immediate threat in allowing it.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:59:58"}
