{"args": ["gemini-2.0-flash-lite", "\nIs this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nTrump administration seeks more power to fire independent regulators\nThe Trump administration has told Congress it is prepared to disavow a long-standing Supreme Court ruling that has preserved the independence of certain government agencies and protected commissioners from being fired without good reason.\nThe notice to lawmakers this week is another signal that the new president intends to make it easier to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/13/trump-firings-watchdogs/\" target=_blank>purge federal government workers</a> and exert maximum control over the bureaucracy. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has fired government agency watchdogs and officials who protect whistleblowers, in addition to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/28/trump-fire-eeoc-nlrb-board-members/\" target=_blank>members of the boards of<b> </b>three independent federal agencies</a> that oversee swaths of U.S. workers, employers and labor unions.\nThe board terminations appear to violate laws that protect certain agency leaders from being fired by the president<b> </b>without cause, potentially setting up a test of the boundaries of presidential power before the Supreme Court.\nIn a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) on Wednesday, the administration outlined its legal defense of the commissioner firings and appeared to be counting on a conservative Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/supreme-court-donald-trump-test-cases-presidential-authority/\" target=_blank>to be receptive to the president\u2019s expansive views</a> of executive authority.\n\u201cThe Department of Justice has determined that certain for-cause removal provisions that apply to members of multimember regulatory commissions are unconstitutional and that the Department will no longer defend their constitutionality,\u201d acting solicitor general Sarah M. Harris wrote.\nSuch letters are<b> </b>required by Congress when the administration has decided not to defend a federal statute. It essentially put lawmakers<b> </b>on notice that<b> </b>the administration<b> </b>is willing to urge the justices to overturn the 1935 Supreme Court ruling in <i>Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. U.S.</i>, which has protected members of regulatory agencies<b> </b>such as the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe Constitution gives the president the power to remove top executive branch officials for any reason at all, but Congress passed legislation that said those officials may not be fired without cause, an attempt to ensure their independence. The Trump administration\u2019s position would give the president more control over those agencies and essentially treat their leaders more like Cabinet secretaries.\nIn response, Durbin said members of independent, bipartisan agencies such as the NLRB and FTC, which safeguard consumers and workers, have long been protected from removal at the whim of the president. The Trump administration\u2019s push to overturn a nearly century-old Supreme Court precedent, he said in a statement, is a \u201cstriking reversal of the Justice Department\u2019s long-standing position under Republican and Democratic presidents alike.\u201d\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move drew praise from conservatives such as Ed Whelan, a commentator and distinguished senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. He<b> </b>wrote in his newsletter Thursday that the administration is \u201crejecting \u2014 soundly, in my view \u2014 the notion that Congress may limit the president\u2019s ability to remove principal officers of executive-branch agencies.\u201d\nBut Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor and co-director of the school\u2019s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, said the administration\u2019s position amounted to a power grab with Trump wanting<b> </b>\u201cto get rid of anyone who is not in his thrall.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to turn the entire federal government into an episode of \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 where he screams \u2018You\u2019re fired\u2019 at everybody,\u201d she said, making a reference to the president\u2019s former<b> </b>reality TV show.\nIn late January, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/05/trump-lawsuit-nlrb-board-members-firing/\" target=_blank>Trump fired Gwynne Wilcox</a>, a Biden nominee on the NLRB whose term was set to expire in 2028. Wilcox filed a lawsuit alleging that her dismissal defied \u201cSupreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies.\u201d\nThe suit says that while Wilcox \u201chas no desire to aid the President in establishing a test case,\u201d she is also aware \u201cof the fact that, if no challenge is made, the President will have effectively succeeded in rendering\u201d invalid \u201cthe NLRB\u2019s protections \u2014 and, by extension, that of other independent agencies.\u201d\nThe NLRB \u2014 which oversees unionization votes by workers and adjudicates allegations of labor law violations \u2014 has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/21/musk-trump-nlrb-amazon-spacex/\" target=_blank>faced a flurry of legal challenges</a> to its constitutionality over the past year, including by SpaceX and Amazon (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post). Workers are already being affected by Wilcox\u2019s firing, including a group of Philadelphia Whole Foods employees who voted to unionize the same day she was removed.\nWhole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, objected to the union\u2019s win on the grounds that, without Wilcox, the National Labor Relations Board lacks a quorum and therefore doesn\u2019t have the authority to certify the election result. Legal experts said the argument is invalid.\nIn <i>Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. U.S.</i>, the Supreme Court said Congress could stop the president from firing without good reason a member of the Federal Trade Commission. Specifically, the high court said President Franklin D. Roosevelt could not remove one of the FTC commissioners because of their political differences.\nEver since the Reagan administration, the conservative legal movement has advocated a robust view of presidential power known as the \u201cunitary executive theory\u201d in which the president controls all executive decisions without restraint from Congress. The theory played a role in 2020, when the court ruled 5-4 that the structure of another independent watchdog agency was unconstitutional and that the president could fire without cause the director of the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-7_n6io.pdf\" target=_blank>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>.\nThat decision did not overrule the directive in <i>Humphrey\u2019s Executor </i>that Congress can restrict the president\u2019s power to fire officials at \u201cmultimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power.\u201d\nBut Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote separately to call for the ruling to be overturned, saying the precedent<b> </b>\u201cposes a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people.\u201d\nIt is not clear<b> </b>how many of the<b> </b>other justices would agree with Thomas and Gorsuch if given the opportunity in a future case.<b> </b>The court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority, with three justices nominated by Trump, last year overturned<b> </b>another long-standing ruling targeted by conservatives<b> </b>that required judges to defer to the reasonable interpretations of agency experts.\nGillian E. Metzger, a Columbia Law School professor who was deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel during the Biden administration, said recent rulings have created openings for presidents<b> </b>to try to increase their authority over agencies.\nThe Trump administration is \u201cpushing to see how far they can get those to go,\u201d she added, calling the departure from precedent that was signaled in the solicitor general\u2019s letter part of a \u201cvery broad effort to hobble and denigrate core institutions of the federal government.\u201d\nIn her letter to Congress, Harris mentioned three independent, multimember regulator agencies whose commissioners \u201cexercise substantial executive power\u201d: the National Labor Relations Board, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. She<b> </b>said the Supreme Court\u2019s 1935 ruling \u201cprevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the Executive Branch who execute the laws on the President\u2019s behalf.\u201d\nBut the same rationale could apply to other agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. The Supreme Court, legal experts said, may be wary about calling into question the structure of the Federal Reserve, in particular, because of the potential destabilizing effects on monetary policy.\n\u201cWhere would they draw the line?\u201d asked Patrick Schmidt, a political science professor and co-director of legal studies at Macalester College.\n<i>Caroline O\u2019Donovan contributed to this report.</i>\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:31:36"}
