The Defense Department disclosed the deployment Monday, after the White House posted Sunday morning that the Marines had begun arriving.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is due to travel to the southern U.S. border Monday, has said the Guant\u00e1namo facility will be useful to house migrants whose home country is not immediately assisting with return. They would be detained on a separate part of the base from where militants and terrorism suspects have long been held.\nThe Trump administration has said that up to 30,000 migrants could be held at Guant\u00e1namo. Migrants have been held there in the past, but in much smaller numbers.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "yes", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:28:51"}
