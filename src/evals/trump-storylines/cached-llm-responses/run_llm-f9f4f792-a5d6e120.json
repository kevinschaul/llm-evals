But Jordan counts on significant annual aid from the United States and Abdullah politely sat alongside Trump as the latter reminded the world of the possibility of that assistance being shut off. After their meeting, the Jordanian king issued a statement rejecting Palestinian \u201cdisplacement.\u201d Arab officials are putting together a different proposal for the administration and reconstruction of Gaza that will allow its population to remain.\nThe next day, Trump startled allies in Europe with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/12/trump-putin-talks-ukraine-war/\" target=_blank>a call to Putin</a>. The overture broke years of silence between the White House and the Kremlin, and preceded news of a potential U.S.-Russia summit facilitated by Saudi Arabia \u2014 raising the possibility of a deal hatched without either Ukrainians or any other<b> </b>Europeans at the table. In subsequent comments, Trump insisted his transatlantic interlocutors would not be sidelined, but also added that he wanted Russia back in diplomatic formats like the Group of Seven nations (no longer the Group of Eight since Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014).\nEuropean officials feared Trump and his lieutenants, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was in meetings on the continent, were openly giving away concessions to the Kremlin before meaningful negotiations. Both Hegseth and Trump have all but rejected the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, while the former said Ukraine would not realistically regain much of its territory lost to Russia.\n<b>Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-fledged invasion in 2022 has been locked in an existential fight for survival. </b>Kyiv won\u2019t accept foreign powers forcing concessions on it and is wary of Trump reducing Ukraine\u2019s leverage in a hypothetical deal with Russia.\n\u201cYour politicians have lost their dignity,\u201d a Ukrainian military officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/trump-putin-call-europe-ukraine-reaction/\" target=_blank>told my colleagues</a>. \u201cUkraine\u2019s betrayal after Afghanistan will have catastrophic consequences for America\u2019s perception in the world,\u201d he said, referring to the Taliban takeover that came after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nTrump doesn\u2019t seem worried about such perceptions, and has cast himself as an unorthodox peacemaker willing to have discussions and create solutions others could not. He also seems squishy on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, suggesting that the country\u2019s wealth of critical minerals should be reserved for the United States in exchange for security guarantees. In a TV interview earlier this week, he said there was a chance that Ukraine \u201cmay be Russian someday.\u201d At a White House presser Thursday evening, Trump didn\u2019t answer a journalist\u2019s question about what concessions Russia should itself make in a peace deal, but reiterated his opposition to Ukraine joining NATO.\nThe language coming out of Washington has frustrated officials in Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s appeasement. It has never worked,\u201d E.U. foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. \u201cIt is clear that any deal behind our backs will not work. Any agreement will need also Ukraine and Europe being part of it.\u201d\n\u201cTrump always speaks about \u2018peace through strength,\u2019 and that is precisely the right approach with the Russians,\u201d a senior European official <a href=\"https://archive.is/BP5sR#selection-5883.110-5887.204\" target=_blank>told the Wall Street Journal</a>. \u201cBut here we have not really seen the strength part yet.\u201d\n<b>When it comes to Gaza, Trump is even more dismissive</b>. He believes the United States would simply assume responsibility for the territory, a \u201cdemolition site,\u201d and make it into the \u201cRiviera\u201d of the Middle East, no matter the expulsion of its inhabitants. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take it, we\u2019re going to hold it, we\u2019re going to cherish it,\u201d Trump said of Gaza, while scoffing at any question of paying for it \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to buy,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ABCNews/videos/were-gonna-have-gaza-theres-nothing-to-buypres-trump-doubled-down-on-his-plan-fo/629356416166279/\" target=\"_blank\">he told reporters</a>.\nPalestinians do not see their homeland as \u201cnothing.\u201d Even amid the devastation of their homes, Gaza\u2019s traumatized population does not want to lose its rights to the land. Tensions are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/09/trump-gaza-development-intervention/\" target=_blank>fraying the fragile ceasefire</a> between Israel and militant group Hamas, raising the prospect of a resumption of Israel\u2019s bombardments that have already flattened most of the territory\u2019s civilian infrastructure and killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.\n\u201cPalestinians do not need President Trump to talk about Gaza as if it were an empty hotel room that needs redesigning,\u201d wrote Mosab Abu Toha, a Palestinian poet from Gaza, <a href=\"https://archive.is/IKTeP#selection-635.0-635.117\" target=\"_blank\">in the New Yorker</a>. He pointed to the vast humanitarian need in the territory \u2014 assistance which Israel, despite ceasefire commitments, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-says-aid-flows-into-gaza-have-risen-since-ceasefire-including-shelter-items-2025-02-11/\" target=\"_blank\">may still be restricting</a> \u2014 and the urgent need to start clearing tons of debris. \u201cThe people who shape this future need to be us Palestinians,\u201d he added, \u201cnot the people who made Gaza look like a demolition site, or who now seem to think that an entire people should be demolished, too.\u201d\nDiplomats across the Arab world have echoed this position, as have European politicians and U.N. officials. \u201cIt\u2019s strange at the moment to be in a period when statecraft seems to have been replaced by real estate craft,\u201d Tom Fletcher, the United Nations undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, said of Trump\u2019s plan in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/09/trump-gaza-development-intervention/\" target=_blank>an interview Sunday after a tour of Gaza</a>. \u201cI was asking a lot of people what they thought, and every single one of them said, \u2018We\u2019re not going anywhere. We\u2019ll rebuild our homes again and again and again as we always have done.\u2019\u201d\n<b>Trump\u2019s plans for Gaza are not just about the fancies of a real estate tycoon. </b>His apparent belief that Gaza can be emptied of its population is celebrated by the Israeli right, as prominent politicians have for months <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/05/wv-israel-hamas/\" target=\"_blank\">eyed the occupation and settlement</a> of Gaza, as well as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/25/israel-ethnic-cleansing-gaza-settlements/\" target=\"_blank\">the expulsion of its Palestinian inhabitants</a>. It \u201crewards the policies of the Israel government that is the most extremist, right-wing in the history of the Israeli state,\u201d Aaron David Miller, a veteran former U.S. diplomat who worked for decades on Israeli-Palestinian issues, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/09/trump-gaza-development-intervention/\" target=\"_blank\">told my colleague Karen DeYoung</a>.\nAnd if the political aspirations of Palestinians are irrelevant to Trump, so too are the political anxieties of Ukrainians \u2014 much to the pleasure of those in the Kremlin\u2019s inner circle. \u201cWe are entering a new 21st century, and it\u2019s not going to look like the 20th,\u201d Konstantin Malofeyev, a Russian tycoon who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions for<b> </b>his role financing pro-Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/trump-russia-ukraine-territory-peace-deal/\" target=_blank>told my colleagues</a>. \u201cWe are returning to the era of traditional big states, great powers and to a balance of interests.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "no", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 10:57:16"}
