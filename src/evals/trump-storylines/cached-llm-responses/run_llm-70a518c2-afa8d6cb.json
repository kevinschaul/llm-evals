After winning the November election, he threatened to put new fees on imported goods from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. But that did not happen Monday, and Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/21/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada/\" target=_blank>has since suggested</a> he will issue those tariffs Feb. 1.\nTrump\u2019s posture toward Russia has been especially notable since he returned to the White House. Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-ukraine.html\" target=_blank>issued an unusual critique</a> of the country\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, on Monday, saying he is \u201cdestroying Russia\u201d by not making an agreement to end the war.\nRussian imports to the United States have plummeted amid major U.S. sanctions on Russia over the war. One of President Joe Biden\u2019s last moves in office was to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/10/russia-oil-sanctions-shadow-ships-biden/\" target=_blank>blacklist two of Russia\u2019s largest oil producers</a> and nearly 200 tanker ships.\nAsked Tuesday whether he would put additional sanctions on Russia if Putin does not stop the war, Trump said it \u201csounds likely.\u201d\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:57:21"}
