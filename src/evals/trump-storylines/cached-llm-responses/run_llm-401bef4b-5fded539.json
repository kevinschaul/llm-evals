Thanks for waking up with us.\n<b>In today\u2019s edition</b> \u2026 Elon Musk joins Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting \u2026 Donalds announces Florida gubernatorial campaign \u2026 but first \u2026\nDemocrats vow political consequences amid House budget drama\nHouse Republicans weathered a nail-biter of a vote last night and passed a budget blueprint that lets them get down to work on President <b>Donald Trump</b>\u2019s agenda.\nIt was not without political danger \u2014 to put it mildly.\n\u201cWe just won back the House,\u201d Rep. <b>Haley Stevens</b> (D-Michigan) said as she walked off the floor.\nIn approving the budget resolution with only one defector \u2014 Rep. <b>Thomas Massie</b> (R-Kentucky) \u2014 House Speaker <b>Mike Johnson </b>(R-Louisiana) was able to assuage the concerns of more moderate Republicans that the proposal laid the groundwork for devastating cuts to Medicaid and other programs.\nBut even days before the 217 to 215 vote, the political peril was becoming evident for House Republicans. Nearly half the federal spending cuts proposed in the resolution would come through the House committee that oversees Medicaid, and Democrats argued that cuts to the program were all but inevitable.\nDemocratic-aligned groups released reams of polling and data on Medicaid, breaking it down by congressional district in some cases.\nThe Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, <a href=\"https://www.americanprogressaction.org/article/these-15-congressional-districts-would-see-large-medicaid-funding-losses-under-republican-house-budget-resolution/\" target=\"_blank\">released a list of 15 GOP-held districts</a> that it said would see \u201clarge\u201d Medicaid losses if the House Energy and Commerce Committee fully cut from Medicaid under the budget blueprint. Many of those districts are represented by some of the most vulnerable House Republicans.\nThe pushback illustrated Democratic confidence that even though the midterms are well over a year away, messing with Medicaid could be politically fatal for the GOP.\nIn a memo released Monday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee argued that vulnerable House Republicans would be \u201csealing their political fate\u201d by supporting the budget resolution. The DCCC reiterated the sentiment after the vote, saying in a statement on Republicans\u2019 support for the resolution that \u201cno amount of their desperate lies will save them from the political fallout of this vote.\u201d\nSome House Republicans in competitive districts raced to explain their vote within minutes of the resolution\u2019s approval.\n\u201cThe Budget Resolution passed today does not specify any cuts to federal programs,\u201d Rep. <b>Ken Calvert</b> (R-California) said in a statement, without mentioning Medicaid by name. \u201cI want to make it clear that I do not support cuts to Social Security, Medicare and the safety net programs our vulnerable Americans rely on.\u201d\nThe House GOP campaign arm went on offense after the vote by focusing on how the resolution sets the stage for the extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts. The National Republican Congressional Committee argued that vulnerable House Democrats had just voted to \u201craise taxes on MILLIONS of American families and small businesses.\u201d\nBut it was House GOP leaders who spent yesterday trying to unify their conference behind the budget resolution, looking to quash reservations \u2014 or outright opposition \u2014 from the center and the right.\n\u201cThe word \u2018Medicaid\u2019 is not even in this bill,\u201d House Majority Leader <b>Steve Scalise</b> (R-Louisiana) said yesterday at a news conference, holding up the budget resolution and pointing at it. \u201cThis bill doesn\u2019t even mention the word \u2018Medicaid\u2019 a single time, and yet all Democrats are doing is lying about what\u2019s in the budget because they don\u2019t want to talk about the truth of what we\u2019re voting to start. We\u2019re voting to start a process. This doesn\u2019t end the process.\u201d\n\u201cClearly we\u2019ve hit a nerve,\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chairman <b>Pete Aguilar</b> (California) told reporters a short time later.\nPrivately, many House Republicans tell our colleague <b>Marianna Sotomayor</b> that drafting policies to match the strict spending levels will result in cuts and that Democrats are not \u201cfearmongering,\u201d as GOP leaders alleged yesterday, that cuts would affect social benefits such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\nRep. <b>Juan Ciscomani </b>(R-Arizona), who was part of a group of Hispanic Republicans that had raised concerns about potential Medicaid cuts, told reporters hours before the vote that GOP leaders were hearing him out.\n\u201cThe Hispanic community, along with the rest of the country, trusted us with this mandate,\u201d Ciscomani said, \u201cand they want us to rein in the government spending, and they also want to make sure that their loved ones are protected with health insurance.\u201d\nAnother vulnerable House Republican \u2014 Rep. <b>Michael Lawler</b> (New York) \u2014 echoed Scalise hours before the vote.\n\u201cThe budget resolution is simply about unlocking the ability to negotiate a bill,\u201d Lawler told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s ultimately what today is about. The Democrats will try to make it about all sorts of things, but show me where in the budget resolution it talks about specific cuts. It doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s early in the cycle, some of the Democratic challengers who have already launched campaigns against vulnerable House Republicans released statements yesterday adding to the pressure on them. One of those challengers was <b>Rebecca Bennett</b>, a former Navy helicopter pilot who\u2019s running against Rep. <b>Tom Kean Jr. </b>(R-New Jersey).\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Congressman Kean to show residents of the 7th District where he stands on this critical issue \u2014 will he vote to protect the health care of thousands of families and children?\u201d Bennett said in a statement. \u201cThat should be an easy decision.\u201d\nKean\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nWhat\u2019s next? The House and Senate have passed different proposals to craft Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d so both sides must deconflict and pass the same budget resolution to start putting policy to paper.\nAt the White House\nElon Musk joins Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting\nTrump is set to hold his first Cabinet meeting today with<b> </b>a special guest: <b>Elon Musk</b>.\nWhite House press secretary <b>Karoline Leavitt </b>told reporters yesterday that Musk, head of the U.S. DOGE Service, will attend the meeting to \u201ctalk about DOGE\u2019s efforts and how all of the Cabinet secretaries are identifying waste, fraud and abuse in their respective agencies.\u201d\nIt will serve as another reminder of the extraordinary \u2014 and controversial \u2014 role that Musk is playing in the Trump administration. And it will come after some Cabinet secretaries urged their employees not to respond to a recent email from Musk telling them to share what they worked on in the past week.\nLeavitt said Trump respected the decisions of those Cabinet secretaries but downplayed any tensions. Trump, Musk and the secretaries are \u201cworking as one team,\u201d she said.\nWhat we\u2019re watching\nTrump\nTrump is set to hold the Cabinet meeting at 11 a.m. in the Cabinet Room. At 3 p.m., he is scheduled to sign executive orders in the Oval Office.\nCongress\nThe House and Senate are scheduled to come in at 10 a.m.\nThe Senate is set to continue considering Trump\u2019s nomination of <b>Jamieson Greer</b> to be U.S. trade representative.\nAt 10:15 a.m., the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold a confirmation hearing for three Trump nominees to the Justice Department: <b>D. John Sauer</b> to be solicitor general, as well as <b>Harmeet Dhillon</b> and <b>Aaron Reitz</b> to be assistant attorneys general.\nThe campaign\nDonalds announces Florida gubernatorial campaign\nRep. <b>Byron Donalds</b> (R-Florida) made it official last night: He\u2019s running for Florida governor.\nHe announced the move on Fox News days after Trump endorsed him, instantly making him a formidable candidate to succeed term-limited Gov. <b>Ron DeSantis</b> (R) in the 2026 election.\nDeSantis made clear Monday he is not on board with Donalds, criticizing him as absent from recent conservative victories in Florida. DeSantis also talked up his wife, <b>Casey DeSantis</b>, as a possible gubernatorial candidate.\nAsked about her potential candidacy on Fox, Donalds said it\u2019s \u201cvery early\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d \u2014 but he was quick to emphasize he has Trump\u2019s endorsement. As for Ron DeSantis, Donalds said the governor has done \u201ca tremendous job\u201d and then offered an implicit response to DeSantis\u2019s recent criticism.\n\u201cFor a long time, I\u2019ve been in the trenches of a lot of these battles dealing with conservatism,\u201d Donalds said, referring to his time as a state legislator.\nPoll Watch\nVirginia gubernatorial poll shows unsettled contest\nA poll shows that one of the marquee elections of the year \u2014 the Virginia governor\u2019s race \u2014 is far from settled. The <a href=\"https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_february_2025\" target=_blank>survey from Roanoke College</a> found that nearly a third of voters \u2014 32 percent \u2014 were undecided in a hypothetical November matchup between Democrat <b>Abigail Spanberger</b> and Republican <b>Winsome Earle-Sears</b>. Spanberger, a<b> </b>former Virginia congresswoman, received the support of 39 percent of voters, while Earle-Sears, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, garnered 24 percent. Each is the front-runner for her party\u2019s nomination in the June primaries.\nThe Media\n<b>Must reads:</b>\n<b>From The Post:</b>\n<b>From across the web:</b>\nViral\n<b>If you have to ask \u2026</b>\nThanks for reading.
