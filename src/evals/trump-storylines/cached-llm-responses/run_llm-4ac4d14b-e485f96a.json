Mayor Eric Adams pushes for permanent dismissal of his corruption case\nNEW YORK \u2014 Mayor Eric Adams\u2019s attorney argued Wednesday that the case against him should be dismissed permanently, alleging that leaks of a former top prosecutor\u2019s resignation letter discussing the indictment prevented any future fair trial.\nThe motion filed by Adams lawyer Alex Spiro argued that the mayor\u2019s right to a fair trial was tainted by former acting U.S. attorney Danielle Sassoon\u2019s leaked Feb. 12 letter that said the case was strong and that her office was prepared to file additional charges for obstruction.\nSassoon also said she believed a quid pro quo existed between a top figure at the Justice Department and Adams, and that the mayor committed to help with President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration efforts in exchange for seeing his case dismissed.\nAdams and the Justice Department have denied a quid quo pro exists, but the ordeal and the government\u2019s decision to abandon the public corruption matter have drawn an immense amount of controversy.\nActing deputy attorney general Emil Bove argued in court last week without offering proof that the case was politically motivated and would interfere with the 2025 mayoral election. Bove asked Judge Dale Ho to dismiss the case \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d which would leave open a possible future revival of the matter.\nSpiro argued in his letter to Ho on Wednesday that the case should be dismissed \u201cwith prejudice\u201d instead, because \u201cthe government\u2019s conduct has destroyed whatever presumption of innocence Mayor Adams had left.\u201d\nHo cannot ultimately deny Bove\u2019s request, but he did not immediately toss the case. He instead assigned an independent lawyer to evaluate arguments against the government\u2019s dismissal request.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 13:57:59"}
