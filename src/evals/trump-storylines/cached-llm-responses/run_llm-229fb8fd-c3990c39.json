Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nRepublican satisfaction in democracy increases to 33 percent\nMore Republicans are more satisfied with the way democracy is working in the United States than they were a year ago, when dissatisfaction was at an all-time low, according to a poll released Wednesday.\nThe December Gallup poll found a similar share of Democrats, Republicans and independents said they were satisfied with the way U.S. democracy is working. Thirty-three percent of Republicans said they were satisfied (nearly double the share last year), along with 35 percent of Democrats and 34 percent of independents.\nGallup attributed the increased satisfaction among Republicans to Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the November presidential election.\nHowever, while Republicans are more upbeat about democracy, the nation\u2019s overall sentiment has declined in recent decades to 34 percent today and remains low compared to the 1980s and 1990s. Satisfaction with U.S. democracy reached a record high of 61 percent in 1984.\nAmericans\u2019 satisfaction with democracy today matches what it was in January 2021, shortly after Trump contested the results of the 2020 election, which led to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 09:34:55"}
