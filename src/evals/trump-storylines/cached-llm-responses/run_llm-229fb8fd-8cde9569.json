{"args": ["llama-3.2-3b-4bit", "\nDoes this describe a specific, new, official action or formal announcement already taken/made by the Trump administration? Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nJudge says Trump officials have not complied with order to restart foreign aid\nA federal judge in D.C. on Thursday told the Trump administration it had failed to comply with his order to restart billions in foreign aid but stopped short of holding officials in contempt of court as plaintiffs in a pair of lawsuits had asked.\nEarlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Amir H. Ali issued a temporary restraining order blocking the administration from putting a 90-day pause on foreign assistance. In Thursday\u2019s ruling, he said the order \u201cwas clear,\u201d but Trump officials had not followed it.\nPresident Donald Trump placed the aid on hold as one of his first actions after taking office in January, saying the aid did not align with American interests or values.\nHealth organizations filed suit in response, claiming the Trump administration was endangering the lives of many around the world who relied on the assistance to combat HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. The money also went to other development projects.\nAfter Ali issued his temporary restraining order, or TRO, requiring Trump officials to restart the aid on Feb. 13, the administration said it had authority under other statutes to continue much of the freeze. Ali rejected that idea Thursday.\n\u201cThe TRO does not permit Defendants to simply search for and invoke new legal authorities as a post-hoc rationalization for the enjoined agency action,\u201d Ali wrote.\n"], "kwargs": {}, "result": "No.", "cached_at": "2025-04-17 09:50:15"}
