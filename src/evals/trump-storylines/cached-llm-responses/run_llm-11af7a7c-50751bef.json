{"args": ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "\nDoes this describe a specific, new, official action or formal announcement already taken/made by the Trump administration? Answer only \"yes\" or \"no\".\nGOP lawmakers scramble to protect foreign aid as food relief languishes\nAs GOP lawmakers in Washington try to protect a key food aid program from the Trump administration\u2019s cutbacks, international humanitarian organizations say the ongoing disruptions<b> </b>in assistance are devastating countries that are on the verge of famine.\nThe administration\u2019s move in late January to gut the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/01/foreign-aid-freeze-state-department-usaid/\" target=_blank>laying off thousands of workers</a> and freezing funding<b> </b>in more than 100 countries \u2014 immediately jeopardized Food for Peace. For more than 70 years, the $2 billion program has purchased surplus commodities from American farmers for distribution overseas.\nLate Thursday, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered administration officials to temporarily lift their freeze on U.S. aid and development programs abroad. He alluded to the \u201cshockwave\u201d caused by their action and said they \u201chave not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid \u2026 was a rational precursor to reviewing programs.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump and top adviser Elon Musk, a tech billionaire, have been highly critical of USAID\u2019s work, with Trump baselessly claiming the agency had committed \u201ctremendous fraud.\u201d \nDespite a State Department waiver for emergency food assistance, those shipments still had been delayed around the world, a USAID inspector general wrote in a report Monday \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/11/trump-fires-usaid-inspector-general/\" target=_blank>a day before he was dismissed</a>. The bottleneck, Paul K. Martin wrote, put more than $489 million in food assistance at risk of spoilage or theft as it waited at ports, in transit and in warehouses.\nIn defending itself in court, Ali noted, the government acknowledged that the waiver process \u201cmay have had \u2018hiccups.\u2019\u201d\nAid groups had said Thursday that some food deliveries were starting to move through shipping channels but that millions more pounds of corn, lentils and pinto beans remained stuck because the agency\u2019s payment system was not functioning.\nThe waiver for lifesaving assistance that was in place before the judge\u2019s order was \u201ctheoretical\u201d because \u201cthe payment system that reimburses partners for expenses they incur is offline,\u201d said Sarah Charles, former head of USAID\u2019s Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, which oversaw the Food for Peace program. Some relief agencies are still owed for services rendered in December and January, she added.\nAt a contentious meeting at the State Department, the Trump appointee tasked with overseeing USAID \u2014 or what is left of it \u2014 had assured aid workers and congressional staff that aid payments would resume early next week. But Peter Marocco also said that a department review of the agency\u2019s remaining projects was underway and that those that do not \u201cgive the president real influence\u201d will be cut, according to a readout of the event obtained by The Washington Post.\nA department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\nComplicating the administration\u2019s narrative is a growing tide of Republican lawmakers and former officials who say it\u2019s not quite accurate.\nAndrew Natsios, who served as USAID administrator during the George W. Bush administration, told lawmakers this week that even those relief organizations already granted waivers haven\u2019t been able to \u201cissue checks\u201d and keep working because of the shutdown of USAID\u2019s payment system.\nThat includes Christian humanitarian groups, which receive $1 billion a year, Natsios said at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing<b> </b>Thursday. The session was meant to highlight what Trump and his allies say is USAID\u2019s wasteful spending but instead underscored concerns about the flow of critical assistance, as two of the three expert witnesses warned of dire consequences for U.S. interests and national security if the aid did not resume soon.\nSen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), who has urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \u201cquickly ship and distribute\u201d the American-grown food assistance, is among those questioning what\u2019s happening on the ground.\nMoran said the State Department last weekend had notified participating groups that they could restart operations. He is skeptical that there has been much impact so far. \u201cMy impression is that waivers were granted, but then it doesn\u2019t seem like it was making a significant difference,\u201d he told The Post.\n\nHe is working with Rep. Tracey Mann (R), a fellow Kansan, and other lawmakers to protect Food for Peace by moving it to the U.S. Department of Agriculture as \u201cpart of an ongoing effort to save money and increase efficiency,\u201d Moran said in a statement. That proposal has gained widespread support from agricultural groups.\nFounded in Kansas, Food for Peace was signed into law in 1954 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It has long been championed by the state\u2019s leaders, including former senator Robert J. Dole, and has helped more than 4 billion people in over 150 countries since its inception.\nThe program is a source of pride for farmers. But it has been criticized over the years for various issues, including the potential to undermine local agriculture in recipient countries and exacerbate conflicts in war-torn areas, according to Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute.\nEven if the lawmakers prevail, the program\u2019s ultimate survival is not guaranteed.\nNick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, pointed to the USDA\u2019s new secretary. Brooke Rollins, former head of a conservative Texas think tank, was confirmed Thursday.\n\u201cWhat happens if she goes into this office cleaning house?\u201d Levendofsky asked. \u201cAnd what about when Elon Musk comes over to USDA? Anything is to be expected at this point.\u201d\nKansas is the country\u2019s biggest grower of sorghum, and millions of bushels of the high-protein grain are backed up in warehouses across the state. Kim Barnes, chief financial officer of the Pawnee County Cooperative Association, a grain trader in central Kansas, said he\u2019s storing more than 1.3 million bushels of sorghum because of a market downturn over the last year \u2014 a situation that will only worsen with USAID cutbacks.\nIt\u2019s a shame, he said, adding: \u201cThere are still countries that need it.\u201d\nOn Thursday, a different federal judge <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/13/usaid-workers-trump-leave-ruling/\" target=_blank>extended a block</a> on the Trump administration\u2019s plan to place thousands of USAID employees on leave. But with thousands of contractors already<i><b> </b></i>fired, the agency\u2019s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance could ultimately lose more than 90 percent of its workforce, Martin, the inspector general, wrote. That outcome exacerbates concerns about whether any existing staff can work with locals on the ground to distribute the commodities, he added.\nThe <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">temporary gap in supplies has been \u201cdevastating\u201d</a> some countries, said Paul Spiegel, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health and former chief of public health in the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\u201cThere has already been much damage done that will be difficult to undo,\u201d Spiegel said Friday. \u201cThe administration has not always done what they said they would do providing exceptions for humanitarian response, so the question remains: Will they allow funds to go out, or will they simply slow it down and the pain and suffering of all these vulnerable people around the globe will continue?\u201d\nDuaa Tarig, who worked as an art curator in Sudan before war broke out, said she personally knew three people who recently died of malnutrition in her Khartoum neighborhood.\nThe pattern is familiar. During a 10-day period last year, many died when soup kitchens in the city were forced to shutter for lack of funding, she recounted. Weakened by starvation, individuals succumbed quickly to malaria or dengue fever.\nWith USAID funding curtailed, more than 80 percent of those soup kitchens have closed again, she said. Many of those remaining open are unable to afford the lentils they usually buy and are scraping together vegetable soups.\n\u201cEveryone, including myself, have lost a lot of weight. Some have lost more than half their body weight. I see the faces of people I used to know and I can\u2019t recognize them \u2014 they are just bone and skin,\u201d she said.\n<i>Houreld reported from Nairobi.
