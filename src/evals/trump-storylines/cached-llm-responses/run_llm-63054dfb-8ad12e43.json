{"args": ["gemini-2.0-flash-lite", "\nIs this article primarily about a new action or announcement by the Trump administration/White House/Executive? Respond simply with \"yes\" or \"no\" .\nSeveral administration officials tell workers not to reply to Musk email\nElon Musk\u2019s demand that all 2.3 million government workers<b> </b>justify their work prompted confusion and resistance on Sunday, as several government agency leaders told their staffs not to reply to a mass email requesting bullet-point summations of their accomplishments.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard instructed personnel in U.S. spy agencies not to respond, according to the text of an email she sent to the workforce on Sunday, citing the agencies\u2019 sensitive and classified work. Defense Department employees were given similar instructions to not respond, as were FBI personnel<b> </b>and Department of Homeland Security employees.\nThe latest directives<b> </b>come as employees and leaders alike across the government were caught off guard by an email sent Saturday titled: \u201cWhat did you do last week?\u201d\nIt commanded federal employees to \u201creply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,\u201d according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. It gave employees a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time Monday.\nThe email left many worried, others defiant and still others stunned. The resistance, which grew throughout the weekend, came even from some top administration officials selected by President Donald Trump.\nEmployees at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency were told definitively to reply \u2014 a few hours before DHS sent a note saying the opposite. In some parts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, staffers received instructions to draft a response but not send it yet. At other agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, employees were first given one instruction only to be emailed later to pause and watch for more guidance Monday.\nRaising the stakes, Musk warned in a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893386883444437415\">post on X</a> that any employee who failed to respond would be treated as having resigned. But the email sent to workers made no mention of that possible consequence, which lawyers said would be illegal.\nMusk\u2019s threat also appears to contradict an <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/media/kfpozkad/gwes-pia.pdf\" target=_blank>assessment released on Feb. 5</a> by the Office of Personnel Management that concluded that any responses to government-wide emails must be \u201cexplicitly voluntary.\u201d Yet the weekend email was sent by an address at OPM, which serves as human resources for the entire federal government \u2014 and has been largely taken over by Musk\u2019s U.S. DOGE Service.\nOn Sunday, a Republican lawmaker questioned the viability of the directive.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how that\u2019s necessarily feasible,\u201d Rep. Michael Lawler (New York) said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cObviously, a lot of federal employees are under union contract.\u201d\nMany employees at certain agencies cannot disclose information about their work to third parties without explicit authorization, security experts noted. Some warned of security risks if all 2.3 million federal employees are forced to reply to one email server sharing their contact information, their manager\u2019s contact information and details about the work they do.\nWorries at intelligence agencies\nConcerns ran especially deep among employees of the Defense Department, intelligence agencies and the military, according to messages and interviews with more than 300 federal employees.\n\u201cEven if people don\u2019t send classified information, the aggregation of all this information in one place would become classified information, which is a national security violation,\u201d warned one active-duty military officer who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. \u201cThe military cannot function without the DOD federal workforce. This is a national security issue to treat the workforce this way.\u201d\nAt the Justice Department, managers were advised late Saturday evening that all employees should be prepared to submit responses to the email on Monday. But rank-and-file FBI employees and staff in at least three U.S. attorney\u2019s offices across the country said Sunday that the last guidance they received from their direct managers was not to reply to the email before receiving further instructions.\nIn a bureau-wide communication Saturday evening, newly installed FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI would \u201cconduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures.\u201d\nAt the Secret Service, the OPM email prompted a flurry of texts and emails to supervisors among agents and officers about whether they were expected to reveal the sensitive and classified details of their job duties the previous week, according to two people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal communications.\nTo prevent agents from having to describe classified tasks they perform to protect the president and other high-ranking officials, senior officials initially instructed their subordinate agents to send an example response, beginning with: \u201cThis week I accomplished: 100% of the tasks and duties required of me by my position description\u201d and \u201c100% of the work product that my manager and I have agreed to.\u201d\nThe fifth and final bullet said: \u201cI exceeded expectations in the delivery of the above.\u201d\nOn online forums, many employees cheered the boilerplate language, before DHS told staff early Sunday evening that no one should respond, including those in component offices such as the Secret Service.\n\nAt the State Department, Tibor P. Nagy, acting undersecretary of state for management, said in a message obtained by The Post the department \u201cwill respond on behalf of the Department,\u201d adding that \u201cno employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command.\u201d\nSimilar messages went out to employees at a division within the Air Force, the Defense Information Systems Agency and the National Science Foundation, where the chief management officer said in a note to employees that the NSF did not receive advanced notice or guidance about the email.\nMusk stands firm, as directive costs workers time\nOn Saturday night and throughout Sunday, Musk doubled down on the directive. On X, the social media platform he owns, he stated that the email was necessary to ferret out government employees who are \u201cdoing so little work that they are not checking their email.\u201d He claimed, without evidence, that there were \u201cnon-existent people or the identities of dead people\u201d pretending to be government workers. Many Republican lawmakers defended the message, arguing it would only take a few minutes to reply.\nBut it caused uncertainty \u2014 and ate up people\u2019s time across the government. In the Air Force department, for example, some supervisors spent their Sundays phoning or texting each one of their subordinates to ensure they had seen both Musk\u2019s email and later guidance saying not to reply to it, according to several employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\nThe chaos extended beyond the executive branch. At the Library of Congress, which is part of the separate legislative branch, staff received an email Sunday afternoon saying the OPM note was not meant for them and they should not respond.\nSome judges and judiciary staff, who are also not in the executive branch, also received the OPM email, according to a note obtained by The Post from the director\u2019s office of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which staffs the judiciary branch. The message said no action should be taken and that the office would contact OPM about the Musk email.\nOther workers and agencies were unsure if the email was real, given its unorthodox timing.\n\u201cIt is possible that this new message sent outside of normal business hours was sent in error and/or is a phishing attempt,\u201d said an email to some staff from NOAA leadership. \u201cUntil such time as we can verify that the message that was received \u2026 is authentic, please do not respond.\u201d\nThe email also prompted defiance from Democrats and angry workers exhausted by Musk\u2019s efforts.\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) said in a statement Sunday that Democrats would block Musk in Congress and the courts.\n\u201cElon Musk is traumatizing hardworking federal employees, their children and families,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cHe has no legal authority to make his latest demands.\u201d\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) called the request \u201cabsurd\u201d and defended government employees. \u201cIf Elon Musk truly wants to understand what federal workers accomplished over the past week, he should get to know each department and agency, and learn about the jobs he\u2019s trying to cut.\u201d\nAt least one staffer responded to the email with resistance. A worker with the U.S. Geological Survey forwarded the \u201cWhat did you do last week?\u201d email to his direct supervisors informing them he \u201ccategorically\u201d refused to reply.\n\u201cThere is no way that a team of people will read &gt;2 million responses to this message,\u201d the employee wrote. \u201cAnyone who replies is likely to have their responses fed into some AI woodchipper and used for goodness knows what purpose, legal or illegal.\u201d\nHe then urged his bosses to defend their employees and \u201cpush back on these efforts to harass and intimidate us. We are all watching to see whose side you are on.\u201d\nLeaders within a NASA directorate advertised the email as a chance to tout workers\u2019 accomplishments, writing that employees should reply with speed, accuracy and detail.\n\u201cIn just the next two weeks we have 4 launches and 2 lunar landings with missions that will expand our understanding of the first stages of the Universe,\u201d the NASA email stated. \u201cEvery one of you play key roles in these momentous endeavors \u2026 and can supply many more than just 5 accomplishments in any given week to showcase our mission.\u201d\nBut at almost the same time elsewhere within NASA, another group of employees received opposite instructions.\nOne director wrote, \u201cI recognize there are many concerns already being elevated around the request [including] data that would be sent un-encrypted. \u2026 The agency is asking employees to take a pause and wait for additional communication and guidance.\u201d\nAnd on Sunday morning, the NASA directorate that had urged employees to reply reversed its guidance. \u201cPlease go ahead and prepare your bullets but do not submit \u2026 until you receive further guidance,\u201d a leader there wrote.\n\n<i>Ellen Nakashima, John Hudson, Mariana Alfaro, Warren Strobel, Derek Hawkins, Spencer S.
