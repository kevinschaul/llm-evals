Noem signaled Wednesday morning that the Trump administration is considering using the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention camp to house undocumented immigrants whom officials are seeking to deport.\nAsked directly whether Guant\u00e1namo Bay was an option for sending undocumented immigrants apprehended by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Noem told Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox &amp; Friends\u201d that President Donald Trump and his administration are looking at all their options for expelling people who are in the United States illegally, particularly those from countries that do not currently accept deportees, such as Venezuela and Cuba.\n\u201cWe\u2019re evaluating and talking about that right now. It\u2019s the president\u2019s decision, but it\u2019s an asset, and we\u2019re going to continue to look at how we can use all of our assets to keep America safe,\u201d Noem said.\nGuant\u00e1namo Bay is known for its military prison within the naval base on the coast of Cuba, where suspected terrorists have been held in the years since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It also has a separate migrant processing facility, which the Biden administration used to process some asylum seekers."

        "headline": "Medical evacuations from Gaza slow amid uncertainty over right of return",
        "content": "DOHA, Qatar \u2014 For many Palestinians with critical injuries or chronic illnesses, a medical evacuation out of the Gaza Strip is the only way to access lifesaving care. But now, after President Donald Trump proposed to empty Gaza of its inhabitants, aid workers and doctors say they fear that those leaving the territory could be forfeiting their ability to one day return home.\nInside Gaza, the evacuations have slowed for a range of reasons, including this uncertainty and tightened security checks, according to doctors and aid workers. At the same time, fewer countries are accepting evacuees, a development that aid workers say could partially be a result of fatigue more than a year into the crisis but that also reflects the growing fear that those who leave will not be allowed to return.\nAll of this means a longer wait for families with injured loved ones. But doctors who have worked in Gaza\u2019s hospitals say many of the people awaiting medical evacuations don\u2019t have time.\nAmira Nimerawi, an advocate and aid worker with Health Workers for Palestine, said she\u2019s struggled, knowing that some of the people she has helped to leave Gaza may not be able to go back. \u201cBoth personally and professionally, it is an uncomfortable position and infuriating,\u201d she said.\nBut as a humanitarian worker, she said, her priority will always be delivering lifesaving aid. \u201cHow many more children or other people are we going to lose from preventable conditions? There\u2019s a huge number of people who have died because of lack of access,\u201d she said.\nSince war between Israel and Hamas broke out in October 2023, the need for medical care outside Gaza has ballooned. The World Health Organization says 25,000 people in Gaza are in need of medical evacuation, including 2,500 children who need urgent attention for war wounds and for chronic diseases like cancer that cannot be treated in the territory.\nDuring the early months of the war, medical evacuations happened regularly. Between November 2023 and May 2024, some 4,900 wounded or critically ill people were transported out of Gaza for treatment in neighboring Egypt and farther afield in the Persian Gulf, Europe and even the United States. But since then, thousands of severely wounded and chronically ill Palestinians have been trapped inside Gaza after its Rafah border crossing with Egypt was shut by Israeli military operations eight months ago.\nQatar, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have accepted the vast majority of injured and sick Gazans since the war began. About 2,300 patients and family members are in Abu Dhabi, and some 2,500 people are in Doha, according to foreign ministry tallies. Tens of thousands of Gazans have crossed into Egypt since the fighting erupted, many but not all seeking medical treatment. Last week, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II pledged that his country would accept 2,000 sick children from Gaza, but it is unclear when those evacuations will occur.\nMimi Syed, an emergency medicine doctor, treated some of the children who are now waiting for medical evacuations from Gaza. She said many of them need repeated surgeries as they recover from gunshot wounds, severe burns or amputations, procedures that would be considered \u201csimple\u201d at the hospital where she practices in Washington state.\n\u201cMany of these kids are kids who, if they lived in the United States, would be able to lead normal lives,\u201d she said. But, she said, because of the lack of medical facilities and the high risk of infection in Gaza, delayed treatment \u201cis a death sentence.\u201d\nInitially, the ceasefire reached last month between Israel and Hamas gave doctors like Syed hope that medical evacuations would ramp up. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Rafah was to be reopened for medical evacuations, starting with 50 patients a day plus their caregivers.\nBut evacuations have been bedeviled by several issues. Tightened security checks by Israel and Egypt, and strict rules governing who can accompany the wounded as caregivers, have slowed the issuing of permits to depart Gaza. And citing overwhelmed medical facilities, Egyptian authorities have limited the number of people they are willing to take. Aid workers and doctors say that on most days there are fewer than 50 patients evacuated, and on some days no one gets out.\n\u201cHonestly speaking, any child who needs it should be able to get out through this process. But unless you see a foreigner, or somebody connects you to an NGO, or you somehow get on the news, it\u2019s very, very difficult,\u201d said Ayesha Khan, a Stanford University doctor who also recently volunteered in Gaza.\nFour-year-old Mira Dreni, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head in August, is one of the children waiting for a medical evacuation. Doctors in Gaza were able to save Mira from the initial injury, but because she is still growing, the hollow surgical tube placed in her brain to help keep her alive needs to be replaced, a procedure that medical facilities in Gaza cannot perform.\nMira\u2019s application for a medical evacuation has been pending for months, and her mother, Israa Haboush, said the last update she received from the World Health Organization was that they were still awaiting Israeli security checks.\nFor injured children, both the child and a family member must be approved for travel. Male relatives are most frequently denied security approval, and those individuals denied are not informed why, according to aid organizations. Syed, the doctor from Washington state, said that in some instances, the rules limiting one caregiver per patient are separating families.\n\u201cWhat it\u2019s doing is it\u2019s forcing parents to make a decision between leaving their children behind or getting care,\u201d she said. These decisions are all the more agonizing because of heightened uncertainty about their ability to return since Trump proposed displacing all Palestinians from Gaza.\nSuhad Khateeb, who left Gaza for Doha with her two youngest sons for emergency treatment, said she never would have expected to still be separated from her husband a year later.\nShe said the first few days after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike were a frantic blur. Khateeb\u2019s 4-year-old son, Wissam, was inside the house when it was hit. The building partially collapsed, and Wissam suffered injuries to his head and face so severe that doctors at the first hospital she took him to refused to give him a bed.\n\u201cThey thought he would die immediately. I had to beg for a blood transfusion,\u201d Khateeb said. Once he was stabilized, she got seats in a United Nations convoy traveling to southern Gaza. From there, she was transferred to a hospital in Egypt and a few weeks later to Doha, where her son finally got specialized treatment.\nSince then, Wissam has made a remarkable recovery, she said. When they first arrived, he had lost the ability to speak because of the swelling around his brain. Now he\u2019s begun walking a bit on his own. Khateeb and her sons live in a compound outside Doha initially built to house athletes during the 2022 World Cup.\nNow, the rows of neat apartment blocks are full of Palestinian families. In a central courtyard, groups of children run and play despite carrying scars from a war more than 1,000 miles away: severe burns, amputated limbs, missing digits.\nKhateeb dismissed Trump\u2019s comments about emptying Gaza as \u201ccrazy talk, dreams.\u201d But when asked about her future, she acknowledged that she cannot return to Gaza until Wissam is fully healed \u2014 and that could be years away. She said her decision to leave her husband and older children fills her with such overpowering sadness that for days at a time she can\u2019t eat.\nOther Palestinians in the compound describe similar feelings. Yehya al-Ustaz, 68, suffered two broken legs when his home in Gaza was hit by an airstrike and now relies on a wheelchair.\nHe said he\u2019s been horrified by images of the destruction in the enclave. \u201cAn earthquake would have been kinder.\u201d But he said, \u201cNothing is like Gaza. Ultimately, Gaza is home. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n<i>Hajar Harb in London contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "The National Park Service predicted Thursday that D.C.\u2019s iconic cherry trees will reach peak bloom from March 28 to March 31.\nPeak bloom is declared by the agency when 70 percent of the blossoms around the Tidal Basin \u2014 the reservoir on the National Mall \u2014 have opened. Organizers expect 1.5 million people to visit the flowering trees during this year\u2019s National Cherry Blossom Festival.\nThe festival, which commemorates the 3,000 cherry trees Japan gifted to the United States as a symbol of friendship in 1912, will run from March 20 through April 13. The event \u2014 featuring an opening ceremony of Japanese performers, a parade along Constitution Avenue, live music at the Tidal Basin and a kite festival on the Washington Monument grounds \u2014 kicks off spring.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really one of <i>the</i> traditions of the nation\u2019s capital,\u201d said Mike Litterst, a spokesperson for the Park Service. \u201cIt\u2019s that sign that spring is finally here. It\u2019s sort of that one unifying thing that occurs in D.C. It\u2019s not blue, it\u2019s not red; for the few weeks that the trees are out, everybody is all about the pink.\u201d\nThis year marks the first cherry blossom season when construction will be underway to rehabilitate the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/dc-low-lying-city-flood-risks/\" target=\"_blank\">crumbling sea walls</a> around the Tidal Basin and West Potomac Park. The three-year renovation is part of a nearly $500 million project to improve infrastructure on the National Mall before the 250th anniversary of American independence in 2026.\nLitterst said visitors should expect construction between the Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt memorials, typically prime real estate for cherry blossom viewing.\n\u201cFolks will find fencing, they\u2019ll find screening in places, but all of the walkways are open, the roads are open and, most significantly, there will still be plenty of cherry trees in bloom,\u201d Litterst said.\nLast year, the Park Service <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/13/cherry-trees-cut-down-washington/\" target=_blank>removed 158 cherry trees</a> for the project \u2014 including the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/05/24/stumpy-removed-tidal-basin/\" target=_blank>much-loved Stumpy</a> \u2014 but Litterst said more than 2,500 trees remain around the Tidal Basin, with roughly 1,000 more on the Washington Monument grounds and in East Potomac Park.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Capital Weather Gang independently estimates peak bloom and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/02/26/dc-cherry-blossom-forecast-2025/\" target=_blank>predicted this year</a> that the blossoms will reach peak bloom between March 23 and 27, about five days earlier than normal.\nAccording to the Capital Weather Gang, climate change has spurred D.C.\u2019s iconic trees to flower earlier over time. The blossom\u2019s average peak has advanced about a week over the past century, from April 4 to March 29, with last year\u2019s March 17 peak bloom tying for the second-earliest on record. March 15, 1990, was the earliest record peak bloom.\nCity leaders, including D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, and National Cherry Blossom Festival organizers gathered at an annual news conference Thursday at the Waldorf Astoria in downtown D.C. to announce the peak bloom prediction.\nDiana Mayhew, president of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, credited the event for making D.C. \u201cthe springtime destination,\u201d in an interview ahead of the event. Last year, she said 1.6 million people \u2014 46 percent from the D.C. area and 54 percent tourists \u2014 flocked to the nation\u2019s capital to witness the beauty of the blossoms. The festival generated $202 million in visitor spending in D.C. last year, Mayhew said.\nCity leaders have hoped in recent years that the cherry blossoms could be a catalyst for tourism and reinvigorating the city\u2019s struggling downtown since the pandemic.\nBut Mayhew, who has organized the festival for 25 years, added that it\u2019s important to her that the celebration is not only for tourists. To \u201croll out the pink carpet for everyone,\u201d she said, festival organizers have launched community outreach programs and partnerships in all eight D.C. wards. Many of the initiatives focus on youths, including a program that sends local artists to lead workshops at D.C. schools and the \u201cKites in the Classroom\u201d program, which encourages elementary-schoolers to design, build and fly their own kites as an extension of the Blossom Kite Festival.\nOn Thursday, Mayhew also said the festival would include a new event to \u201cto keep Stumpy\u2019s spirit alive.\u201d The first Stumpy\u2019s Petals and Paddles boat race will take place on March 20 at the Tidal Basin.\n\u201cSpring is such a joyous time here in D.C.\u201d Mayhew said."

        "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Mayor Eric Adams\u2019s attorney argued Wednesday that the case against him should be dismissed permanently, alleging that leaks of a former top prosecutor\u2019s resignation letter discussing the indictment prevented any future fair trial.\nThe motion filed by Adams lawyer Alex Spiro argued that the mayor\u2019s right to a fair trial was tainted by former acting U.S. attorney Danielle Sassoon\u2019s leaked Feb. 12 letter that said the case was strong and that her office was prepared to file additional charges for obstruction.\nSassoon also said she believed a quid pro quo existed between a top figure at the Justice Department and Adams, and that the mayor committed to help with President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration efforts in exchange for seeing his case dismissed.\nAdams and the Justice Department have denied a quid quo pro exists, but the ordeal and the government\u2019s decision to abandon the public corruption matter have drawn an immense amount of controversy.\nActing deputy attorney general Emil Bove argued in court last week without offering proof that the case was politically motivated and would interfere with the 2025 mayoral election. Bove asked Judge Dale Ho to dismiss the case \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d which would leave open a possible future revival of the matter.\nSpiro argued in his letter to Ho on Wednesday that the case should be dismissed \u201cwith prejudice\u201d instead, because \u201cthe government\u2019s conduct has destroyed whatever presumption of innocence Mayor Adams had left.\u201d\nHo cannot ultimately deny Bove\u2019s request, but he did not immediately toss the case. He instead assigned an independent lawyer to evaluate arguments against the government\u2019s dismissal request."

        "headline": "GOP lawmakers scramble to protect foreign aid as food relief languishes",
        "content": "As GOP lawmakers in Washington try to protect a key food aid program from the Trump administration\u2019s cutbacks, international humanitarian organizations say the ongoing disruptions<b> </b>in assistance are devastating countries that are on the verge of famine.\nThe administration\u2019s move in late January to gut the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/01/foreign-aid-freeze-state-department-usaid/\" target=_blank>laying off thousands of workers</a> and freezing funding<b> </b>in more than 100 countries \u2014 immediately jeopardized Food for Peace. For more than 70 years, the $2 billion program has purchased surplus commodities from American farmers for distribution overseas.\nLate Thursday, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered administration officials to temporarily lift their freeze on U.S. aid and development programs abroad. He alluded to the \u201cshockwave\u201d caused by their action and said they \u201chave not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid \u2026 was a rational precursor to reviewing programs.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump and top adviser Elon Musk, a tech billionaire, have been highly critical of USAID\u2019s work, with Trump baselessly claiming the agency had committed \u201ctremendous fraud.\u201d \nDespite a State Department waiver for emergency food assistance, those shipments still had been delayed around the world, a USAID inspector general wrote in a report Monday \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/11/trump-fires-usaid-inspector-general/\" target=_blank>a day before he was dismissed</a>. The bottleneck, Paul K. Martin wrote, put more than $489 million in food assistance at risk of spoilage or theft as it waited at ports, in transit and in warehouses.\nIn defending itself in court, Ali noted, the government acknowledged that the waiver process \u201cmay have had \u2018hiccups.\u2019\u201d\nAid groups had said Thursday that some food deliveries were starting to move through shipping channels but that millions more pounds of corn, lentils and pinto beans remained stuck because the agency\u2019s payment system was not functioning.\nThe waiver for lifesaving assistance that was in place before the judge\u2019s order was \u201ctheoretical\u201d because \u201cthe payment system that reimburses partners for expenses they incur is offline,\u201d said Sarah Charles, former head of USAID\u2019s Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, which oversaw the Food for Peace program. Some relief agencies are still owed for services rendered in December and January, she added.\nAt a contentious meeting at the State Department, the Trump appointee tasked with overseeing USAID \u2014 or what is left of it \u2014 had assured aid workers and congressional staff that aid payments would resume early next week. But Peter Marocco also said that a department review of the agency\u2019s remaining projects was underway and that those that do not \u201cgive the president real influence\u201d will be cut, according to a readout of the event obtained by The Washington Post.\nA department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\nComplicating the administration\u2019s narrative is a growing tide of Republican lawmakers and former officials who say it\u2019s not quite accurate.\nAndrew Natsios, who served as USAID administrator during the George W. Bush administration, told lawmakers this week that even those relief organizations already granted waivers haven\u2019t been able to \u201cissue checks\u201d and keep working because of the shutdown of USAID\u2019s payment system.\nThat includes Christian humanitarian groups, which receive $1 billion a year, Natsios said at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing<b> </b>Thursday. The session was meant to highlight what Trump and his allies say is USAID\u2019s wasteful spending but instead underscored concerns about the flow of critical assistance, as two of the three expert witnesses warned of dire consequences for U.S. interests and national security if the aid did not resume soon.\nSen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), who has urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \u201cquickly ship and distribute\u201d the American-grown food assistance, is among those questioning what\u2019s happening on the ground.\nMoran said the State Department last weekend had notified participating groups that they could restart operations. He is skeptical that there has been much impact so far. \u201cMy impression is that waivers were granted, but then it doesn\u2019t seem like it was making a significant difference,\u201d he told The Post.\n\nHe is working with Rep. Tracey Mann (R), a fellow Kansan, and other lawmakers to protect Food for Peace by moving it to the U.S. Department of Agriculture as \u201cpart of an ongoing effort to save money and increase efficiency,\u201d Moran said in a statement. That proposal has gained widespread support from agricultural groups.\nFounded in Kansas, Food for Peace was signed into law in 1954 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It has long been championed by the state\u2019s leaders, including former senator Robert J. Dole, and has helped more than 4 billion people in over 150 countries since its inception.\nThe program is a source of pride for farmers. But it has been criticized over the years for various issues, including the potential to undermine local agriculture in recipient countries and exacerbate conflicts in war-torn areas, according to Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute.\nEven if the lawmakers prevail, the program\u2019s ultimate survival is not guaranteed.\nNick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, pointed to the USDA\u2019s new secretary. Brooke Rollins, former head of a conservative Texas think tank, was confirmed Thursday.\n\u201cWhat happens if she goes into this office cleaning house?\u201d Levendofsky asked. \u201cAnd what about when Elon Musk comes over to USDA? Anything is to be expected at this point.\u201d\nKansas is the country\u2019s biggest grower of sorghum, and millions of bushels of the high-protein grain are backed up in warehouses across the state. Kim Barnes, chief financial officer of the Pawnee County Cooperative Association, a grain trader in central Kansas, said he\u2019s storing more than 1.3 million bushels of sorghum because of a market downturn over the last year \u2014 a situation that will only worsen with USAID cutbacks.\nIt\u2019s a shame, he said, adding: \u201cThere are still countries that need it.\u201d\nOn Thursday, a different federal judge <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/13/usaid-workers-trump-leave-ruling/\" target=_blank>extended a block</a> on the Trump administration\u2019s plan to place thousands of USAID employees on leave. But with thousands of contractors already<i><b> </b></i>fired, the agency\u2019s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance could ultimately lose more than 90 percent of its workforce, Martin, the inspector general, wrote. That outcome exacerbates concerns about whether any existing staff can work with locals on the ground to distribute the commodities, he added.\nThe <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">temporary gap in supplies has been \u201cdevastating\u201d</a> some countries, said Paul Spiegel, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health and former chief of public health in the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\u201cThere has already been much damage done that will be difficult to undo,\u201d Spiegel said Friday. \u201cThe administration has not always done what they said they would do providing exceptions for humanitarian response, so the question remains: Will they allow funds to go out, or will they simply slow it down and the pain and suffering of all these vulnerable people around the globe will continue?\u201d\nDuaa Tarig, who worked as an art curator in Sudan before war broke out, said she personally knew three people who recently died of malnutrition in her Khartoum neighborhood.\nThe pattern is familiar. During a 10-day period last year, many died when soup kitchens in the city were forced to shutter for lack of funding, she recounted. Weakened by starvation, individuals succumbed quickly to malaria or dengue fever.\nWith USAID funding curtailed, more than 80 percent of those soup kitchens have closed again, she said. Many of those remaining open are unable to afford the lentils they usually buy and are scraping together vegetable soups.\n\u201cEveryone, including myself, have lost a lot of weight. Some have lost more than half their body weight. I see the faces of people I used to know and I can\u2019t recognize them \u2014 they are just bone and skin,\u201d she said.\n<i>Houreld reported from Nairobi.

        "content": "The notices popped into email boxes all over the country Monday afternoon, notifying researchers who collect, analyze and study data on the American education system that their contracts were terminated, effective immediately. No reason was given.\nThe nixed contracts support the Institute for Education Sciences at the Education Department, known as IES,<b> </b>and inside the agency, staff questioned whether the cuts were legal, much less justified.\nBut the decisions were not made by the institute\u2019s leaders or education experts. Rather, the canceled contracts were all on a list drawn up by a U.S. DOGE Service team that is working to unravel the Education Department, stripping the agency of staff, terminating contracts and \u2014 soon \u2014 canceling program grants, according to people familiar with DOGE activity who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re completely crippled,\u201d said one IES employee. \u201cIt really prevents us from serving the mission we thought we were carrying out.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump has made clear he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/\">wants the Education Department shuttered</a>. Absent congressional action to do that, his administration is at work dismantling it on its own.\nOn Wednesday, at least 50 recently hired employees who were on probation were abruptly dismissed without cause across the department, according to union leaders. Staff have been warned that layoffs are coming. And managers inside the agency have been instructed to identify workers who can be converted to a new job status that would strip them of some worker protections, according to a person with direct knowledge of the order.\nIn addition, DOGE caused about 100 Education Department employees to be put on administrative leave for their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/10/education-department-dei-devos/\">mostly tangential</a> connections to diversity, equity and inclusion<b> </b>programs, based on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/22/dei-federal-employees-trump/\">Trump\u2019s executive order</a> to rid the federal government of DEI offices and initiatives. And in <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/\">an executive order</a> Tuesday, Trump instructed departments heads across the government to hire no more than one employee for every four employees who depart, and to plan for mass layoffs.\n\u201cThe inmates are running the asylum, and the goal is chaos and the goal is destruction,\u201d Arne Duncan, who served as education secretary in the Obama administration, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this in our lifetime.\u201d\nOn Friday, the department announced another round of cancellations: $336 million in canceled contracts for Regional Educational Laboratories, which help states apply evidence-based practices to teaching and that <a href=\"https://www.the74million.org/article/from-covid-learning-loss-to-artificial-intelligence-education-rd-cant-wait/\" target=\"_blank\">have been praised</a> by the former Tennessee schools chief who Trump nominated as deputy secretary of education.\nThe cancellation of contracts began at IES, but is expected to extend to other parts of the department. A department spokeswoman, Madi Biedermann, said earlier this week that 89 contracts worth nearly $900 million had been canceled at IES \u2014 not counting the new crop canceled on Friday.\nOther officials said the total number was 167 or 169. It\u2019s not clear what accounted for the discrepancy. IES has a small full-time staff; most of its work is<b> </b>contracted out.\nIt\u2019s also not clear<b> </b>whether the savings are as deep as the<b> </b>department said.\nNat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, pulled data on the canceled contracts that suggested DOGE overstated the cost of some of them. He also found that, in many cases, contractors are already several years into their agreements, so a lot of the money has been spent already. His preliminary calculations show that the actual savings may be half as much as DOGE claims, or less.\nMalkus\u2019s concern is that agreements were canceled without careful consideration, and for less of a benefit than advertised.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bloat in IES. There\u2019s a lot of problems to be solved,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are problems you solve with a scalpel and maybe a hatchet, but not a bulldozer.\u201d\n\u2018Complete confusion\u2019\nThe \u201cbulldozer\u201d arrived at IES on Monday, when a young representative of DOGE delivered the list of contracts to be terminated to the department\u2019s acting director. Soon after, a flurry of emergency meetings began, first with managers and then with rank-and-file employees, announcing that the contracts were being canceled, effective immediately.\nThere were no reasons given for the cuts, attendees said, except that DOGE wanted them. The mood was somber, with some holding back tears, staffers said. Confused IES employees asked repeatedly about the legality of DOGE\u2019s actions, but they didn\u2019t get an answer.\nMeantime, on the outside, texts, emails and calls were bouncing among researchers and contractors as word spread of canceled contracts. The feeling was utter shock and \u201ccomplete confusion,\u201d said Rachel Dinkes, president and CEO of Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education research groups.\nInside and outside the department, those close to IES research said they<b> </b>were unsettled by the youth and inexperience of DOGE representatives recommending the cancellations, as well as what seemed to be a lack of understanding of the complex, interdependent ecosystem of contracts maintained by IES.\nFor instance, one canceled contract was for work on the Common Core of Data, the primary database of all K-12 schools in the United States. It includes data on enrollment, demographics and other information about students and teachers, and is used by researchers, government agencies and others for a wide range of reasons. It is, said Dinkes, the \u201cbackbone\u201d of knowledge about American education and needed for virtually any effort to compare and analyze schools.\nContracts for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/01/29/nations-report-card-naep-test-scores-fall/\">National Assessment of Educational Progress</a>, or NAEP, exams were not canceled. But Dinkes and others said that NAEP relies on the Common Core of Data when it creates the sample<b> </b>of schools to administer tests. So running the testing program, sometimes called the Nation\u2019s Report Card, will be harder without the Common Core of Data, she said.\nIn another example, DOGE killed a contract for interpreting data IES collects from colleges and universities tracking enrollment and financial aid. The raw data will still be gathered, but the studies that made sense of it for the public are gone. That will make it harder to understand how students are using financial aid, staffers said, and to identify barriers to higher education.\n\u201cSure, you have the raw data that scientists can fiddle with, but the necessary step of digesting that in ways that answer questions, it\u2019s gone,\u201d a staffer said. \u201cNow you need a PhD to make any sense of it.\u201d\nDOGE also canceled contracts IES maintained to publish practice guides for students and schools on topics including how to prepare for college, how to succeed in high school, how to become literate in STEM \u2014 and, for educators, how to solve attendance problems. The guides were the most popular product IES publishes, staffers said.\n\nIn other cases, contracts were for programs that are designed to test the most effective way to solve a problem within the education system. For instance, one contractor was running a study looking at how best to accelerate math learning, Dinkes said. She said the study involved giving half of a group of students<b> </b>one type of instruction and the other half another. The goal was to see which teaching method produced better math results.\nBut the experiment was abruptly terminated this week when the contract was canceled, she said, and the students are no longer getting either of the math interventions.\nBefore the cuts, some employees tried to lay out these complexities for DOGE representatives, a staffer said. Some contracts were expendable, they suggested, but others were not. But the employees were unable to sway DOGE team.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve effectively dismantled us,\u201d said one staffer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re completely crippled,\u201d said another.\nIn addition, many of the canceled contracts were nearing the end of multiyear projects, so terminating them meant time, effort and money already expended may go to waste.\n\u201cCanceling them now yields the taxpayers no return on their investment,\u201d said a statement from American Institutes for Research, which had 15 IES contracts worth more than $180 million, according to DOGE\u2019s list, which was obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cThis is an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\nBiedermann, the department spokeswoman, said the contracts were costing more than they were worth. But she said she didn\u2019t know<b> </b>how or why DOGE reached that conclusion. \u201cThe significant amount of money as compared to the outcomes generated for students is not commensurate,\u201d she said.\nAsked how DOGE workers have the requisite expertise to make these determinations, she said, \u201cThe entire goal of DOGE is to cut waste, and they have been trained to identify that.\u201d\nContracts that can be justified or that are congressionally mandated will be rebid, which can be a lengthy process, officials said.\nThe cancellations hung over the confirmation hearing Thursday for Linda McMahon, Trump\u2019s nominee for Education secretary, with several Democrat senators pressing her on what was going on inside the agency.\nSen. Edward J. Markey (D-Massachusetts) said DOGE rightfully stands for the \u201cDepartment of Gutting Education.\u201d\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s just a down payment to gut the education of every public school student in America,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst they announce the cuts. Then they go to find where it is. So it\u2019s all backwards.\u201d\nGrants on the chopping block\nStaff at the Education Department<b> </b>are now bracing for the next round of cuts, they said, including more grant cancellations.\nMost of the money that Education sends to schools is distributed by a formula, but more than $7 billion is given through competitive grant programs, such as one that pays for after school programs and another that supports charter schools.\nLast week, staffers were directed to review all grants that have \u201cillegal DEI in them,\u201d another employee said. On Monday, a DOGE account on X <a href=\"https://x.com/DOGE/status/1889105335991820585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1889105335991820585%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc\">said</a> that it had terminated 29 \u201cDEI training grants\u201d at the Education Department totaling $101 million.\nAlso on Monday, DOGE was given access to scour a database detailing all the department\u2019s grants, said one person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private proceedings. \u201cGrants will be [canceled] this week or early next,\u201d the person predicted.\nThen, on Friday, the department announced it was terminating $33 million in grants for Equity Assistance Centers, a program created to support school desegregation but that the department said supports \u201cdivisive training.\u201d\nThe DOGE team has also gained access to sensitive department data, including the personal information of millions of borrowers who\u2019ve taken out federal student loans. That\u2019s led to a 30-fold increase in complaints<b> </b>to a privacy office at the department, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nDuncan, the former education secretary, said DOGE workers have no qualifications and no legal right to access Americans\u2019 personal data. More important, he said, they have the wrong goals.\n\u201cAll this sound and noise and drama and not one word about helping more kids learn to read,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even a mention.\u201d"

Videos of Quran burnings by a small group of men in Sweden and Denmark that year ignited a global controversy, drawing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/03/sweden-quran-burning-denmark-islam-stunt-global-attention/\" target=\"_blank\">condemnation</a> from several Muslim nations and leading to riots in some places.\nOn Thursday, the Stockholm District Court <a href=\"https://www.domstol.se/stockholms-tingsratt/nyheter/2025/01/domen-om-koranbranningarna-uppskjuten/\" target=_blank>said</a> a verdict in a trial in which Momika was a defendant was postponed because one of the defendants died.

It said Momika, 38, had come to Sweden in 2018 and was later granted a temporary residence permit.

        "headline": "NFL competition committee begins mulling possible tweaks to kickoff format",
        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The NFL will consider modifying its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/03/27/nfl-new-kickoff-breakdown/\" target=_blank>year-old kickoff format</a> this offseason by moving the spot of the ball <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/10/01/nfl-kickoff-format-change/\" target=_blank>on a touchback</a> or by moving the spot of the kick itself, the co-chairman of the league\u2019s competition committee said Sunday.\nThe comments by Rich McKay, also the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons, came after the committee held its first meeting of the week at the NFL scouting combine as part of the league\u2019s offseason rule-change process.\n\u201cIf something is going to be proposed as far as modifications \u2026 which would be the potential of moving the touchback and/or moving the kicker back, I think those will get talked about, you know, within the next 30 days,\u201d McKay said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll take a little while before we get everybody\u2019s input.\u201d\nThe kickoff format must be reapproved this offseason by the NFL\u2019s team owners, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/03/26/nfl-kickoff-change/\" target=_blank>ratified it last offseason</a> on a one-year basis. That is expected to happen. The alignment fulfilled its dual mandate by raising the percentage of kickoffs being returned while bringing the injury rate on the play more in line with that of a running or passing play.\nBut the owners also could have proposed tweaks to consider when they gather late next month at the annual league meeting in Palm Beach, Florida. Those changes would be designed to promote even more returns. The spot of the touchback on a kickoff could be moved from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line to further discourage kicks into the end zone. Or the kick itself could be moved five yards back, making it more challenging for kickers to reach the opposite end zone. It\u2019s also possible both changes could be enacted.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have people that\u2019ll say both,\u201d McKay said Sunday. \u201cYou\u2019ll have people say one or the other. It\u2019s always easier to start with one or the other than it is both. And you want to have all of the health and safety implications or potential implications from either change. But I think it\u2019ll be one or the other, I would think. You never know. I know there\u2019s people already talking about, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s talk about both.\u2019 But I also know there\u2019s this thing called 24 votes.\u201d\nAny proposed rule changes must be ratified by at least 24 of the 32 teams.\nThe competition committee met Sunday with a group of special teams coaches who contributed last offseason to crafting the format, in which the kicker lines up alone on one half of the field while his teammates line up on the opposite side of the field, only a few yards from players on the receiving team. The group is scheduled to meet Monday with NFL health and safety officials.\n\u201cThe easier of the options to make sure that you\u2019re going to move the number up on return percentage, in my mind, is the touchback,\u201d McKay said. \u201cOur kickers now in the game are really good. So moving the kick back, I don\u2019t know how much you impact that.\u201d\nThe competition committee also spoke to the special teams coaches Sunday about the onside kick. League leaders have called the onside kick <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/18/nfl-onside-kick/\" target=_blank>a \u201cdead\u201d and \u201cceremonial\u201d play</a> because of its low success rate. Under the current kickoff format, a team must declare its intention to attempt an onside kick only while trailing in the fourth quarter. At that point, the alignment reverts to the traditional kickoff setup so the team can try an onside kick.\nThe special teams coaches believe the onside kick success rate could be improved with adjustments to the rules dictating how the teams must align themselves to begin the play, McKay said. But alternatively, McKay said he could foresee renewed consideration being given this offseason to a fourth-and-15 or fourth-and-20 alternative to the onside kick. That measure, which would enable a team to retain possession of the ball by converting such a fourth-down offensive play, has been proposed by individual NFL teams in the past without ever coming particularly close to being approved by the owners.\n\u201cI still believe it could\u201d be considered again this offseason, McKay said. \u201cI could see it because [teams have] brought it up before. That said, you have to get 24 votes. So you have to have other alternatives, one of which may be, \u2018Okay, should we tweak the way that they line up and see if we can get the percentage to move?\u2019\u201d\nThe committee spent two hours Sunday on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/01/22/nfl-officiating-patrick-mahomes-roughing/\" target=\"_blank\">potential further expansion</a> of the list of plays that could be subject <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/02/nfl-electronic-first-downs-replay-assist/\" target=\"_blank\">to the replay assist system</a>, McKay said, and will spend more time on that topic Monday.

That system still would require the on-field officials to spot the ball manually following a play before the electronic system would be used to determine whether a first down was achieved.\nThe push-the-quarterback sneak <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/08/tush-push-eagles-super-bowl/\" target=_blank>popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles</a> was not discussed Sunday by the committee, McKay said, but he added: \u201cI think it will be.\u201d"

DOGE\u2019s flurry of moves in the first month of the new presidential administration have sparked dozens of lawsuits across the country.\nIn a written opinion Friday, U.S. District Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr. said the nonprofit and the federal worker seeking a preliminary injunction had \u201cnot provided concrete evidence that Defendants are actively misusing or even attempting to misuse their sensitive data.\u201d\nA federal court in Manhattan already had imposed a temporary ban on DOGE access to Americans\u2019 private data held by the Treasury, and other requests for temporary bans are pending before a federal judge in D.C. Alston was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term.\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 fears of future harm are much too speculative and would require the Court to make several leaps in reasoning in order to warrant injunctive relief,\u201d Alston wrote.\nJohn L. Davisson, director of litigation for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said at a hearing Friday that exposing millions of Americans\u2019 private financial data in a \u201chistorically large and consequential breach\u201d violated several federal laws and the Fifth Amendment, and could leave the United States more vulnerable to malign actors.\nIn one of his first executive orders last month, Trump charged DOGE and its de facto leader, billionaire Elon Musk, with modernizing government agencies and reviewing their functions. Justice Department attorneys said in a legal filing that the groups suing over DOGE\u2019s moves were \u201cseeking unprecedented judicial micromanagement of the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to share government data with its own employees.\u201d\nJonathan Lucier, an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, said at a court hearing Friday that the employees in question were all hired by Treasury and OPM or detailed to those agencies. Granting data access to in-house employees carrying out a presidential initiative \u201ccannot be illegal,\u201d Lucier argued.\nTom Krause, a tech company chief executive who briefly worked for DOGE, is now a senior Treasury adviser and the only liaison to the group. Justice Department attorneys said in court papers that he has never been given \u201cdirect access\u201d to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service payment system, only \u201cover-the-shoulder\u201d access \u201cto review activity others performed in the system or data others accessed from the system.\u201d\nBut Justice Department attorneys acknowledged in a footnote that another employee who began working at DOGE and was then hired by Treasury, Marko Elez, did have access to the closely guarded payment system \u2014 which includes details of highly classified programs \u2014 until he resigned Feb. 6. He was found to have made racist statements on social media. Musk said he would rehire Elez, who now works at the Social Security Administration, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/doge-staffer-behind-racist-posts-reappears-at-social-security?embedded-checkout=true\" target=_blank>according to Bloomberg News</a>.\nIn response to a lawsuit filed by 19 states, another federal court barred Krause from accessing Americans\u2019 personal or financial information pending further legal proceedings. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in Manhattan found that the states would face irreparable harm without the temporary ban \u201cbecause of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.\u201d\nAnother federal judge in Manhattan <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/doge-treasury-data-access/\" target=_blank>issued a preliminary injunction</a> in that case Friday, prohibiting DOGE from accessing the Treasury data while the states\u2019 lawsuit is pending.

U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, a Trump appointee, first entered a restraining order last week stopping the plan.\nOn Thursday, he told Justice Department employees to submit to him by Friday the steps it was taking to ensure overseas employees\u2019 safety and to indicate whether it would cover employees\u2019 other benefits, such as school or car payments, while they are on leave.\nNichols had set his original restraining order to expire at 11:59 p.m. Friday. He extended all the deadlines in the order by one week, while he drafts an opinion on whether to enjoin the spending shutdowns throughout the litigation. He amended the order to ban involuntary evacuations of USAID workers overseas, but not voluntary ones.\nLawyers on both sides were not fully clear last week how many USAID workers were affected. The government said in an affidavit that 2,140 employees had been placed on paid leave as of Feb. 7, replacing the 2,700 figure used in last week\u2019s hearing. The government said 98 percent of those placed on leave were stationed in the United States. The unions said Thursday USAID employs about 4,700 people, and about 1,400 live abroad.\nThe Trump administration has argued that it was merely pausing USAID spending while it examines whether the agency is pursuing Trump\u2019s agenda, and that some top aides were ousted for refusing directions to immediately stop funding. The employees\u2019 union said the pause has already damaged aid programs around the world and possibly placed employees in danger by not paying for their cellphones, internet or other security measures.\nThe suit marks the first major legal challenge to the push by President Donald Trump and his allies, led by billionaire Elon Musk and his U.S. DOGE Service, or Department of Government Efficiency, targeting foreign aid programs and USAID staff as part of their campaign<b> </b>to reshape the federal government. The lawsuit is one of several <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/06/trump-resistance-courts-democrats-musk/\" target=_blank>legal challenges mounted by Trump opponents</a> seeking to<b> </b>slow or halt the administration\u2019s barrage of actions to curtail spending, pare back the administrative state, eradicate diversity initiatives and more.\nThe judge\u2019s extension comes as the Trump administration grows increasingly defensive of the chaos caused by the halt in aid projects around the world.\nOn Thursday, the Trump administration sent an internal memo to USAID employees threatening to fire them if they communicated with the press about continued disruptions to foreign aid despite Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s issuing an exemption for \u201clifesaving humanitarian assistance\u201d last month.\n\u201c\ufeffThe purpose of this memo is to correct a false narrative in the press, and provide clarity for staff on external communications,\u201d wrote USAID official Mark Lloyd to staff in a memo obtained by The Washington Post.\nRubio\u2019s exemption \u201chas continued uninterrupted and was never paused,\u201d Lloyd added. \u201cUnauthorized engagement externally with the press or others is subject to discipline, including dismissal.\u201d\nLeading aid groups say even when they\u2019ve obtained exemptions, they cannot continue their work because Rubio\u2019s \u201cstop work\u201d order has effectively shut down payment systems required to draw down funds. That has resulted in thousands of aid workers and USAID contractors being furloughed, disrupting projects from Asia to Africa to Latin America.\nUSAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.\nIn another move this week, the White House fired the inspector general for USAID on Tuesday after he released a blistering report saying $489 million in food assistance was at risk of spoilage or potential diversion because of the funding freeze and work stoppage.\nThe Trump administration is \u201cengaged in a wholesale and rapid campaign to dissolve the USAID in its entirety,\u201d said attorney Karla Gilbride, representing both the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees. \u201cThat campaign has begun with the freezing of all funding on USAID projects.\u201d\nNichols immediately interjected, saying, \u201cAs I understand it, all funding on all projects is not frozen.\u201d\nGilbride said the government\u2019s claims do \u201cnot match the reality on the ground,\u201d in which bills are not being paid and employees are operating in an information vacuum as USAID leadership in Washington is upended. \u201cIt is not consistent with the declaration that this is just a \u2018pencils down\u2019 pause. Which is what a 90-day review suggested.\u201d\nThe unions have argued that USAID is a body created by Congress, and a law passed last year requires the president to notify and consult Congress if it intends to \u201creorganize or redesign, eliminate, consolidate or downsize any agency,\u201d Gilbride said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary that the court impose the injunction and extend the temporary order so that the situation doesn\u2019t get worse,\u201d Gilbride said.\nWith a preliminary injunction, Nichols would not be making a final judgment on whether the USAID moves are legal. For now, he must decide whether irreparable harm will be caused if he doesn\u2019t issue the injunction while also considering the likelihood of whether the employees will prevail on the larger question.\nNichols seemed particularly concerned by a \u201cclearly harrowing situation\u201d in Democratic Republic of Congo, where USAID staff in Kinshasa had to evacuate due to civil unrest there but couldn\u2019t obtain any funds from Washington to do so, and wound up crossing the Congo River in small boats, leaving their homes and belongings behind.\nJustice Department attorney Eric Hamilton said the Trump administration was \u201ccommitted to every USAID employee\u2019s security, and everyone will be kept safe.\u201d\nHamilton said the Justice Department believes Trump acted within his authority under Article II of the Constitution, and \u201cEight foreign aid statutes recognize the need for presidential direction in this space. We think it\u2019s consistent with all of those authorities, that the president when he comes into office, on the first day to take brief stock to see that foreign aid is only let out consistent with his policy.\u201d\nHamilton added: \u201cWe don\u2019t think a reorganization has happened. It\u2019s a 90-day pause.\u201d But he noted Rubio did send a letter to Congress on Feb. 3 notifying them of the move.\n\u201cThat notice checks the box,\u201d Hamilton said of the requirement for the president to consult with Congress before remaking an agency. \u201cWe think the specifics of that consultation would be a political question.\u201d\nNichols raised the issue of whether the employees\u2019 complaints of mistreatment should be heard by a civil service board, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board, rather than a court. Harrison agreed. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s changing is whether they\u2019re doing work and having access to systems,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThis makes this very much a personnel dispute, not appropriate for federal district court.\u201d\nGilbride responded that going through civil service appeals can \u201ctake years to reach a conclusion. By the time the MSPB process goes through, many years may have passed and there will no longer be a USAID for individuals to return to. \u2026 The unions that are in this case are not seeking damages or back pay on behalf of their members. What they\u2019re seeking is that USAID not be unconstitutionally dissolved.\u201d\nThe extension comes as former U.S. officials who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations have become increasingly vocal about the ramifications of USAID\u2019s dismantling.\nOn Wednesday, more than 200 former officials wrote a letter to leaders of the House and Senate saying \u201cthe human suffering that these cutoffs have caused is catastrophic and heartbreaking.\u201d\n\u201cIn Kenya, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere, aid to survivors of torture was stopped in its tracks,\u201d said the officials, who include Michael Hayden, who headed the National Security Agency during the Bush administration; former CIA officer Bruce Riedel; former Middle East adviser Aaron David Miller; former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch; and others.\n\u201cChildren and adult victims of war and terror who have relied on the United States have been left without care. And in poorer countries around the world, thousands of women and girls will die in the next 90 days due to complications of childbirth that might otherwise have been avoided through interventions funded by Congress and administered by USAID,\u201d they wrote in the letter, obtained by The Post."

        "content": "Does it ever feel like your social media feed just doesn\u2019t get you? Or that it keeps leading your kids down <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/teens-instagram-feed-mental-health/\" target=_blank>unhealthy rabbit holes</a>?\nYou don\u2019t have to put up with it anymore.\nInstagram has released a <a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/reset-instagram-content-suggestions\" target=\"_blank\">long-promised \u201creset\u201d button</a> to U.S. users that clears the algorithms it uses to recommend you photos and videos. TikTok offers a reset button, too. And with a little bit more effort, you can also force YouTube to start fresh with how it recommends what videos to play next.\n\nIt means you now have the power to say goodbye to endless recycled dance moves, polarizing Trump posts, extreme fitness challenges, dramatic pet voice-overs, fruit-cutting tutorials, face-altering filters or whatever other else has taken over your feed like a zombie.\nRight now, many people are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/23/meta-potus-instagram-facebook-tiktok-users/\" target=\"_blank\">fed up</a> with Instagram and its owner Meta \u2014 for filling our apps with junk, for ending <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/08/meta-fact-checking-facebook-instagram-users/\" target=\"_blank\">fact-checking</a> and for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/10/meta-dei-affirmative-action-zuckerberg/\" target=\"_blank\">behavior</a> of its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Resetting my algorithm made my Instagram less annoying without taking the ultimate step of deleting my account. A fresh start is also what the doctor ordered for me and my family\u2019s mental health.\nI know some people love what their apps show them. But the reality is, none of us are really in charge of our social media experience anymore. Instead of just friends, family and the people you choose to follow, nowadays your feed or For You Page is filled with recommended content you never asked for, selected by artificial-intelligence algorithms.\nTheir goal is to keep you hooked, often by showing you things you find outrageous or titillating \u2014 not joyful or calming.\nAnd we know from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/03/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-revealed/\" target=_blank>Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen</a> and others that outrage algorithms can take a particular toll on young people. That\u2019s one reason they\u2019re offering a reset now: because they\u2019re under pressure to give teens and families more control. (Parents of teens, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/17/teen-accounts-parental-controls-setup-instagram/\" target=_blank>see here</a> for some more things you can do to protect your kids.)\n\u201cSometimes we make mistakes,\u201d said Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCjja6Hzc7g/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=_blank>video announcing the reset button</a> last year. \u201cSometimes you might end up in a pattern where you just make Instagram unintentionally into something you do not really love.\u201d (Nice of him to blame us for that, rather than Instagram\u2019s software.)\n\nSo how does the algorithm go awry? It tries to get to know you by tracking every little thing you do. It\u2019s not just likes and shares \u2014 they\u2019re even analyzing your \u201cdwell time,\u201d when you unconsciously scroll more slowly over certain posts.\nBut it doesn\u2019t actually understand your mind. One friend, who\u2019s the mother of a toddler, noticed her Instagram feed was being taken over with smut about parents\u2019 desperate strategies to find private time to do the hokey pokey. Turns out, this is actually a content niche. (How have your feeds gone awry? <a href=\"mailto:geoffrey.fowler@washpost.com\" target=_blank>Email me</a> your horror stories.)\nFor me, an Instagram account I made to share baby photos of my son turned into a fear machine when he was about a month old. It increasingly began showing images of babies with severe and uncommon health conditions, preying on my new-parent vulnerability to the suffering of children.\nI called for Instagram to let us press reset when I <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/12/instagram-algorithm/\" target=_blank>wrote about my nightmare feed</a> in 2022. Now we finally can.\n\nWhat you need to know about how a social media reset works\nAn algorithm reset isn\u2019t the solution to all of our social media problems, but it\u2019s better than what has come before.\nWhen you do the reset on any of your accounts, the recommended content in places like Instagram\u2019s Feed, Explore tab and Reels or TikTok\u2019s For You Page will no longer be tailored to your past behavior.\nYou\u2019ll still see content from friends and accounts you\u2019ve previously chosen to follow. If part of your problem is that you don\u2019t like who you\u2019re following, Instagram will also give you the chance to unfollow a bunch as part of the reset process.\nJust know that once you press reset, you can\u2019t undo it. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make your Instagram much less interesting at first,\u201d warned Instagram\u2019s Mosseri when he announced the reset button.\n\nCounterpoint: You might also see \u201cless interesting\u201d as a good thing. The more likely you are to stop scrolling and put down your phone, the more likely you are to talk to friends, read a book or take a nap. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7iQbBbMAFE\" target=_blank>Free your mind</a>, and the rest will follow.)\nDoing a reset also won\u2019t stop Instagram, TikTok or YouTube from trying to recommend more content you didn\u2019t ask for. They\u2019re just going to start fresh and tailor your algorithm in new ways.\nAfter I pressed reset on Instagram, most of the targeted problematic content I used to see was gone. Instead, my Explore page was filled with generic Instagram trash. But I could see it trying to adapt pretty quickly, for example, offering up more dog content after I watched more dog videos. Instagram says you can send it signals for what kind of algorithm you would like by actively tapping like and watching certain content to the end. (You can also press reset again every time it starts to get annoying.)\nFor my friend with the racy Instagram feed, she still saw \u201cweirdly sex-oriented\u201d content recommended after pressing reset. It\u2019s possible that\u2019s because Instagram was basing her new algorithm on accounts she has followed that sometimes include that kind of content.\nA cynical point of view is that doing a reset allows the tech companies to become even better at preying on us, because they\u2019ll be able to test different algorithms on you.\nAlso know that a reset won\u2019t actually force Instagram to delete your old data \u2014 only deleting your whole account can do that. Nor will pressing the algorithm reset button do away with all of the data they use to target you with ads.\n\nFor YouTube, a reset involves deleting the history of videos you\u2019ve watched in the past. That\u2019s one of the major signals that YouTube uses to make future recommendations. You can even turn off your YouTube history going forward, so its algorithms won\u2019t have the data to try to interpret your interests.\nIf you\u2019re not ready to totally say goodbye to your algorithm, there may be other things you can do to tailor your experience. Many social media apps let you nip and tuck around the edges of your algorithm by tapping buttons to say you like or want to see more or less of certain topics. TikTok has a slider, in settings, to request more or less dance, fashion, nature or pets. On YouTube, if you click \u201clike\u201d on what you do like, its algorithms should listen. (Some people even turn shaping their algorithms into an art \u2014 there was <a href=\"https://x.com/old_ric/status/1875955842509635944\" target=_blank>one guy</a> who crafted an Instagram that recommends nothing but eggs.)\nIf, like me, what you really want is social media that features only the stuff you followed, you can kind of hack your way into it. There\u2019s another Instagram setting under \u201cContent preferences\u201d called \u201csnooze suggested posts in feed\u201d that tells the app to stop recommending content there for 30 days. You just have to keep going back to press it again every month. This, sadly, is what counts as putting users \u201cin control\u201d these days."

        "content": "Argentina will withdraw from the World Health Organization, a spokesman for President Javier Milei said Wednesday, just weeks after his ally, President Donald Trump, announced he would again pull out of the global health alliance.\nMilei instructed his foreign minister to leave the alliance due to \u201cprofound differences regarding health management, especially during the pandemic\u201d and \u201ca lack of independence from the political influence of some states,\u201d presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni said in a news conference Wednesday.\n\u201cArgentines are not going to allow an international organization to intervene in our sovereignty, much less in our health,\u201d Adorni said.\nThe move by South America\u2019s second-largest economy follows a Trump<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/\" target=\"_blank\"> executive order</a> that terminates the United States\u2019 commitment to the organization. Trump has accused the WHO of fueling the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\">coronavirus</a> pandemic that helped end his first presidency and  charged that it helped cover up the origins and spread of the virus.\nThe United States is responsible for nearly 20 percent of the WHO\u2019s funding. Public health experts warn that Trump\u2019s departure could cripple the organization\u2019s operations at a time when member nations are battling several dangerous outbreaks around the world and trying to stop the return of vaccine-preventable childhood diseases, such as measles. They also fear it could leave an opening for China to assume greater control over the agency that helps coordinate the response to international health crises, The Washington Post has<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/23/trump-world-health-organization/\" target=_blank> reported. </a>\nMilei, a libertarian economist whom Trump has called his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/20/trump-milei-argentina-similarities/\" target=_blank>favorite president</a>,\u201d is one of Trump\u2019s most important allies in Latin America.

        "headline": "At forum, Bowser won\u2019t rule out public funds for NFL stadium at RFK",
        "content": "On Thursday night, before a packed auditorium at Eastern Senior High School, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) made it clear once again: She wants the Washington Commanders to build its next NFL home at the site of RFK Stadium, and she\u2019s not ruling out a public subsidy to help them do it.\nBowser called a football stadium \u201cthe fastest and surest route to developing the site,\u201d a 177-acre swath of land on the banks of the Anacostia River that the city recently secured<b> </b>control of after years of negotiations in Congress.\n\u201cUntil we have a modern stadium, we will not be able to host events like the world is used to, including a World Cup, including a Super Bowl \u2014 and yes, Beyonc\u00e9<b> </b>and Taylor Swift,\u201d said Bowser.\nThe mayor\u2019s remarks came at her largest public forum on the RFK development since the city secured control of the federal<b> </b>land\u2019s destiny. The stadium was left to crumble for years because of a restrictive lease that did not allow commercial development \u2014 but after a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/12/25/rfk-stadium-bill-dc-bowser/\" target=_blank>Christmas miracle of sorts in Congress</a>, D.C. is permitted to develop<b> </b>the site for multiple uses.\nBowser said she plans to work with the Commanders, who now play in Landover, Maryland, to convince them D.C. is the best location and reach terms that she believes will benefit residents. Her administration will also propose plans for the rest of the site \u2014 which could include housing, a large indoor sportsplex run by the city\u2019s parks and recreation department, and other commercial development, Bowser said.<b> </b>Commanders principal owner Josh Harris has avoided expressing an outright preference for the new stadium location, which will likely go in D.C. or Maryland, but he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/21/commanders-rfk-stadium/\" target=_blank>called RFK the \u201cspiritual home\u201d</a> of the Commanders, took a photo with Bowser at the signing of the RFK bill at the White House, and has said D.C. is the most politically viable site.\nBut Bowser\u2019s vision is likely to face intense scrutiny from a divided D.C. Council and their constituents, who are not all convinced that an NFL stadium would be a good bet for city taxpayers. And in this case, city lawmakers have leverage: Any plan using public dollars will have to go through them. The question of whether taxpayer money will help fund a football stadium \u2014 and if so, how much \u2014 is shaping up to be one of<b> </b>this year\u2019s<b> </b>largest political battles in the District.\nThe line to get into Eastern snaked around the block as residents waited for the chance to hear the mayor make her case \u2014 and answer more than an hour\u2019s worth of their questions. People passed out fliers, printed with the words \u201cCOMMUNITY FIRST AT RFK\u201d and \u201cNO BILLIONAIRE\u2019S PLAYGROUND.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see a stadium,\u201d said Leslie Fields, 64, who has lived in D.C. for four decades. 'We\u2019ve got people sitting in the streets. There\u2019s a lot of things that we need to pay for. We don\u2019t have a billion dollars lying around.\u201d\nDuring her 20-minute presentation, Bowser argued that an NFL stadium \u2014 particularly one surrounded by housing, retail and other recreation opportunities \u2014 would<b> </b>bring jobs and tax revenue<b> </b>to the city. To support her argument, she cited a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/13/dc-sports-study-rfk-stadium-commanders/\" target=_blank>sports study she commissioned and released last year</a> that estimated more than $1 billion in annual economic output could come from a mixed-use development with an NFL stadium. She assured residents that she envisioned much more than football at the site. With a parcel of this size, she said,<b> </b>\u201cwe can indeed do it all.\u201d\nSome<b> </b>residents were all for it.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just build a stadium \u2014 Super Bowl status!\u201d one said.\nMany had more tempered enthusiasm or outright skepticism. Neighboring<b> </b>Kingman Park residents wanted assurances they would not be displaced from their homes; Bowser promised they would not. Others wanted guaranteed opportunities for small local business owners at the site, assurances that care would be taken to avoid negative environmental impacts and promises that city leaders would be thoughtful about traffic. Skateboarders asked to be considered, hoping they wouldn\u2019t be displaced from one of the few good places to skate in the city. A team of young pole-vaulting champions who practice nearby asked for the same.\nSeveral focused on parking. How much space would NFL stadium parking requirements actually eat up? While Bowser estimated a stadium would take up 20 to 25 acres, she would not provide an estimate for parking space.\nOthers focused on public funding. Why fund a stadium, they asked, when the city still struggles in some cases to deliver basic resident services?\nAsked by one man whether she would commit to not offering the NFL team a subsidy, Bowser\u2019s answer was unequivocal: \u201cNo.\u201d\nBowser\u2019s presentation did not offer details about how much public money she would be willing to offer the team, only saying that her administration\u2019s \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d found that a stadium would be a good investment. But some<b> </b>wanted more details about the mayor\u2019s economic argument, feeling uncertain that taxpayers would benefit.\nSome economists argue there is consensus that sports stadiums do not pay off for cities: One <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/13/dc-sports-study-rfk-stadium-commanders/\" target=_blank>told The Washington Post last year</a> that he did not even want to go into the specifics of Bowser\u2019s sports study \u201cbecause I fear going into the details grants some legitimacy to the idea that there is some debate over the economic impact of stadiums.\u201d\nLast year, a<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/05/22/commanders-stadium-rfk-site-poll/\" target=_blank> Washington Post-Schar School poll</a> found that 47 percent of D.C. residents were in favor of city funds being used for an NFL stadium and 46 percent were opposed.\nD.C. Council members<b> </b>are divided, too.\nWard 2 council member Brooke Pinto (D) is shaping up to be a Bowser ally on this issue: She said last week that it was time to bring the Commanders to D.C., and that she was open to all funding options to do so \u2014 including public funding.\nBut at least five of the council\u2019s 12 current lawmakers \u2014 Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Janeese Lewis George (D-Ward 4), Zachary Parker (D-Ward 5), Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) and Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) \u2014 say they would oppose taxpayers footing the bill for a stadium. Nadeau opposes a stadium entirely, a spokesperson confirmed last week. And Allen is heavily skeptical, arguing that an NFL stadium and parking would mean sacrificing additional housing and commercial space with higher potential for full-time, year-round jobs. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re having an honest conversation about what the trade-offs are,\u201d he said in an interview last week.\nFive council members \u2014 Kenyan R. McDuffie (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Christina Henderson (I-At Large), Matt Frumin (D-Ward 3) and Wendell Felder (D-Ward 7) \u2014 either declined to commit to a position on public financing or did not respond.\nRobert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) said in a statement Friday that he did not think D.C. taxpayers should foot the bill but that it would be \u201cpremature\u201d to comment on financing for a stadium until he has seen the mayor\u2019s full proposal.\nFelder, whose ward includes the RFK area, sat onstage next to Bowser at Thursday night\u2019s forum. He<b> </b>spoke about a stadium as a possible economic boon for his constituents but later said he needed to see specifics before he\u2019d decide whether taxpayer money should help fund one.\n\u201cI don\u2019t deal in hypotheticals; I need to see a proposal,\u201d he<b> </b>said as he left.\nPenn Branch resident<b> </b>Jimmie Williams said he was generally supportive of an NFL stadium coming to D.C. \u2014 noting that D.C.'s loss would be another jurisdiction\u2019s gain. But he wanted to make sure any stadium deal was done with care and an eye toward residents\u2019 concerns.\n\u201cThis is an economic benefit for D.C.,\u201d said Williams. \u201cBut it\u2019s got to be done right.\u201d\n<i>Sam Fortier contributed to this report.</i>"

Johnson urged GOP senators to \u201callow the House to do its work,\u201d as House Republicans fret that if they do not reach an agreement, the Senate will jam them with its fiscal and policy preferences.\n\u201cWe are moving this as quickly and as expeditiously as possible,\u201d he continued. \u201c \u2026 We\u2019re really grateful to the president for leaning in and doing what he does best, and that is put a steady hand at the wheel and get everybody working.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday afternoon that Trump outlined his tax priorities early in the meeting to lawmakers: eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security and overtime pay, as well as renewing individual portions of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which are<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/12/tcja-tax-cuts-expiration/\" target=_blank> set to expire at the end of 2025</a>.\nNonpartisan experts estimate that the initiatives proposed by Trump will lead to a $9 trillion increase in the national debt over 10 years, which rankles fiscal hawks demanding steeper cuts in negotiations."

The third order seeks to combat antisemitism in schools.\nFor years, Republicans including President Donald Trump have attacked schools for teaching a basket of ideas about systemic racism labeled critical race theory. Trump has also attacked schools for policies and lessons that recognize and respect transgender students.\nFederal law allows the agency to withhold federal funds from any school that discriminates based on race. Trump and his allies argue that lessons about systemic racism amount to discrimination, because they presume certain things about people based on race, such as that White Americans enjoy certain privileges based on their race. They say that giving rights to transgender students, especially transgender girls and women, discriminates against cisgender girls and women by forcing them to share spaces and sports teams.\nThe order also reinstates the<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/02/trump-1776-commission-education/\" target=_blank> 1776 Commission</a>, which Trump created just a week before the 2020 presidential election to promote \u201cpatriotic education.\u201d The commission wrote a report that was published in the final days of his first term. The report came under heavy fire from historians as a distortion of American history, and President Joe Biden disbanded the panel as one of his first acts. As a candidate, Trump promised to reinstate the commission if reelected.\n<i>Cleve R. Wootson Jr. contributed to this report.</i>"

The money also went to other development projects.\nAfter Ali issued his temporary restraining order, or TRO, requiring Trump officials to restart the aid on Feb. 13, the administration said it had authority under other statutes to continue much of the freeze.

Charles Q. Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and nominated in Brown\u2019s place a retired officer, Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, who possesses few of the qualifications detailed in U.S. law for the position.\nThe other senior officers who were abruptly dismissed on Friday include the head of the U.S. Navy, Adm. Lisa Franchetti; the No. 2 officer in the Air Force, Gen. James Slife; Hegseth\u2019s senior military assistant, Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short; and the top military lawyers for the Army, Navy and Air Force. The head of the Coast Guard, Adm. Linda Fagan, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/21/trump-coast-guard-linda-fagan/\" target=_blank>was fired</a> a day after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\nRetired military officers and experts on civil-military affairs have raised alarm about the firings, questioning whether Trump wants loyalists in uniform rather than nonpartisan officers. While the president is free to choose the generals he wants, they observed, the chairmanship and many other senior military positions are meant to bridge presidential administrations, providing continuity and expertise.\nDemocrats in Congress have said the Pentagon purge <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/21/trump-firings-generals-admirals/\" target=_blank>endangers national security</a>.\nCaine, a retired F-16 pilot and Special Operations commander in the National Guard, retired from the military in January and had moved on to a career in venture capitalism. Although he had a leadership role in the U.S. campaign against the Islamic State extremist group and later served as the senior military officer at the CIA, he has never been a service chief, Joint Chiefs vice chairman, or four-star general in charge of a combatant command.\nU.S. law states that a president may appoint an officer to the chairmanship \u201conly if\u201d they have held one of those jobs, though it notes the commander in chief can waive those requirements if he determines doing so is \u201cnecessary in the national interest.\u201d\nAfter Hegseth\u2019s terse response to the Reuters reporter drew attention on social media, he wrote on his official X account that Caine \u201cis the man to meet the moment! Full stop.\u201d\nHegseth, a former Fox News host, and his team at the Pentagon have taken an increasingly aggressive posture to outside scrutiny of their moves, launching a new rapid-response account on X over the weekend that has repeatedly attacked lawmakers and journalists who have questioned their decisions. A separate White House rapid-response account called the Reuters reporter, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/authors/idrees-ali/\" target=_blank>Idrees Ali</a>, a \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894134198811721922\" target=_blank>Fake News loser</a>.\u201d That post was shared by Hegseth with his personal account and by a political appointee at the Pentagon, the deputy press secretary Kingsley Wilson, on her official government account.\nA spokesman for Hegseth, Sean Parnell, said in a post on X that the question about Caine\u2019s qualifications was \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cdemeaning to an extraordinary leader.\n\u201cDan Caine is the right man &amp; leader for this moment &amp; any suggestion to the contrary is just unfair,\" Parnell said.\nAli referred questions to a spokesperson for Reuters. In a statement, the news organization said: \u201cThe question our reporter asked was timely and newsworthy.\u201d\nAdministration officials have defended the Pentagon firings by noting that other presidents have removed generals, pointing to the dismissals of Gen. Stanley McChrystal by President Barack Obama in 2010 and Gen. Douglas MacArthur in 1951 by President Harry S. Truman. In those cases, however, the presidents had proximate causes \u2014 McChrystal was fired after his staff disparaged Obama in an article published by Rolling Stone magazine, and MacArthur openly questioned Truman\u2019s strategy during the Korean War.\nThe Trump administration has offered no evidence of wrongdoing by the seven senior military leaders fired Friday, saying instead that the president wants officers more aligned with his vision.\nHegseth, speaking Sunday on Fox News, said that he has \u201ca lot of respect for CQ Brown,\u201d calling the general an \u201chonorable man\u201d who was \u201cnot the right man for the moment.\u201d Those remarks were in contrast to others Hegseth has made about Brown, whom he accused of being overly focused on diversity initiatives and had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/13/trump-charles-q-brown-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary/\" target=_blank>publicly mused about firing</a>.\n\u201cDan \u2018Razin\u2019 Caine is going to be a fantastic chairman,\u201d Hegseth said on Fox News. \u201cI look forward to working with him, and he will give straightforward advice, as he did to President Trump on the defeat of [the Islamic State].\u201d\nHegseth also has defended his decision to fire the top military lawyers in the Army, Navy and Air Force, saying in his interview Sunday that the administration wants lawyers who give \u201csound constitutional advice and don\u2019t exist to attempt to be roadblocks to anything.\u201d\nAsked by another reporter on Monday to explain how the fired military lawyers had presented roadblocks, Hegseth said it was \u201cnot about roadblocks to an agenda, it\u2019s roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.\u201d\n\u201cSo ultimately, I want the best possible lawyers in each service to provide the best possible recommendations, no matter what, to lawful orders that are given,\u201d Hegseth said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think those particular positions were well suited, and so we\u2019re looking for the best.

Some Trump administration officials, <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1888607143030391287\">including Vice President JD Vance</a>, have publicly questioned the authority of judges in response to recent rulings against some of the president\u2019s executive orders.\nThe administration on Wednesday was appealing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/usaid-aid-supreme-court-payment-deadline/\" target=\"_blank\">a looming court deadline</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/25/usaid-funding-trump-administration-court/\"> </a>to pay hundreds of millions in foreign assistance funds that have remained in limbo despite a judge\u2019s previous order.\n\n\u201cThere is no hard and fast rule in all instances in which a litigant must comply with all or some or various parts of a judicial decision,\u201d Reitz, who is currently chief of staff to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), told lawmakers at the hearing. \u201cIt is so fact-, law- and case-specific that one cannot speak generally.\u201d\nSauer, who has represented Trump in his previous criminal cases, said, \u201cGenerally, if there\u2019s a direct court order that binds a federal or state official, they should follow it.\u201d\nAs to whether Trump would defy a direct order, he said that having represented Trump for nearly two years, \u201cI just think that\u2019s not a plausible scenario.\u201d\nIn response to those answers, Kennedy offered a forceful directive to the president\u2019s nominees:\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever, ever take the position that you\u2019re not going to follow the order of a federal court \u2014 ever. Now, you can disagree with it within the bounds of legal ethics. You can criticize it. You can appeal it or you can resign,\u201d he said.

She, too, worked as one of Trump\u2019s private attorneys.\nSauer, who is nominated<b> </b>to serve as<b> </b>solicitor general,<b> </b>has already scored one landmark victory for Trump<b> </b>before the Supreme Court,<b> </b>winning a broad expansion of presidential immunity in Trump\u2019s election interference case.\nSen.

Michael Luttig, a former appeals court judge. He spent<b> </b>five years as a federal prosecutor before becoming the solicitor general of Missouri when the state attorney general\u2019s office was led by Josh Hawley and then Eric Schmitt \u2014 both of whom are now Republican U.S. senators from the state.\nThey had high praise for Sauer when they introduced him to the committee Wednesday. After he left the state attorney general\u2019s office, he opened<b> </b>a small law practice instead of joining a big firm.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think John wanted to be in a position where he couldn\u2019t do work that interested him because it conflicted with the business of the firm,\u201d said John Demers, who worked alongside Sauer as a co-clerk to Scalia and led the Justice Department\u2019s national security division in the first Trump administration. \u201cHe took cases he believed in, and he wanted to have the freedom to do them.\u201d\nIn addition to defending Trump personally, Sauer joined unsuccessful <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O155/163215/20201209144840609_2020-12-09%20-%20Texas%20v.%20Pennsylvania%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20Missouri%20et%20al.%20-%20Final%20with%20Tables.pdf\">efforts to try to overturn</a> the 2020 presidential election results and has a long track record of advocating for conservative causes.

He also said Sauer is<b> </b>\u201cnot the kind of lawyer who is going to try to dissuade his client from a position that he thinks might be a stretch or inconsistent with current law.\u201d\n\u201cJohn is not likely to be a roadblock to policy positions his clients want to take,\u201d said Hatfield, who earlier spent a decade working in the state attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cHe\u2019s more likely to be an advocate in favor of those positions \u2014 and a very good, a very smart one.\u201d\nIn Scalia\u2019s chambers, Sauer stood out for his wide-ranging knowledge, outstanding memory,<b> </b>and ability to talk about everything from pop culture to theology and philosophy.\n\u201cHe\u2019s never offensive, but he loves to argue,\u201d Demers said of Sauer\u2019s style. \u201cHe argues on the substance; it\u2019s not an argument about who can raise their voice louder.\u201d\nIn the days before<b> </b>Trump\u2019s return to the White House, Sauer continued to represent him at the Supreme Court. He tried unsuccessfully to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/09/trump-sentencing-supreme-court-new/\">delay Trump\u2019s sentencing</a> in New York for his hush money conviction<b> </b>and <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-656/336151/20241227163400981_2024-12-27%20-%20TikTok%20v.%20Garland%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20President%20Donald%20J.%20Trump.pdf\">filed an unusual brief</a> seeking an opportunity for Trump<b> </b>to negotiate a deal to prevent TikTok, the video-sharing app, from going dark.\n\u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government,\u201d Sauer wrote. The brief was<b> </b>criticized by the Wall Street Journal editorial page and others for not staking out a legal position and suggesting that there could be more than one president at a time.\nSauer\u2019s most high-profile role came last year, when he asked the Supreme Court to rule that Trump \u2014 accused in D.C. federal court of trying to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory \u2014 should be broadly protected from prosecution for his official actions while in the White House.\nIn response to a hypothetical question from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Sauer suggested that it could be an official action, and therefore immune, if a president <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2023/23-939_3fb4.pdf\">ordered the military to assassinate a political rival</a>.\nThe high court\u2019s conservative supermajority ruled in favor of Trump, saying that a president\u2019s official actions could not be prosecuted, though his<b> </b>private conduct<b> </b>could be.\nLuttig, who has become an outspoken Trump critic, said his former law clerk is intellectually honest and has great integrity. While Luttig disagreed with the court\u2019s<b> </b>immunity ruling, he said Sauer made the only possible argument that could save Trump from criminal prosecution.\n\u201cA man who can convince the Supreme Court that the Constitution affords the President of the United States absolute immunity can convince the Supreme Court the Constitution means anything he wants,\u201d Luttig said. \u201cThat the Supreme Court bought the fallacious argument hook, line and sinker was not to Mr. Sauer\u2019s discredit. It was to the Supreme Court\u2019s discredit.\u201d\nAll three nominees seemed to have the support they would need from Republicans to advance to the full Senate.\nAs head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, Dhillon would oversee an office whose work<b> </b>traditionally has included<b> </b>investigating police misconduct, enforcing voting rights and filing<b> </b>cases over<b> </b>alleged civil rights<b> </b>violations.\nIf confirmed, she would be the first Sikh American to hold the position.\nDhillon<b> </b>has previously garnered attention for her legal work targeting social media companies, challenging corporate diversity policies, and suing over California\u2019s pandemic restrictions.\nReitz, a Marine Corps veteran who previously worked for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), would oversee a Justice Department office tasked with advising the attorney general on policy and assisting in the selection of nominees for the federal bench.\nDemocrats repeatedly confronted him Wednesday with his past posts on the social media site X, many of which have been deleted. One post from March 2020 responded to a ruling from U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel temporarily blocking Texas from closing an abortion clinic during the covid pandemic.\n\u201cJudge Yeakal has made his decision. Now let him enforce it,\u201d Reitz wrote, echoing an apocryphal quote attributed to Andrew Jackson in response to a much earlier court ruling.\nHe was asked at multiple points during Wednesday\u2019s hearing to commit to the concept that even the president should be bound by adverse court rulings. Reitz repeatedly resisted giving a firm answer.\n\u201cMy position reflects a fairly mainstream view within right-of-center jurisprudential circles, which is simply to suggest that various Supreme Court or Court of Appeals decisions are more limited in scope than maybe our friends who share a different jurisprudential view of Supreme Court holdings would suggest,\u201d he said.\nSen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) pushed back. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving me great confidence by not stating unequivocally that we are a<b> </b>nation that respects the separation of powers, the role of the courts and \u2026 the traditions of the country,\u201d he said.\n<i>Razzan Nakhlawi contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to remove Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and create a real estate \u201criviera\u201d on the eastern Mediterranean has spurred a regional scramble for an alternative, with Arab leaders working on a proposal that aims to pump billions of dollars in reconstruction money into the enclave, according to people familiar with the planning.\nLeaders from Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar met in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Friday to thrash out details less than three weeks after Trump laid out a plan <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/trump-netanyahu-meeting/\" target=_blank>for the United States to \u201ctake over\u201d Gaza</a> and displace the population there, a proposal that has been broadly condemned as tantamount to ethnic cleansing.\nThe emerging Arab plan would call for Palestinian technocrats to govern Gaza and the provision of substantial funds to rebuild the shattered enclave, where the vast majority of the population of 2 million has been left homeless, according to five people with knowledge of the discussions.\nAnd while details of the plan are still being hashed out, they say there is resounding unanimity on one issue: Palestinians should not be displaced.\n\u201cThe Trump proposal is so outlandish and offensive to many in the Middle East that certainly it\u2019s a nonstarter. It\u2019s a hot mess,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), who has discussed plans with regional leaders including Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, whom Blumenthal met in the Jordanian Red Sea resort of Aqaba this week.\n\u201cThe Arab plan will seek to present a realistic proposal for reconstruction in Gaza without forced evacuation and without a United States takeover,\u201d Blumenthal said in a telephone interview.\nThe broad strokes of the Arab plan \u2014 hoped to be<b> </b>finalized ahead of an emergency summit with representatives of the broader 22-member Arab League on March 4 \u2014 are \u201cbecoming clearer,\u201d Blumenthal said. But significant hurdles remain, including reaching Arab consensus and<b> </b>obtaining U.S. and Israeli buy-in, he added.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel is \u201ccommitted\u201d to Trump\u2019s plan and described it as a \u201cbold vision\u201d for Gaza. The proposal has also received rapturous approval from the country\u2019s far-right politicians, who have pushed for Israeli settlements in Gaza and the enclave\u2019s annexation.\nBut Arab states are hoping to garner backing for their plan with their checkbooks. A new assessment by the United Nations estimates that it could cost $50 billion to rebuild Gaza after the devastation caused by 15 months of war.\nThe exact figure to be put forward is \u201cstill up for review,\u201d but the proposal is likely to include a headline number, said Emirati academic Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a visiting fellow at Harvard University.\n\u201cThe number is important because they know the president of the United States is transactional, he likes numbers, and they think he might be swayed when he sees these billions of dollars,\u201d including construction opportunities for U.S. companies,<b> </b>he said.\nEgyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said this week that regional construction firms, including those in Egypt, have the capacity to build 300,000 housing units over a three-year period.\nOther proposals being considered appear aimed at keeping Trump\u2019s interest in investment at the heart of Gaza\u2019s future. One, from the Al Habtoor Group, an Emirati conglomerate, <a href=\"https://www.alhabtoorgroup.com/gaza/Gaza-Reconstruction-Plan.pdf\" target=_blank>outlines a phased approach</a> that would establish security in the territory and transition emergency housing into redevelopment over 18 months.\nArab countries know they hold leverage by being \u201cthe ATMs\u201d for reconstruction, said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. However, the \u201cclash of worldviews,\u201d between Israel and Trump on one side and the region on the other, remains a major sticking point, he said.\nDuring his trip to Washington this month, Netanyahu looked on smiling as Trump outlined his plans for a U.S. \u201ctakeover\u201d of Gaza. \u201cThe big impediment is if the whole exercise will be accepted by Trump, and certainly big questions over whether it will be accepted by the current Israeli government,\u201d Katulis said of the Arab plan.\nPhase one of the Arab plan envisages reconstruction in areas that have not been completely obliterated, but Arab leaders are willing to open their wallets only if other political and security elements of a plan are put in place, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who has recently met with ministers from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan to discuss evolving plans. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balancing act because all these three pieces need to converge,\u201d he said.\nThe technocratic committee envisioned for Gaza under the Arab plan would not include Hamas, the ruler of Gaza for almost two decades and architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\u201cThe two main driving principles on the governance side is that Hamas will have no governing role in Gaza, and also that it creates a political unity with the West Bank,\u201d said Van Hollen, adding that Arab states want the Palestinian Authority, the governing entity in the West Bank, to have some degree of sign-off on the structure.\nArab leaders, like previous U.S. administrations, have long advocated a clear path to a two-state solution, which Netanyahu has repeatedly opposed, along with any rule by the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.\n\u201cSquaring that circle is a big challenge at this point,\u201d Van Hollen said.\nTwo officials briefed on the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive proposals that are still in flux, emphasized that the technocratic government is intended to be a \u201ctemporary\u201d body to oversee rebuilding and would remain in place only until elections could be held.\nWhile many officials in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, and in Riyadh remain frustrated that they were not informed before Trump floated the Gaza displacement plan, they also acknowledge that the U.S. leader\u2019s approach has succeeded in motivating the Arab states to act, according to the officials.\n\u201cTrump scrambled the table, and it forced other people to start doing some of the heavy lifting,\u201d said one individual familiar with the thinking of the regional leadership. Others in the region draw parallels to Trump\u2019s comments on Ukraine that spurred emergency meetings of leaders in Europe.\nBut Van Hollen said he also fears that Trump\u2019s plan has set back the chances of making a deal. \u201cIn addition to being outrageous on its face, it\u2019s further emboldened the far right and made it more difficult to achieve an overall settlement,\u201d he said.\nHamas\u2019s objections are another potential spoiler to any plan, as is the thorny question of who will provide security in Gaza. Hamas still holds weapons stockpiles, while the security vacuum has led to a rise in criminal gangs.\n\u201cThere is still a very challenging and complicated road ahead, even if Arab leaders present a realistic plan,\u201d said Blumenthal, adding that Abdullah has been \u201cvery clear-eyed and realistic\u201d in his thinking.\nBut while the gaps remain wide, both Trump and Netanyahu want a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and also to maintain a regional coalition against Iran as Israel mulls <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/12/israel-iran-us-intelligence/\" target=_blank>strikes against Tehran\u2019s nuclear program</a>.\n\u201cThere is a golden opportunity for Israel to integrate with the region and recognize its wildest dreams,\u201d said Katulis.\nWhile Trump\u2019s initial proposal to empty Gaza of its inhabitants sparked anger in Saudi Arabia, the close ties between the two powers were on full display this week.\nTrump made an appearance at a Saudi investment summit in Miami after tapping Riyadh to host talks to end the war in Ukraine. The coverage in Saudi media was glowing. Saudi Arabia \u201chas achieved success on all fronts,\u201d proclaimed a column in Asharq al-Awsat by Tariq Alhomayed, the newspaper\u2019s former editor.\nSpeaking at the summit in Miami on Thursday, Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, addressed Gaza and appeared to dial back elements of the president\u2019s plan that had caused alarm, saying some of Trump\u2019s comments had been misconstrued.\nThe level of destruction is so great, a five-year development plan \u201cis not physically possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we are on an eviction plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means the president wants to shake up everybody\u2019s thinking.\u201d\nWitkoff said Arab leaders are now considering new solutions for rebuilding Gaza, ideas that \u201cpeople would have never considered, and I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n<i>Abigail Hauslohner in Washington contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration is close to canceling a $2.4 billion contract to overhaul a communications system that serves as the backbone of the nation\u2019s air traffic control system and awarding the work to Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink, according to two people briefed on the plans.\nThe move to cancel a major contract in favor of a venture led by Musk \u2014 who is leading<b> </b>President Donald Trump\u2019s disruptive<b> </b>overhaul of the federal government through the U.S. DOGE Service \u2014 would represent a significant test of protections against conflicts of interest in government projects. It would be an especially extraordinary step for the typically cautious FAA, whose systems are vital to the safety of millions of air travelers every day.\nThe existing contract was awarded to Verizon in 2023, with the aim of upgrading a platform that different air traffic control facilities and FAA offices use to communicate with one another.\nMusk has personally taken aim at Verizon on his social media platform X in recent days, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1894202642639061144\" target=_blank>saying on Monday</a>: \u201cThe Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.\u201d\nVerizon did not respond to a request for comment. Joseph Russo, a Verizon executive vice president, said at an event hosted by Barclays Bank on Tuesday that Starlink\u2019s efforts at FAA might be complementary to Verizon\u2019s. Verizon was offering the \u201creliability and performance\u201d that the FAA needed, and its system was expected to be operational soon, Russo said.\nThe FAA said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cno decisions have been made\u201d about the Verizon project.\nA team of employees from SpaceX, Starlink\u2019s parent company, has been working inside the FAA in recent days, charged by the Trump administration with helping modernize the agency\u2019s aging technology. Ted Malaska, one of them, shared a<a href=\"https://x.com/TedMalaska/status/1892705202576277926\" target=_blank> picture on X on Thursday</a> saying he was excited to be working with the FAA, and thanking Musk and Trump for their \u201cvision and focus on safety.\u201d\n\u201cI challenge anyone to question the honesty and my technical integrity on this matter,\u201d Malaska <a href=\"https://x.com/TedMalaska/status/1894787084663300535\" target=_blank>posted Wednesday</a>. \u201cI am working without biases for the safety of people that fly.\u201d\nSeveral of the SpaceX employees now have FAA email addresses, according to two people who have seen the addresses, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. FAA regulates SpaceX and has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/17/faa-spacex-fine-elon-musk-regulation/\" target=_blank>alleged</a> that the company has violated safety rules relating to its rocket launches.\nIn a statement Monday, the FAA said it was testing Starlink systems at facilities in New Jersey and Alaska, in hopes of providing more reliable connectivity in remote locations. Elements of the FAA\u2019s deliberations were previously reported by the Associated Press and Bloomberg News.\nTransportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369262913112\" target=_blank>on Fox News this week</a> that the government had been too slow to modernize its technology and that the new administration was ready to move quickly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at a year, year-and-a-half time frame and do massive upgrades, improve the systems, help air traffic controllers, keep our skies safer,\u201d Duffy said.\nBut the Starlink plan adds to Musk\u2019s existing conflicts of interest at the FAA relating to SpaceX, according to John P. Pelissero, the director of an ethics center at Santa Clara University.\nPelissero said it appears that \u201cbecause of Musk\u2019s current position in DOGE and his closeness to Trump he and his company are getting an advantage and getting a contract.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s looking out for the public interest here when you get the person who\u2019s cutting budgets and personnel from the FAA, suddenly trying to benefit from still another government contract?\u201d Pelissero said.\nThe Transportation Department, DOGE and SpaceX did not respond to questions on how the process of changing contractors has been handled and whether potential conflicts of interest have been reviewed. Trump has said Musk will not be permitted to participate in decisions that pose a conflict of interest.\nVerizon was tapped in 2023 to build a system called the FAA Enterprise Network Services Program or FENS, replacing a system that dates to 2002. The contract had a 15-year lifespan, and the system is intended to connect some 4,600 sites, according to the FAA.\nThe agency was scheduled to make a final decision on whether<b> </b>to start paying Verizon for the contract next month, said one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\nInstead, Musk\u2019s team determined the job should go to Starlink, the person said. But the process for unwinding a contract and awarding it to another company is lengthy and has not been followed in this case so far, the person said.\nSeveral senior FAA officials have refused to sign paperwork authorizing the switch,<b> </b>according to the person, who has been briefed on the internal deliberations and resulting fallout, so Musk\u2019s team is now seeking help from the acting administrator of the agency, Trump appointee Chris Rocheleau, and Duffy.\nOutside reviews of the FAA\u2019s technology have repeatedly concluded in recent years that it is woefully out of date and that the agency is too slow to make upgrades. A 2023 <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/NAS_safety_review_team_report.pdf\" target=_blank>safety review pointed to technological problems</a> as one factor that was creating \u201crisk\u201d in the aviation system, a problem the Verizon contract is supposed to help solve.\nJessica Tillipman, the associate dean for government and procurement law studies at George Washington University School of Law, said terminating a contract can be expensive, time consuming and could lead to litigation.\n\u201cWhen the government terminates a contract it\u2019s not like it shuts off the spigot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive to wind down a contract. It\u2019s very expensive and it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\nShe said negotiating a settlement can take a year.\nIn awarding a new contract, agencies must comply with the Competition and Contracting Act, which requires competition in government procurements. It does have some exceptions. Among those: national security, public interest or urgency, she said.\n\u201cBut the question is, how is it so urgent when you already had a contractor dealing with it?,\u201d said Tillipman, adding that there are many different guardrails within the federal acquisition system to make sure things are fair, transparent and efficient.\n\u201cHowever, in the last few weeks she said many of these guardrails have been tested, which will likely lead to litigation,\u201d she said.\n<i>Washington Post researcher Aaron Schaffer contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis remained in critical condition Monday as the Vatican held the first nightly rosary recitation in St. Peter\u2019s Square, underscoring concern over the 88-year-old pontiff\u2019s health.\nThere was some measure of positivity Monday night. The Vatican said that Francis, who has been suffering from double pneumonia, showed \u201ca slight improvement\u201d over the course of the day and after a restful night. He had no further asthmatic episodes, and some laboratory tests had improved, it said.\nAs thousands of people converged on St. Peter\u2019s Square, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican\u2019s secretary of state, called on prayer to support Francis \u201cin this moment of illness and trial and help him to recover his health soon.\u201d\nVatican officials said this was the first time in their recollection that a special saying of the rosary had been held for Francis. Under a steady drizzle, priests, nuns, religious pilgrims and Romans recited the rosary inside the colonnaded square. Cardinals and senior clerics sat at the top of the stairs in front of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The altar consisted of a gold-framed depiction of the Virgin Mary cast against the evening darkness under a white canopy.\nAttendees were somber as they prayed, some visibly moved.\n\u201cThe pope is the most important person in the world for us,\u201d said Wiestow Piosecki, 43, an IT specialist from eastern Poland. He brought his wife and three children to Rome for the jubilee and were devastated when the pope fell ill. \u201cHis voice is important, especially with the war in Ukraine. I feel afraid now, afraid he may die. I feel my prayer can help.\u201d\n\nDue to the complexity of his clinical picture, the pope\u2019s doctors at Rome\u2019s Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital were still not prepared to offer a prognosis. In the morning, Francis received Holy Communion, and he worked in the afternoon and was eating solid food.<b> </b>In the evening, he called the parish priest in Gaza whom he has spoken with almost daily throughout the war to offer his \u201cpaternal closeness.\u201d Francis, the Vatican said, also offered thanks to those who have gathered in recent days to pray for his health.\nA mild renal insufficiency disclosed on Sunday, the Vatican said, was not \u201ccause for concern.\u201d The pope\u2019s oxygen therapy continued, although with slightly reduced flows and percentage of oxygen.\nFrancis\u2019s health crisis stretched into the end of its 10th day, making this the longest of his four hospitalizations as pope. Some senior clerics spoke in stark terms over the weekend about his chances. The hospital chaplain said Monday that it was time \u201cto hope against hope.\u201d\nIn recent days, Catholic churches around the globe, including in Francis\u2019s native Argentina, have prayed for the first New World pontiff. On Sunday, Cardinal Baldassare Reina, the vicar general of the Diocese of Rome, held a Mass for the pope, while encouraging other pastors in the diocese to do the same.\nThe saying of the rosary during a papal health crisis is seen as a spiritual gesture to pray for an especially ailing pope. In 2005, Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, then the undersecretary of state for the Vatican, announced the death of John Paul II to the crowds gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square after they finished saying the rosary for him.\nGiovanni Maria Vian, a former editor of the Vatican\u2019s newspaper and a historian of early Christianity, said the St. Peter\u2019s event on Monday night for Francis also reminded him of a saying of the rosary before the passing of Pope John XXIII in 1963.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure numberless such rosaries have been said at Gemelli,\u201d he said. \u201cThis [event] feels closer to the prayers in St. Peter\u2019s Square when [John Paul II] and [John XXIII] were dying, back in 2005 and 1963. I was there as a boy, and later [as an adult].\u201d\nIn the upper echelons of the Roman Catholic Church, speculating on the health of a pope has long been delicate terrain. But some senior clerics have offered surprisingly candid assessments. On Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/nyc-archbishop-timothy-dolan-worries-about-health-pope-francis-says-its-not-looking-good\" target=\"_blank\">Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York said, </a>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be kind of realistic. \u2026 It\u2019s not looking good.\u201d\nFrancis\u2019s doctors have sought to convey more optimism, suggesting his life is only at risk if he develops serious complications.\nTalk of his condition is partly due to the pope\u2019s own quest for transparency. His doctors say he has insisted on offering only the \u201ctruth\u201d to the public, and the extent of the medical disclosures has been unusual for the Vatican, which is traditionally guarded about a sitting pope\u2019s health.\nFrancis was admitted to the hospital with a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/17/pope-francis-illness-vatican-hospital/\" target=_blank>respiratory tract infection</a> on Feb. 14.\nLate Tuesday, the Vatican said CAT scans had revealed the pope to have double pneumonia. Chest X-rays showed he had developed a polymicrobial infection that arose from asthmatic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, a condition in which the airways widen, leading to a buildup of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. It said he was undergoing a \u201ccomplex\u201d treatment using antibiotic cortisone therapy.\nOn Saturday, the Vatican acknowledged in a written bulletin that Francis was in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/22/pope-francis-critical-asthma/\" target=_blank>critical condition</a>.\u201d It added that he had suffered a \u201cprolonged asthmatic crisis\u201d and a low platelet count. He was alert and sitting in an armchair, it said, but suffering more pain than the day before.\nIn a Sunday evening update, the Vatican said the pope\u2019s condition remained \u201ccritical\u201d but that there had been no recurrence of the respiratory crisis. He received treatment to boost his red blood cells. Blood tests showed \u201cmild\u201d renal insufficiency but that it was \u201cunder control.\u201d The pope, officials said, continued to receive high-flow oxygen through a nasal tube.\nCardinal Gianfranco Ravasi marveled at the level of detail being released about a pope\u2019s health. He told Corriere della Sera last week: \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how his conditions have been clearly explained. There used to be a tendency to conceal things related to the [the pope], like the Soviet bulletins in which the secretary had but a cold until he died. Now we go into detail. The \u2018polymicrobial infection.\u2019 The \u2018bilateral pneumonia.\u2019\u201d"

        "headline": "Trump ramps up ICE arrests, alarming cities and immigrant communities",
        "content": "The deportation blitz President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail kicked off in U.S. cities this week, delighting many of his supporters and jolting communities where immigration officers appeared \u2014 or whose arrival was merely rumored, sending a chill nonetheless.\nTrump\u2019s executive orders have given immigration officers extraordinary new powers to cast a wider net and fast-track deportations. The president has scrapped restrictions that kept \u201csensitive\u201d locations like churches and schools off-limits for immigration officers. Social media posts and school mailing lists have lit up with possible officer sightings, including many false alarms.\nThe number of suspects arrested \u2014 several hundred per day nationwide<b> </b>\u2014 has been outpaced by the psychological impact of the attention on ICE operations.\nIn Boston, a Fox News crew broadcast<b> </b>live as officers knocked on doors and pulled suspects from homes. In other cities where ICE netted a smattering of arrests, immigrant advocacy groups and Democratic representatives denounced \u201craids\u201d that gave an impression of something larger. Chicago officials said ICE officers tried to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/01/24/immigration-ice-agents-visit-chicago-school/\" target=_blank>access an elementary school</a>, but the agency said it wasn\u2019t true.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going very well. We\u2019re getting the bad, hard criminals out,\u201d Trump said, speaking to reporters during a trip to North Carolina to view the flood recovery from Hurricane Helene.\nWithout evidence, he said: \u201cThese are murderers. These are people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as anybody you\u2019ve seen. We\u2019re taking them out first.\u201d\nIt is a sharp break from the Biden administration, which protected most undocumented immigrants from being deported and welcomed thousands of temporary new arrivals via a program called parole. This week the top Department of Homeland Security official issued a memo directing agents to consider swiftly deporting people the Biden administration allowed to enter.\nThe Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants waiting in Mexico to request asylum through the CBP One mobile app. Trump\u2019s efforts are likely to face legal challenges, but lawyers say immigrants are not entitled to public defenders and therefore will have a difficult time defending themselves in a fast-track process, especially if they are detained. Earlier in the week, Trump officials abruptly halted some contracts that provided legal guidance to detainees.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday night that ICE had made 538 arrests that day, and officials said Friday they arrested 593 more. She wrote that four of those arrested in the sweeps were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Others had committed sex crimes against children, Leavitt said.\nLeavitt posted photos Friday showing U.S. troops loading shackled detainees onto a military cargo plane for a flight to Guatemala.\n\u201cThe largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway,\u201d Leavitt wrote on X on Thursday.\n\u201cDeportation flights have begun. President Trump is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: if you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences,\u201d Leavitt later added.\nThe military flew two C-17 cargo planes, each carrying approximately 80 people, to Guatemala after they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, according to a DHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operations. The flights departed from Texas and Arizona, officials said. ICE Air is continuing to operate deportation flights alongside military planes, officials said.\nTom Cartwright, who tracks ICE deportations for the immigrant advocacy group Witness at the Border, called the military operation \u201ctheater of the absurd\u201d in a post on X. \u201cThe only thing new about this is subjecting people to transport on a cargo plane,\u201d Cartwright wrote. He noted that ICE carried out 508 deportation flights to Guatemala during the 2024 fiscal year on planes that averaged 125 passengers.\nTrump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan cited a higher number of ICE arrests<b> </b>than the White House on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73h1iNQ8XRk\" target=_blank>NewsNation</a> on Thursday night, saying officials had apprehended more than 3,000 people with criminal records in the first couple days of the administration. ICE, which detains and deports immigrants, did not respond to requests to clarify the numbers.\nTrump and his officials provided few details about those arrests or proof of their criminal records. Trump has long characterized immigrants as criminals, though studies show that native-born Americans commit a higher share of violent felonies.\nImmigration officials did not say precisely how many immigrants were deported as part of the nationwide operations that unfolded this week \u2014 or how many were criminals \u2014 but officials have said their main targets are serious offenders.\nTrump also conducted raids at the start of his first term, and had threatened to deport \u201cmillions\u201d of people, though he never came close to that number.\nThen, as now, officials said criminals were their top priority. Weeks later, however, congressional aides <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/ice-data-shows-half-of-immigrants-arrested-in-raids-had-traffic-convictions-or-no-record/2017/04/28/81ff7284-2c59-11e7-b605-33413c691853_story.html\" target=_blank>discovered </a>that half of those arrested had no criminal convictions or had committed traffic offenses as their most serious crimes, which ICE said were mostly for drunken driving.\nThe immigration sweeps hit immediately after Trump took office in cities and states across the country, targeting areas where Democrats have defended immigrants and urged Congress to grant them a path to U.S. citizenship. Trump has called for their mass removal, and on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/20/trump-immigration-executive-orders/\" target=_blank>Inauguration Day </a>he directed the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense to prioritize immigration enforcement.\nHoman, a former acting ICE director and Fox News analyst, said in an appearance Thursday on Fox News that agents were arresting people in sanctuary cities, where local officials refuse to allow agents to arrest immigrants in their jails after police have picked them up for alleged crimes.\nMany local officials say they cannot keep someone in jail for a civil immigration violation after a judge has ordered the person released on bail in a criminal case. And some have expressed frustration that ICE targets minor offenders, making the broader community afraid to report crimes to police.\nTrump officials have called for rescinding federal funding to those cities and have threatened to prosecute any officials who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/22/justice-immigrantion-memo-sanctuary-cities/\" target=_blank>obstruct </a>immigration officers.\n\u201cSanctuary cities make it less efficient and more dangerous, but it\u2019s not going to stop us,\u201d Homan <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6367588473112\" target=_blank>said</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re hitting every sanctuary city right now.\u201d\nActing Homeland Security secretary Benjamine C. Huffman on Jan. 20 rescinded a directive that discouraged ICE from making arrests in sensitive areas such as churches or schools. He also ended the broad use of humanitarian parole, which President Joe Biden used to admit thousands of temporary migrants from Cuba, Haiti and other countries.\nOn Thursday, Huffman went further, directing immigration officials to consider stripping an undetermined number of migrants of parole and placing them in fast-track removal proceedings. Huffman declared that there was a \u201cmass influx\u201d of migrants at the southern border, despite a sharp reduction in apprehensions in recent months.\nUnless they are \u201cclearly\u201d eligible to enter, Huffman said all migrants should be detained until they are deported or granted asylum.\nIn Newark, Mayor Ras A. Baraka said Thursday that ICE raided a local business, detaining undocumented residents and U.S. citizens \u201cwithout producing a warrant.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned,\u201d the mayor said in a statement. He said federal agents violated the veteran\u2019s rights. \u201cNewark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,\u201d Baraka added.\nICE declined to provide detailed answers about the allegations, saying the investigation is ongoing.\nBut spokesman Jeff Carter said in an email that agents \u201cmay encounter U.S. citizens while conducting field work and may request identification to establish an individual\u2019s identity,\u201d which is what happened in Newark.\nICE has arrested immigrants, particularly criminals, across every administration, and the Biden administration boasted that it was aggressively pursuing serious offenders. Days before  Biden left office, <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ero-newark-arrests-33-criminal-noncitizens-week-long-surge-operation\" target=\"_blank\">ICE said it had arrested 33 criminal noncitizens</a> in a week-long operation in December, also in Newark.\nAs of July 21, ICE said it was tracking nearly 650,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal records who had been released into the United States, though only 425,000 had convictions. The others were pending trial.\nMany are serving criminal sentences in state prisons or jails, while others are minor offenders who had been spared removal under the Biden administration. Trump has said any of the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the United States illegally could be deported.\nIn the D.C. area, the volunteer group Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network launched a hotline Monday for area residents to call if they believe they see ICE officers in public. The group has not confirmed any wide-scale raids or enforcement actions this week, but the phones have kept ringing, said Amy Fischer, one of the group\u2019s organizers.\n\u201cWhat is really clear is that people are just terrified,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cIt really seems like any time there is an unmarked cop car or something that looks like a cop car, people call. \u2026 It describes the overall moment or atmosphere that we are living in.\u201d\nIn Montgomery County, Maryland, county officials said ICE agents arrested an immigrant with a felony in Gaithersburg on Thursday. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for information about the arrest, but it sparked fears of broader immigration sweeps at a local shopping center and high school. Similar rumors have swept across the county since Trump took office.\nSome residents have confused local law enforcement for ICE agents, said Earl Stoddard, an assistant chief administrative officer in Montgomery County, a sign of locals\u2019 anxieties that their neighborhood could be the agency\u2019s next target.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been every day this week,\u201d Stoddard said Thursday. \u201cPeople calling in worrying about ICE. This was the first time it was real.\u201d\n<i>Jacqueline Alemany, Arelis R. Hern\u00e1ndez, Sarah Cahlan and Dan Lamothe contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "On the night of Jan. 29, an Army Black Hawk helicopter <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/01/30/dc-plane-crash-deaths-survivors-potomac-reagan-airport/\">collided</a> with an American Airlines passenger jet over the Potomac River in Washington, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/interactive/2025/dca-plane-crash-victims-list-profiles/\">killing all 67 people</a> on both aircraft.\nAviation experts have since raised the possibility that, after being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/01/31/audio-air-traffic-control-dc-plane-crash/\">alerted</a> by air traffic <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/30/dc-plane-crash-helicopter-recovery-no-survivors-potomac-river/\">controllers</a> to the presence of the jet, the helicopter crew might have mistaken that plane for another<b> </b>incoming jet in the distance.\nTo analyze this theory, The Washington Post made a 3D model, using <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/30/videos-photos-dc-plane-crash-potomac-river/\">flight data</a> and air traffic control transmissions, and conducted interviews with five former Black Hawk pilots to recreate the view the crew likely had from inside the helicopter cockpit.\nOur examination shows how the American Airlines jet and the second plane, though separated by miles, would have appeared close to one another near the horizon and the helicopter crew could have confused the two jets when the tower first warned of incoming air traffic. The examination further shows how around a minute later, as viewed from the helicopter cockpit, the lights of the incoming American Airlines jet could have been obscured by the glow of the city skyline, allowing the jet to go undetected.\nThe causes of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/31/dc-plane-crash-happened-potomac-river/\">crash</a> remain under investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board has said the helicopter was flying above its mandated 200-foot ceiling and that its crew was likely wearing night vision goggles, which pilots said can complicate the task of tracking other aircraft.\nAt 8:46 p.m. the Black Hawk was flying south along the Potomac and the American Airlines jet was heading north on approach for landing at <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/30/reagan-airport-airspace-plane-crash-washington-dc/\">Reagan National Airport</a>.\n\n\n1 minute 58 seconds until impact\nAir traffic control alerts the helicopter to the presence of a CRJ, a type of regional jet. The plane is bound for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/02/04/dca-close-calls-plane-collisions-history/\">a runway</a> that will bring it close to the helicopter corridor along the river. \u201c<i>Traffic just south of the Wilson Bridge is a CRJ at 1,200 feet for Runway 33.\u201d</i>\n1 minute 52 seconds until impact\nA member of the Black Hawk crew responds by requesting \u201cvisual separation\u201d \u2014 an acknowledgment that it has the jet in sight and will take steps to avoid it, according to aviation experts.<b> </b>The controller immediately grants the request.\n\nAround seven miles away from the helicopter is <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark>, the CRJ. This is the plane that will later collide with the helicopter.\nA second<b> </b>jet, <u>AA 5307,</u> is about to touch down<b> </b>on Runway 1.\nAnd traveling a little more than three miles<b> </b>directly behind <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark>, a third jet, <u>AA 3130,</u> is beginning its approach to the same runway.\nAt this distance, <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark> and <u>AA 3130</u> appear nearly aligned, the 3D model shows. Some pilots said variations in the brightness of the planes\u2019 lights could have helped the helicopter crew distinguish the aircraft. Other pilots said the two planes may have been hard to tell apart or appeared as one light, especially if the crew was wearing night vision goggles.\nThe UH-60L Black Hawk does not come with<b> </b>a radar screen that shows other aircraft traffic, an Army official said. It is common for helicopter crews to use iPads with an app that can track flights, though it is unclear if the crew was using one.\n\nAt this point, both the helicopter crew and air traffic controllers believe that the two aircraft have been safely directed, the transmissions indicate.\nWhat follows, pilots told The Post, is an opportunity for the <b>helicopter crew</b> to identify <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark>. The jet becomes visibly distinct as it peels away from the line of other inbound planes, veering east following the standard approach path for Runway 33.\nBut if the <b>helicopter crew</b> fails to do so before the jet passes over the city, it will soon be increasingly difficult for them to realize their potential error, pilots said.\nAbout a minute before impact, <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark> continues to curve east and north, away from the Potomac and over D.C.\n1 minute until impact\nFrom the helicopter crew\u2019s perspective, <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342\u2032s</mark> lights are likely blending with those of the city, pilots said. Night vision goggles amplify light, making it harder to tell light sources apart. They also reduce field of vision. Pilots say they mitigate the effect by swiveling their heads.\n<u>AA 3130</u>, on the other hand, is flying over the dark river. Pilots told The Post this would have made the<b> </b>plane\u2019s lights far easier for the helicopter crew to see.\n25 seconds until impact\nAir traffic control receives an automated conflict alert that the helicopter and <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark> are on a path to intersect. The controller again contacts the helicopter, using its call sign: <i>\u201cPAT-25, do you have the CRJ in sight?\u201d</i>\n17 seconds until impact\nThe controller instructs the helicopter: <i>\u201cPAT-25, pass behind the CRJ.\u201d</i>\nAt this point, <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark> is curving northwest toward the airport. The jet\u2019s position and the angle of approach could cause the landing lights to appear less prominent and potentially go unnoticed by the helicopter crew, pilots said.\n15 seconds until impact\nFor the second time, the helicopter crew confirms they see the jet: \u201c<i>PAT-25 has the, uh, aircraft in sight, request visual separation.\u201d</i>\nThey are probably looking at <u>AA 3130</u>, the pilots<b> </b>said.\nEven if the helicopter crew spots <mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark>, they have little time to respond.\nThe jet is traveling at about 145 miles per hour and descending toward the level of the Black Hawk.\n2 seconds until impact\nThe<i><b> </b></i>helicopter transmits its last location.\n<mark class=\"hl_yellow\">AA 5342</mark> would be visible around 1,000 feet from the helicopter. According to the NTSB, the jet\u2019s crew have \u201ca verbal reaction,\u201d and the plane increases its pitch. The sound of impact is audible a second later. Gasps can be heard on air traffic audio.\nFlight data records a sudden drop in the jet\u2019s altitude.\nArmy officials and former colleagues described the Black Hawk crew, members of the 12th Aviation Battalion, as experienced aviators: Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Eaves and Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, both pilots, and Staff Sgt. Ryan O\u2019Hara, the crew chief. The flight was part of an annual flying evaluation for Lobach.\nArmy officials declined to comment on the findings outlined in this report.\nScott Dunham, a former air traffic controller and retired longtime NTSB investigator, said the instructions given to the helicopter crew that night were typical but additional information could have been provided in the second warning to reorient the helicopter. Former pilots who flew this route said that air traffic controllers sometimes instruct helicopter crews to pause at a designated point about a mile north of the airport when airspace is congested.\nOn Jan. 31, the Federal Aviation Administration indefinitely restricted helicopter traffic along parts of two routes near Reagan National Airport while it reviews the safety of the airspace.\nBefore the collision, many pilots would have likely described the helicopter <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/30/dc-helicopters-potomac-river-dangers/\">route</a> around <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2025/01/31/dc-plane-crash-passengers-fear-flying/\">Reagan</a> as higher risk but part of a routine flight, in use for decades, said Austin Roth, a former Black Hawk instructor pilot who also served in the 12th Aviation Battalion.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s looking back and thinking maybe this was inevitable,\u201d he said.\nAbout this story\nThe Post used 3D modeling software to reconstruct the scene in the sky over Washington in the minutes leading up to the fatal collision. The Post imported OpenStreetMap data of roads and building footprints into the scene as well as commercially available models of the Black Hawk helicopter, the Bombardier CRJ-700 and additional aircraft. We plotted and animated the flight paths of all aircraft using data from ADS-B Exchange, and timed these alongside key moments from Air Traffic Control radio communications. The Black Hawk\u2019s Model S signal was picked up through multilateration, which can be imprecise because it requires multiple receivers to have line of sight. Two former helicopter pilots said data that appeared to show the helicopter turn sharply, west of Hains Point, was most likely an anomaly as the speed at that time would make such a turn unlikely, so The Post excluded this data point from the reconstruction. Altitude data for the helicopter was available only in 100 feet increments. By mounting a camera inside a model of the helicopter, we were able to show the pilot\u2019s perspective throughout the flight and display where key aircraft would have likely appeared in their field of vision. The lighting within the 3D model is a representation rather than an accurate depiction of the thousands of lights across the city, which would be too complex to precisely render at this scale. Pilots consulted for this story include Ken Biddulph, Phillip Brashear and Bradley Bowman who all flew this route many times.\nCredits: Story editing by Nadine Ajaka and Eric Rich.

        "headline": "Trump moves to narrow independence of Fed, along with other Wall Street overseers",
        "content": "The Trump administration took another swing at the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence late Tuesday with a new executive order that seeks more control over federal agencies that have traditionally operated with day-to-day autonomy.\nEven as the White House executive order said it would protect the Fed\u2019s monetary policy \u2014 including its powers to set interest rates \u2014 it sought to scoop up all of Wall Street\u2019s biggest regulators and make their budgets subject to the authority of the White House budget office.\nIt\u2019s just the latest political attack on the Fed, a 111-year institution responsible for setting short-term borrowing costs that trickle through the financial sector and influence what millions of consumers and businesses pay to borrow money. It also plays a key role supervising and regulating Wall Street.\nIt\u2019s possible little of Tuesday\u2019s order will ultimately apply to the Fed because Congress established the central bank to operate with significant independence in determining how to use its resources. The order notes it does not seek to \u201cimpair\u201d any authorities Congress has given to independent agencies.\n\u201cTime, the courts and Congress will ultimately determine whether and how much of this sticks,\u201d said Scott Alvarez, a former general counsel at the Fed. \u201cWhat\u2019s important at this point is the President has announced he wants to dismantle a system of independent agencies that Congress has established and the courts have upheld and wants to shift funding decisions from Congress and the appropriations process to himself.\u201d\nLaws and norms have traditionally protected the Fed from the executive branch, with the aim of demonstrating to global markets that U.S. monetary policy isn\u2019t at the mercy of the political whims of the White House. But President Donald Trump has made clear he thinks he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/23/trump-federal-reserve/\" target=_blank>should get more of a say</a>.\nThe Fed declined to comment. A White House spokesman had no immediate comment.\nFor their part, Fed officials of their own volition have already made a series of decisions in the first weeks of the Trump administration to align internal policies with lawful directives from the White House, with the aim of avoiding a dispute with the administration, Fed watchers say.\nAlmost immediately after Trump was sworn into office, Fed officials announced a suspension of \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d programs, as well as a systemwide hiring freeze, according to emails reviewed by The Washington Post. The Fed is also trying to align to Trump\u2019s return-to-office policies, with officials considering reductions to remote work.\n\u201cAs has been our practice over many administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,\u201d Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell told reporters earlier this month.\nThe difference in the move on Tuesday is that the White House appears to be trying to force the changes on the Fed when it comes to its oversight and regulation of Wall Street. The order requires that independent agencies submit major regulations to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review.\nThe new order also states that only the president and the attorney general \u2014 \u201csubject to the President\u2019s supervision and control\u201d \u2014 will interpret law on behalf of the executive branch, blocking independent federal agencies from adopting legal interpretations that are at odds with the Trump White House.\nOMB is run by Russell Vought, a fiscal hawk who helped to craft Project 2025, a controversial policy blueprint that has informed Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Specifically, Project 2025 suggests the Fed\u2019s role should be narrowed to only keeping the money supply stable, <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-24.pdf\" target=_blank>not regulating Wall Street banks or acting as a lender of last resort when big banks fail</a>, because \u201cpolitical pressure has led the Federal Reserve to use its power to regulate banks as a way to promote politically favorable initiatives,\u201d the paper said.\nFed watchers say the central bank\u2019s actions to date suggest it wants to choose its battles carefully, avoiding conflicts with Trump that don\u2019t directly threaten its control over monetary policy. The Fed has fiercely protected its independence since the high-inflation era of the 1970s. That period was partly driven by the central bank\u2019s own missteps under pressure from President Richard M. Nixon to keep rates low, despite signs that the economy was overheating, to help his reelection campaign.\n\u201cThe Fed is willing to go all 15 rounds with the sitting president to preserve its ability to make interest-rate policy separate from the Oval Office,\u201d said Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt is not willing to separate itself from the Oval Office on nearly anything else.\u201d\n\u201cThe White House \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 appears to insist on precisely this balance of power,\u201d he added. \u201cThe question only remains whether President Trump and those closest to him will continue to regard even monetary policy as outside of his immediate control.\u201d\nFor months, Trump officials have privately discussed ways to streamline the alphabet soup of agencies responsible for overseeing Wall Street. One approach envisions consolidating agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency into a single entity, according to people familiar with the discussions granted anonymity to convey internal plans.\nLacking sufficient votes in the Senate to overhaul the financial regulatory system, the White House\u2019s order could provide a backup approach to trying to consolidate at least some control of financial regulation, even if it remains unlikely the Fed\u2019s regulatory functions wind up under the direct purview of the president. The Fed, the FDIC and the comptroller are the three primary federal banking regulators.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Fed has moved quickly to align its policies with those of a new administration. At the start of Trump\u2019s first term, the central bank similarly adopted a hiring freeze ordered across the government by the president.\nThis time, the political environment is more hostile to the Fed. During Trump\u2019s first term, some Republican senators backed Powell against repeated efforts by Trump to undermine the independence of the Fed. Most of those lawmakers are no longer in office.\nThe push for more say over the Fed comes after Michael Barr, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for banking supervision, last month said he would step down from the role at the end of this month, avoiding a potential legal fight over whether Trump had the authority to demote him.\nThe Fed\u2019s move to comply with earlier orders from the White House has been evident in the way it immediately removed public-facing webpages highlighting the board\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts following a directive from Trump that agencies cease such work.\nThe shift is notable at some regional Fed banks. At the New York Fed, officials canceled a reception scheduled for Thursday and also withdrew from a summer fellowship program that aimed to support women and underrepresented groups in economics, according to a social media post from Yana van der Meulen Rodgers, an economist at Rutgers University. A bank official attributed the cancellations to the suspension of DEI work, according to an email reviewed by The Post.\nThe New York Fed declined to comment.\nAt the Kansas City Fed, top officials told staff members on Halloween \u2014 less than a week before the presidential election \u2014 that the bank\u2019s commitment to DEI \u201cremains steadfast,\u201d according to a message to the bank\u2019s roughly 2,000 employees reviewed by The Post.\nThat contrasted sharply with a Jan. 28 message from the top two officials at each Fed bank announcing the system was \u201ctemporarily pausing\u201d diversity initiatives through at least February.\n<i>Jeff Stein contributed to this report.</i>"

        "headline": "Trump, Modi aim to cut U.S. trade gap with India amid global tariff concerns",
        "content": "The United States and India are working toward a deal that aims to cut America\u2019s sizable trade gap with India as New Delhi pledges to buy more U.S. energy, weapons and civil nuclear power, President Donald Trump said Thursday during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Washington.\nThe meeting with Modi \u2014 the fourth foreign leader to visit Trump in the White House since his inauguration \u2014 was one of the earliest measures of how Trump will handle his relationship with New Delhi. The partnership is a pillar of Washington\u2019s strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, but one that is beset with trouble spots on illegal immigration, visas, America\u2019s large trade deficit with India and controversies over India\u2019s attempted assassination of a Sikh activist on American soil.\nDuring the news conference, Trump sought to emphasize the friendship between Washington and New Delhi, even as he announced shortly before it that the United States would implement a \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff policy that would tax foreign goods at the same rate that other nations apply to American products, potentially complicating talks with India.\nTrump said the United States will increase military sales to India by \u201cmany billions of dollars\u201d and would consider providing New Delhi F-35 fighter jets. He reiterated his dismay with India\u2019s tariffs toward the United States, but said the two countries will negotiate a trade deal that will ensure a \u201clevel playing field.\u201d Trump said India will reform its laws to welcome U.S. nuclear technology into its domestic market.\nOn the issue of immigration \u2014 which sparked outrage in India after the Trump administration sent deportees back to the country in shackles on military fights \u2014 Modi said New Delhi will comply with Trump\u2019s desires. \u201cWe are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they have absolutely no right to be in that country,\u201d Modi said.\nIn one of the few moments the Indian prime minister spoke English, Modi became the latest leader trying to foster a personal relationship with Trump. The Indian leader borrowed from Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rhetoric to announce his own vision: Make India Great Again, or MIGA, he said in English, adding that the two countries could continue to help each other.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes \u2018mega\u2019 \u2014 a mega-partnership for prosperity,\u201d the Indian prime minister said, according to a translator.\nThe United States is India\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-india/\">largest</a> trading partner, buying more than 18 percent of all its exports. India exported $45 billion more to the United States than it imported, and Trump is keen to shrink that deficit. The lack of parity, as well as lingering frustration from a trade deal that never materialized during his first term, drove Trump to describe India on the campaign trail last year as a \u201cvery big abuser\u201d of tariffs.\nIn a call with Modi <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/readout-of-president-donald-j-trumps-call-with-prime-minister-modi-of-india/\">last month</a> \u2014 the second such conversation between the two leaders since the American election \u2014 Trump stressed the \u201cimportance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship,\u201d according to a White House readout.\nModi visited Washington <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/indias-modi-meet-trump-with-planned-tariff-concessions-2025-02-10/\">armed</a> with concessions aimed at averting a trade war and staving off damaging tariffs on the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. The concessions include a commitment to significantly boost purchases of American energy. New Delhi has already reduced tariffs on high-end American motorcycles \u2014 a fixation for Trump, who repeatedly called the 100 percent duty on Harley-Davidsons \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nIndia signaled it was open to offering tariff concessions for imports from the United States in several sectors, including electronics, medical equipment and chemicals, an analyst familiar with the matter said. The Modi administration is looking at potential deals on U.S. agriculture exports and nuclear energy investments, the analyst added, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Reuters earlier reported the possible concessions.\nAhead of his meeting with Trump, Modi on Thursday met with the president\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz. He also held meetings with billionaire Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, according to Indian officials. On Wednesday, he held talks with Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard.\nDuring the news conference Thursday evening, the two leaders said a key path to shrinking America\u2019s trade gap with India involves selling billions of dollars worth of energy, especially liquid natural gas, to India. The Biden administration had paused liquid natural gas project approvals as part of its effort to curb climate change. While the leaders were speaking, Waltz posted on X: \u201cDrill Baby Drill = Buy Baby Buy.\u201d\nModi said that India and the United States will collaborate on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum technology. Trump said the United States would also extradite one of the plotters of the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai.\nAlso, Modi announced that India was moving to change its liability laws to enable U.S. civil nuclear energy firms to sell reactors there. The law currently puts liability on the supplier, not the operator.\nSuch a move would be \u201ca long-sought win for the Trump administration,\u201d said Lindsey Ford, White House director for South Asia in the Biden administration. \u201cBut Modi\u2019s decision to announce a similar agreement with France one day prior is a reminder for the United States that U.S. technology will not be the only game in town.\u201d\nA sign of the growing confidence between the two governments was Trump\u2019s statement that his administration was open to considering selling the vaunted F-35 stealth fighter jet to India, a weapons platform the United States makes available to only its closest and most trusted allies and partners.\nBut the weapon is costly and India would need to \u201cdramatically overhaul and upgrade its industrial security procedures to better protect against espionage and technology leakage,\u201d said Sameer Lalwani, a senior expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gesture of trust\u201d that Trump was even willing to contemplate that, he said. But the Indians are intent on building their own fighter jets, he said.\nThere would also be significant national security concerns with selling the fifth-generation fighter to India, which has recently fielded Russian S-400 air defense systems. Operating the two near one another enhances the risk that the Russian air defenses could acquire data that compromises the fighter\u2019s stealth signature, and could be used by Russia or China to better detect and target American F-35s, he said.\nThe trip also came in the wake of tensions around immigration. Last week, scenes of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/modi-trump-white-house-india-immigration-tariffs/\">dramatic deportation of more than 100 Indians</a>, who were sent back in shackles on a military jet, caused enormous embarrassment to Modi domestically. India is a major source of illegal immigration to the United States. As of 2022, it accounted for 725,000 out of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, according to the Pew Research Center.\nOver the Christmas holiday, far-right activists in Trump\u2019s base engaged in a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/27/h-1b-visas-elon-musk-trump-immigration/\">civil war</a>\u201d with Musk and other senior Trump allies over the need for a skilled-worker visa program that Silicon Valley has long relied on. Many Indians decried the backlash as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/07/india-maga-h1b-visa-america/\">racist</a>.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nModi said he did not discuss with Trump whether the American president would take action on the U.S. court case against Gautam Adani, an Indian billionaire and ally of the Indian prime minister accused of bribery schemes.\nTrump and Modi have forged a positive relationship since their first meeting in 2017, punctuated by reciprocal mass rallies \u2014 \u201cHowdy Modi\u201d in Houston in 2019 and \u201cNamaste Trump\u201d in Ahmedabad, India, in 2020. Their bond stems from a shared strategic interest in countering China as well as the cultivation of a strongman image.\nWashington has over the past 20 years grown closer to New Delhi, slowly diminishing India\u2019s decades-long dependence on Russian arms, for instance, though it has been buying large quantities of Russian oil.\nHeightened tensions with China after deadly border clashes in 2020 helped drive India closer to the United States, which has provided intelligence and equipment, including leased Predator drones, to help India defend its frontier.\nTrump in his first term revived a grouping known as \u201cthe Quad,\u201d consisting of India, Japan, the United States and Australia, widely seen as a counterweight to China\u2019s growing influence in the region. The Biden administration advanced the initiative, and analysts say that Trump may push the group in a more security-oriented direction.\nThe two countries established <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/01/31/india-us-tech-defense/\">a significant partnership</a> in emerging technology during the Biden administration, announcing for instance co-production plans for military jet engines and armored infantry vehicles.\nOne area that is likely to have a lower profile now is human rights, analysts said. The attempted assassination of the Sikh activist in 2023 caused tension between the two governments and led to murder-for-hire charges against an Indian intelligence official, who has since left the government.\nAdministration officials declined to comment on the matter on Thursday.\n\u201cI think now that issue is somewhat behind us,\u201d said Lisa Curtis, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a White House South Asia aide in Trump\u2019s first term.\nTrump also sought to flatter his Indian counterpart, grinning as he responded to a question about who won their negotiations.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a much tougher negotiator than me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a much better negotiator than me.\u201d\n<i>Anant Gupta and Karishma Mehrotra in New Delhi contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "The Justice Department is recruiting new attorneys to help defend President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration and other policies in court, according to public job postings, department officials and legal experts.\nThe aim is to create a cadre of lawyers with the skills and willingness to back the administration as it gears up for legal challenges on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/24/birthright-citizenship-democrats-lawsuits/\" target=_blank>birthright citizenship</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/25/guantanamo-trump-migrants-deportations-venezuela/\" target=_blank>sending migrants</a> to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/26/doge-federal-workforce-firings-job-cuts/\" target=_blank>federal workforce firings</a>, deep spending cuts and more.\nThe hirings are largely to fill openings created by the high number of civil division attorneys who have resigned since the 2024 presidential election, according to people familiar with the situation, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals and to discuss sensitive information.\nBut the effort also gives the Justice Department an opportunity to bring a slew of attorneys who align ideologically with the president into career positions in high-profile sections of the department.\nMultiple job postings say the Justice Department is seeking \u201cmany\u201d attorneys to work in its Federal Programs Branch and the Office of Immigration Litigation. Both departments are in the civil division, and their attorneys would be at the forefront of deportation fights and defending the most controversial executive branch policies, including a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/25/trump-refugee-ban-blocked/\" target=_blank>refugee ban</a>, terminations of government workers and the slashing of government agencies.\nThe attorneys would work under senior political appointees being hired to the Justice Department, many of whom are attorneys from conservative law firms and Republican state governments.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement agenda is a top national security priority that this Department of Justice is prepared to vigorously defend whenever challenged in court,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said in a statement.\nThe Justice Department is also planning to temporarily assign people to the civil divisions from other offices to defend Trump administration policies, according to a public listing on LinkedIn. At least some of those detailees could come from the civil rights division \u2014 an area of the Justice Department that is expected to have dwindling workload demands during the Trump administration.\nAnd attorneys in departments that do not typically deal with immigration enforcement are being asked to handle some immigration matters, the people familiar with the situation said.\nThe job listings, coupled with interviews with current and former Justice Department officials, suggest that the Trump administration is preparing for extensive and prolonged legal battles in court, with the department seeking both trial attorneys and those who specialize in the appeals process.\nAlready, the Trump administration is facing more than 80 lawsuits over its efforts to dramatically reshape the federal government and national policies. Several initiatives have been temporarily blocked by lower-court judges, and so far two have reached the Supreme Court.\nWhile many federal agencies are slashing probationary employees and laying off workers en masse, the Justice Department workforce has largely remained intact since Trump took office.\nHis administration has pushed out or transferred top career officials who held powerful jobs in agency, creating uncertainty and mistrust among the career workforce by according to people familiar. But it has not fired or laid off large swaths of rank and file attorneys or staff.\nStill, there has been high staff turnover in key divisions, creating an opportunity for the Trump administration to hire more career attorneys who strongly support its legal positions and approach.\nIn some government agencies, the federal hiring freeze mandated by the Trump White House has meant that they cannot replace people who quit. At Justice \u2014 with many jobs focused on Trump\u2019s priorities of boosting deportations and combating violent crime \u2014 the hirings have continued.\nAround a third of the 130 attorneys in the Federal Programs Branch have quit the Justice Department since Election Day, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. More resignations are expected as the workload and demands pile up, these people said.\nWhile federal law would prohibit Justice Department officials from asking about the political ideologies during the hiring process of career employees, legal experts said that the federal programs branch is always entwined with White House policies. In the Biden administration, for example, attorneys in this division defended the president\u2019s student loan forgiveness plans, covid mandates, challenges to firearm regulations and more.\nPeople who are strongly against Trump administration policies would be unlikely to apply for a job that would put them at the forefront of defending those policies, people familiar with how the branch works said.\nIn general, the office is filled with career staffers, a group of whom may disagree with any given administration, the people said. Career staffers and political appointees are supposed to work together to find strong strategies for defending presidential policies that meet legal muster \u2014 a process that often entails disagreements and workshopping legal arguments.\nBut some attorneys are frustrated because they are being asked simply to defend Trump\u2019s policies, with little room for discussion or dissent, according to a former civil division employee who is familiar with the branch\u2019s current dynamics.\nThe Office of Immigration Litigation is a division of more than 300 attorneys who typically handle the process of stripping citizenship from immigrants who commit crimes or have used fraud on their naturalization applications. These attorneys also defend the government when there is an appeal of a decision made in the administrative immigration courts.\n\nAn attorney from the Office of Immigration Litigation was also listed on the Trump administration\u2019s civil lawsuits against the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, which seek to block state and local protections for undocumented immigrants. Involvement in cases like this is unusual for the Office of Immigration Litigation, people familiar with the office said.\nThe Trump administration has also created a division focused on fighting what are known as \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d which are typically Democratic cities with a policy of protecting immigrants who are in the country illegally and not cooperating with federal authorities to deport them.\nJustice Department officials have transferred veteran career officials from other divisions \u2014 many of whom have little background in immigration law \u2014 to this office, giving them the option of quitting if they do not want to work there.\nThe office is reporting to the deputy attorney general. Officials say it is up and running, though it is unclear what litigation the office is working on."

All told, total enrollment was up 4.5 percent in the fall compared with the previous year.\nThursday\u2019s report arrives a week after the Clearinghouse said a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/01/14/college-freshman-enrollment-increase-data-error/\">\u201cmethodological error\u201d</a> skewed its preliminary calculation of the number of first-year students who enrolled in fall 2024. The center initially said freshman enrollment dropped 5 percent, but later discovered that some college freshmen were incorrectly labeled as dual-enrolled in high school and college classes.\nThe Clearinghouse has been a trusted source for enrollment trends in higher education because it collects information from 97 percent of the 3,600 degree-granting institutions in the country. The center produces enrollment data sooner than the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/timing-of-ipeds-data-collection#:~:text=Provisional%20data%20are%20first%20released,year%20for%20some%20survey%20components).\">Education Department</a>, which typically has a nearly year-long time lag.\nSome observers questioned why it took the center months to identify its error, especially when previous reports indicated a nascent rebound in higher-education enrollment.\n\u201cOur sensitivity to abnormally large changes was somewhat reduced because we had a host of ready explanations for why we might be seeing these declines,\u201d Doug Shapiro, the research center\u2019s executive director, said on a call with reporters Wednesday. \u201cIt would have surprised us in a normal year, but in the year in which we had issues with the FAFSA, changes in the economy \u2026 and all other kinds of things that could be driving a change like that, kind of dulled our sensors.\u201d\nThe preliminary report the Clearinghouse released in October relied on reporting from half of colleges and universities that submit data to the center. Thursday\u2019s report, however, is based on the vast majority of colleges and uses a different methodology to determine freshman enrollment.\nAccording to the final fall numbers, freshman head counts grew 5.5 percent, driven by the enrollment of students over age 21. The number of 18-year-olds heading to college also climbed by 3.4 percent but is still below pre-pandemic levels. Traditional-age freshmen grew at the highest rates among students from low-income neighborhoods, particularly at community colleges.\n\u201cWe saw larger declines initially among low-income students during the pandemic, so some of this may be a return to normal,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cBut it is hard to speculate what\u2019s driving that difference.\u201d\nCommunity colleges, which bore the brunt of enrollment losses during the pandemic, are now reporting some of the strongest enrollment gains, although they remain below pre-pandemic levels. Those with a focus on vocational education witnessed double-digit growth for the second year in a row. Students are also flocking to certificate programs, where enrollments are now 28.5 percent above 2019 levels, according to the Clearinghouse.\nEnrollment in bachelor\u2019s and associate\u2019s degree programs is also up, by 2.9 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively, but these remain below 2019 levels. Student head counts are up across all regions, with the Northeast recording the first gain in enrollment since before the pandemic."

Anwar Rajab, spokesman for the Palestinian security forces, told The Washington Post that the United States was considered a \u201cbig donor to the PA projects\u201d that included security training for the forces.\nA former Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue said that the Palestinian Authority security forces were \u201cnot affected in any meaningful way\u201d by the freeze and that \u201cother donors have committed to make up the shortfall.\u201d\nBut the freeze has already led to cuts in some training, a colonel at the authority\u2019s Central Training Institute for security forces told The Post on Tuesday. He spoke on the condition of anonymity per his office\u2019s protocol.\nA meeting planned with American officials this month to assess the authority\u2019s operation targeting militants in the Jenin refugee camp \u2014 which stopped after Israeli forces invaded last month \u2014 was postponed and has not been rescheduled, he said. Washington was also funding the building of a virtual shooting range, which the institute needs because Israel will not permit the importation of bullets for live-fire training sessions, the colonel said. Though the project was almost completed, the institute is seeking alternative funders because of the U.S. freeze, he said.\nConfirmation of the aid freeze comes amid widespread confusion about programs the Trump administration is saving or suspending.\nU.S. officials have been loath to specify <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/29/pepfar-trump-hiv-aids-aid-pause/\" target=_blank>what programs</a> are spared under exemptions issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio for \u201clifesaving\u201d assistance, aid to Israel, HIV prevention programs and other priorities. And even in cases when exemptions apply, aid organizations have in many cases been unable to continue to work because Rubio\u2019s directives have effectively shut down the payment systems required to draw down funds.\nThe United States has for years supported the Palestinian Authority security forces, viewing them as critical to Israel\u2019s security. The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has provided approximately $1.1 billion in civilian security and justice assistance to support the authority\u2019s security forces since 2007, the State Department said last year.\nThe Biden administration also backed proposals for the Palestinian Authority to play a key role in postwar Gaza, which both Israel and Hamas, the authority\u2019s internal rival, oppose.\nThe authority is struggling to control a new generation of Palestinian militancy in the West Bank that\u2019s centered in the territory\u2019s northern refugee camps and draws support from widespread frustration with the aging authority leadership, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, who is 89.\n\nThe State Department said the funding is under review but did not provide clarity on when a determination is likely to be made. \u201cThe Department and USAID paused nearly all foreign assistance,\u201d the department said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Agency for International Development. \u201cThe Department of State has granted waivers for critical programming that aligns with Administration priorities in the region.\u201d\n<i>Hudson reported from Washington.

        "content": "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) on Monday took a hardened stance toward what he described as a \u201cfull crisis situation\u201d manufactured by the still-new Trump administration, a shift in tone after months of careful political maneuvering to preserve any cooperation that the deep-blue state could get from the federal government.\nMoore had greeted President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in November by saying he wanted to work to find <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/08/maryland-governor-wes-moore-trump/\" target=_blank>\u201ccommon ground\u201d</a> with the incoming president, as long as he could also protect the interests of Maryland residents.\nOver the past five weeks, he said, that goal has increasingly seemed unattainable, and on Monday he accused Trump of \u201ckicking children off of Medicaid so we can make space in the budget for tax cuts for billionaires.\u201d\nIn a response to Moore\u2019s criticisms, the White House struck back at Democrats who have slammed the recent cuts to federal jobs and spending under the guidance of the Elon Musk-led U.S. DOGE Service, also known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\u201cThe Democrats have no plan on how to recover from their embarrassing loss, and it shows,\u201d White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in an email. \u201cInstead of working to become a party that focuses on the will of the people, they are hell-bent on keeping their heads in the sand and gaslighting on the widely supported mission of DOGE.\u201d\nTrump last week appointed Moore to the bipartisan Council of Governors, which works to strengthen state and federal partnerships on national security, disaster response and military coordination.\nMoore attended a meeting of governors from across the country in D.C. on Friday. Moore said Republican and Democratic governors had productive and interesting conversations about policy. When Trump showed up, Moore said, it became clear that he did not intend to listen to the state leaders.\n\u201cWhen the president of the United States walked into the room, that\u2019s when things went off the rails,\u201d he said.\nTrump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/22/janet-mills-maine-trump-transgender-athletes/\" target=_blank>clashed with the Democratic governor of Maine</a> over an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/05/transgender-students-trump-executive-order/\" target=_blank>executive order</a> that bans transgender athletes from competing on girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports teams, and he threatened to withhold all federal funding from the state if it does not comply. Moore described the president\u2019s remarks as \u201can hour-long diatribe of conspiracy theories and attacks on my colleagues.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve come back from these meetings with all of our nation\u2019s governors \u2026 with a full-blown understanding that this is a full crisis situation,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for all of us to take this moment seriously.\u201d\nAlready facing a $3 billion budget deficit, Maryland stands to lose a lot amid the administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal government and reduce spending.\nThe state is home to many federal workers who have either lost their jobs in recent weeks or are in danger of losing them amid the Trump administration\u2019s spending cuts. Government contractors and nonprofits who depend on federal grants are also laying off workers and closing shop.\nOther changes being contemplated by the administration and a Republican-controlled Congress would further devastate Maryland\u2019s economy, Moore said. Those actions could soon include <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/18/medicaid-cuts-work-requirements-congress-republicans/8f3a7244-edf0-11ef-bd80-8f2ac5c75a8a_story.html\" target=_blank>cuts to Medicaid</a>, reductions in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and a full shutdown of the federal government that would leave tens of thousands of Marylanders temporarily out of work, he said. The governor said he left D.C. on Friday with the feeling that the Trump administration relishes the potential fallout from those decisions.\n\u201cNot only is this going to continue; they are going to accelerate,\u201d Moore said.\nFor months, Moore and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/governors-trump-whitmer-mills-transgender-musk-tariffs/faebeb86-f22c-11ef-acb5-08900d482a27_story.html\" target=_blank>other Democratic leaders</a> have been trying to navigate the tension between protecting whatever federal resources they can get for their states and voicing their concerns about the president\u2019s words and actions.\nMoore<b> </b>was photographed in December smiling and shaking hands with Trump at the Army-Navy football game, a gesture to show good faith.\nBy the time Moore gave his State of the State address early this month, his rhetoric had begun to shift. He didn\u2019t name Trump, but he lamented the \u201cuncertainty, confusion and chaos\u201d of the first few weeks of the new administration.\nLess than a month after that speech, Moore on Monday shared doubts that a partnership can exist between the deeply blue state and the Trump White House.\nMoore said governors in both parties were willing to work together on some issues, especially to build a strong economy, but Trump did not engage in the bipartisan conversation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody, either Democrat or Republican, could walk away from what happened this weekend and say that same measure of cohesion existed between our nation\u2019s governors and the White House,\u201d he said."

        "content": "JUBATA AL-KHASHAB, Syria \u2014 As the Israeli military swept into a string of Syrian villages nearly two months ago, the soldiers assured locals that the presence would be temporary \u2014 the aim limited to seizing weapons and securing the area after the collapse of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.\nBut the earthmoving vehicles that followed suggest a more permanent presence.\n\u201cThey are building military bases. How is that temporary?\u201d asked Mohammed Muraiwid, the mayor of Jubata al-Khashab, who has watched Israel troops construct a new military outpost on the edge of his village.\n\nSatellite imagery examined by The Washington Post shows more than half a dozen structures and vehicles in the walled Israeli base, with nearly identical construction five miles to the south. Both are linked by new dirt roads to territory in the Golan Heights that Israel captured in its 1967 war with its Arab neighbors. An area of cleared land, which experts say appears to be the beginnings of a third base, is visible another few miles south.\nHours after Assad\u2019s grip on his country crumbled in December, Israeli tanks and troops broke through the \u201cAlpha line\u201d that has marked the ceasefire boundary over the past half-century and moved into a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone inside Syrian territory, and in some cases beyond.\n\n\nIsraeli troops now come and go in the 90-square-mile buffer zone, which is supposed to be demilitarized, according to the 1974 ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria. Israel has said it considers that deal void following the Assad regime\u2019s collapse. At its widest, the buffer zone is about six miles across, but at certain points Israeli troops have advanced several miles beyond it, local officials said.\n<div style=\"max-width:700px; margin: 0 auto;\"><iframe title=\"New installations in Syria\" aria-label=\"Locator map\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-UGa6S\" class=\"pg-graphic fallback-available\" data-fallback-image-url=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UGa6S/fallback.png\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UGa6S/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none; margin-bottom:2em;\" height=\"513\"></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n</script>\nIn an interview with The Post on Sunday, Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra described the Israeli advance as a \u201cviolation against the Syrian people.\u201d\n\u201cThis incursion is unjustified,\u201d he said, adding that the Iranian threat at the heart of Israeli concerns over Syria no longer exists. \u201cThey had a problem with Iran; we saved them from Iran.\u201d\nThe Israeli military has the capability to protect its borders from its previous positions, he said, calling on it to withdraw.\nThe two new construction sites, located within what had until recently been Syrian-controlled territory, appear to be forward observation bases, similar in structure and style to those in the Israeli-held part of the Golan Heights, said William Goodhind, an imagery analyst at Contested Ground. The base in Jubata al-Khashab is more fully developed, while the one to the south appears to be under construction. The former would provide better visibility for troops, while the latter has better access to the area\u2019s road network, as would a third base if built on the area of cleared land farther south, he said. The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmn3jmm1yo\" target=_blank>BBC originally reported</a> construction at the site in Jubata al-Khashab.\n\nSatellite imagery also shows a new road, located about 10 miles south of the city of Quneitra, stretching from the boundary line to the top of a hill near the village of Kodana, providing Israeli forces with a new surveillance point.\n\nTo build the outpost near Jubata al-Khashab, Muraiwid said Israeli bulldozers have ripped down village fruit trees and other trees in part of a protected nature reserve. \u201cWe told them we consider this an occupation,\u201d the mayor said.\nSince entering Syria, Israeli soldiers have also set up checkpoints, closed roads, raided houses, displaced residents and fired on protesters who have demonstrated against their presence, locals say. At night, patrols have been spotted on back roads with lights turned off, before returning to base.\n\u201cNo one knows what they were doing. No one dares to ask,\u201d said Budour Hassan, 55, as she picked leaves for tea a few dozen yards from an Israeli roadblock.\n\nIn response to questions about the nature and duration of its activities in Syria, the Israel Defense Forces said, \u201cIDF forces are operating in southern Syria, within the buffer zone and at strategic points, to protect the residents of northern Israel.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said the troop presence is indefinite, citing security concerns.\nRegarding reports that Israeli troops had fired on protesters, the IDF said it had operated \u201cin accordance with standard operating procedures\u201d after demonstrators had been asked to distance themselves from soldiers.\nThe push into territory previously controlled by Syria comes at a time when Israel is operating beyond its borders on multiple fronts to keep its enemies at a distance, following Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel, which killed about 1,200 Israelis. In Gaza, Israeli forces have destroyed thousands of buildings within about half a mile of the border fence to establish a \u201cspecial security zone.\u201d During the war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Israeli military has systematically leveled villages near the border between the two countries.\n\nThe  militants who now control the vast majority of Syria are noticeably absent from areas near the boundary. Syria\u2019s new leader, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/29/israel-gaza-war-ceasefire-hostages-hamas-steve-witkoff/\" target=_blank>Ahmed al-Sharaa</a>, has said he is committed to upholding the 1974 agreement that created the demilitarized buffer zone between the Israelis and Syrians.\n\u201cMaybe they have a deal with Israel we do not know,\u201d said Hayel al-Abdulla, 77, the tribal leader in the tiny village of Samdaniya al-Gharbiya.\nWhen Israeli troops blocked a road just south of Abdulla\u2019s home with earth and rocks, he said he objected. \u201cI told them this is not Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just block us in.\u201d\nThe defense minister said a unit of Syrian forces has been prepped to return to old regime positions in the area, some of which are now occupied by Israeli troops. Negotiations are ongoing through both the United Nations and United States to enable them to do so, Abu Qasra said.\n\n\nIsrael has said part of its mission is seizing weapons to prevent attacks on its communities. But Muraiwid said there are none left. When Israeli troops arrived in Muraiwid\u2019s village, they demanded that residents turn over weapons that had been abandoned by fleeing regime troops, he said. Locals agreed to collect the weapons and hand them over to avoid the kind of raids Israeli troops were conducting elsewhere.\nThey returned twice more. \u201cThe third time they came, I told them even if we had weapons, Syria has a new government, and we will give them to our new government,\u201d Muraiwid said, sitting in a carpeted meeting room with expansive views of the surrounding countryside.\nThe Israeli military said Saturday that its troops in Syria had come under fire and \u201cresponded by firing shots.\u201d A group calling itself the Islamic Resistance Front in Syria claimed responsibility. Local rebels played down the incident, saying it had occurred when a local criminal family thought Syrian forces were trying to detain its members.\nOver international objections, Israel in 1981 annexed the areas of the Golan Heights it captured from Syria. Israel said the move was necessary to prevent Syrian shelling of farms in Israel\u2019s Galilee region. But the plateau is also vital for Israel\u2019s water supplies, feeding the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River.\n\n\nThe buffer zone includes a dam at a reservoir that supplies water to swaths of southern Syria. There are suspicions among local residents Israel that is making a grab for water and other resources. Despite its operations in the area, the Israeli miliary says it does not control the dam.\nFor Syrian residents living near the ceasefire line, such as the tribal leader Abdulla, their presence on a geopolitical fault line has meant decades of tumult, caught between Israel and Assad\u2019s regime. Some buildings here remain scarred by battles involving the government, Syrian rebel groups and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, with bullet marks and gaping holes from artillery fire still visible.\n\nIsrael has long been determined to curb the presence along the ceasefire line of Iranian-backed militant groups that supported the Assad regime.\nIn August, Israeli forces began to carve a new 5.5-mile-long trench about 100 feet inside the Syrian side of the boundary fence, according to satellite imagery. The trench cuts through the land of Ahmed Bakr, 35, who lives in a roughly constructed two-bedroom home with his two wives and 10 children. Drones buzzing overhead observe his interactions with visitors.\n\n\nHe is no stranger to interactions with Israelis. Bakr\u2019s 9-year-old daughter was actually born in Israel, under an Israeli initiative to build support and influence on the Syrian side of the buffer zone. During the Syrian civil war, Israel also ferried wounded rebel fighters past the dividing fence to be treated in Israeli hospitals and, according to local officials, funded a local faction to fight the Assad government and its Hezbollah allies.\nNow, the Israelis carry out foot patrols and raid houses, and a new Israeli base has cut villagers off from grazing lands, forcing the locals to buy more grain for their livestock, they say. \u201cEveryone is worried, not only me,\u201d Bakr said.\nAmong those concerns is the fear they may be displaced. The regional capital of Madinat al-Baath, a mile from the ceasefire line, was built in 1986 by the Syrian government for families displaced from the Golan Heights in previous conflicts with Israel. Most of the 100,000 Syrians estimated to have lived on the territory captured by Israel were never allowed to return. Now, an Israeli tank sits outside the governorate building formerly occupied by Assad\u2019s Baath Party. Locals dart past a street that has been cut off by a makeshift Israeli roadblock of rubble and a downed streetlamp.\n\u201cWe will not let the same thing happen again,\u201d said Bilal Suleiman, head of the local municipality. \u201cThere is not a one-in-a-million possibility we will leave.\u201d\n\nMost of those ordered from their homes during the initial advance of Israeli troops across the line in December have been allowed to return. But some families said they have been blocked from doing so.\n\u201cMost people were allowed back, but they told me my house is a military zone,\u201d said Jadallah Hamoud, 52, who stopped to eye the blocked road leading to his home as he returned from buying bread. He said he is staying with friends in a nearby town with his wife and eight children and managed to get another farmer to take in his two cows and 15 sheep. But he had to turn his dogs and chickens loose, with no place to keep them.\n\n\nThe IDF denied that families are still displaced.\nIn an effort to shed its associations with Assad\u2019s Baath Party, the town renamed itself Madinat al-Salaam, or City of Peace, in December. \u201cMaybe they didn\u2019t understand the message,\u201d said Qasem al-Mohammad, 57, gesturing toward the tank.\n<i>Kelly reported from Washington.</i>"

Studying primate characteristics requires accessing their skeletons \u2014 some of which may be hard to study because of distance, financial resources or concerns about the specimens themselves.\n\u201cOne of our concerns for the primate collection, which is very heavily used, has always been wear and tear of the specimens,\u201d Nancy Simmons, curator in charge of the American Museum of Natural History\u2019s mammalogy department, said in a news <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/primate-digital-collections\" target=_blank>release</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen different sets of researchers measuring and scanning the same items again and again. Being able to share these 3D scans with researchers around the world is huge and reduces possible damage to the collection items.\u201d\nSimmons and her co-authors described the collection in a December <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-04261-5\" target=_blank>paper</a> in Scientific Data. They say it is the largest 3D morphological dataset of its kind in primates.\n\u201cOpen data sharing is essential to equal advancement in all fields of science,\u201d they write, noting that 3D scanning of important specimens is often an on-demand process provided to individuals. Making the collection freely available, they write, will enable more comprehensive research and could advance the study of human origins, which is closely linked to that of primate evolution.\nWant to take a look at the data?

But Jordan counts on significant annual aid from the United States and Abdullah politely sat alongside Trump as the latter reminded the world of the possibility of that assistance being shut off. After their meeting, the Jordanian king issued a statement rejecting Palestinian \u201cdisplacement.\u201d Arab officials are putting together a different proposal for the administration and reconstruction of Gaza that will allow its population to remain.\nThe next day, Trump startled allies in Europe with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/12/trump-putin-talks-ukraine-war/\" target=_blank>a call to Putin</a>. The overture broke years of silence between the White House and the Kremlin, and preceded news of a potential U.S.-Russia summit facilitated by Saudi Arabia \u2014 raising the possibility of a deal hatched without either Ukrainians or any other<b> </b>Europeans at the table. In subsequent comments, Trump insisted his transatlantic interlocutors would not be sidelined, but also added that he wanted Russia back in diplomatic formats like the Group of Seven nations (no longer the Group of Eight since Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014).\nEuropean officials feared Trump and his lieutenants, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was in meetings on the continent, were openly giving away concessions to the Kremlin before meaningful negotiations. Both Hegseth and Trump have all but rejected the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, while the former said Ukraine would not realistically regain much of its territory lost to Russia.\n<b>Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-fledged invasion in 2022 has been locked in an existential fight for survival. </b>Kyiv won\u2019t accept foreign powers forcing concessions on it and is wary of Trump reducing Ukraine\u2019s leverage in a hypothetical deal with Russia.\n\u201cYour politicians have lost their dignity,\u201d a Ukrainian military officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/trump-putin-call-europe-ukraine-reaction/\" target=_blank>told my colleagues</a>. \u201cUkraine\u2019s betrayal after Afghanistan will have catastrophic consequences for America\u2019s perception in the world,\u201d he said, referring to the Taliban takeover that came after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nTrump doesn\u2019t seem worried about such perceptions, and has cast himself as an unorthodox peacemaker willing to have discussions and create solutions others could not. He also seems squishy on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, suggesting that the country\u2019s wealth of critical minerals should be reserved for the United States in exchange for security guarantees. In a TV interview earlier this week, he said there was a chance that Ukraine \u201cmay be Russian someday.\u201d At a White House presser Thursday evening, Trump didn\u2019t answer a journalist\u2019s question about what concessions Russia should itself make in a peace deal, but reiterated his opposition to Ukraine joining NATO.\nThe language coming out of Washington has frustrated officials in Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s appeasement. It has never worked,\u201d E.U. foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. \u201cIt is clear that any deal behind our backs will not work. Any agreement will need also Ukraine and Europe being part of it.\u201d\n\u201cTrump always speaks about \u2018peace through strength,\u2019 and that is precisely the right approach with the Russians,\u201d a senior European official <a href=\"https://archive.is/BP5sR#selection-5883.110-5887.204\" target=_blank>told the Wall Street Journal</a>. \u201cBut here we have not really seen the strength part yet.\u201d\n<b>When it comes to Gaza, Trump is even more dismissive</b>. He believes the United States would simply assume responsibility for the territory, a \u201cdemolition site,\u201d and make it into the \u201cRiviera\u201d of the Middle East, no matter the expulsion of its inhabitants. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take it, we\u2019re going to hold it, we\u2019re going to cherish it,\u201d Trump said of Gaza, while scoffing at any question of paying for it \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to buy,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ABCNews/videos/were-gonna-have-gaza-theres-nothing-to-buypres-trump-doubled-down-on-his-plan-fo/629356416166279/\" target=\"_blank\">he told reporters</a>.\nPalestinians do not see their homeland as \u201cnothing.\u201d Even amid the devastation of their homes, Gaza\u2019s traumatized population does not want to lose its rights to the land. Tensions are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/09/trump-gaza-development-intervention/\" target=_blank>fraying the fragile ceasefire</a> between Israel and militant group Hamas, raising the prospect of a resumption of Israel\u2019s bombardments that have already flattened most of the territory\u2019s civilian infrastructure and killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.\n\u201cPalestinians do not need President Trump to talk about Gaza as if it were an empty hotel room that needs redesigning,\u201d wrote Mosab Abu Toha, a Palestinian poet from Gaza, <a href=\"https://archive.is/IKTeP#selection-635.0-635.117\" target=\"_blank\">in the New Yorker</a>. He pointed to the vast humanitarian need in the territory \u2014 assistance which Israel, despite ceasefire commitments, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-says-aid-flows-into-gaza-have-risen-since-ceasefire-including-shelter-items-2025-02-11/\" target=\"_blank\">may still be restricting</a> \u2014 and the urgent need to start clearing tons of debris. \u201cThe people who shape this future need to be us Palestinians,\u201d he added, \u201cnot the people who made Gaza look like a demolition site, or who now seem to think that an entire people should be demolished, too.\u201d\nDiplomats across the Arab world have echoed this position, as have European politicians and U.N. officials. \u201cIt\u2019s strange at the moment to be in a period when statecraft seems to have been replaced by real estate craft,\u201d Tom Fletcher, the United Nations undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, said of Trump\u2019s plan in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/09/trump-gaza-development-intervention/\" target=_blank>an interview Sunday after a tour of Gaza</a>. \u201cI was asking a lot of people what they thought, and every single one of them said, \u2018We\u2019re not going anywhere. We\u2019ll rebuild our homes again and again and again as we always have done.\u2019\u201d\n<b>Trump\u2019s plans for Gaza are not just about the fancies of a real estate tycoon. </b>His apparent belief that Gaza can be emptied of its population is celebrated by the Israeli right, as prominent politicians have for months <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/05/wv-israel-hamas/\" target=\"_blank\">eyed the occupation and settlement</a> of Gaza, as well as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/25/israel-ethnic-cleansing-gaza-settlements/\" target=\"_blank\">the expulsion of its Palestinian inhabitants</a>. It \u201crewards the policies of the Israel government that is the most extremist, right-wing in the history of the Israeli state,\u201d Aaron David Miller, a veteran former U.S. diplomat who worked for decades on Israeli-Palestinian issues, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/09/trump-gaza-development-intervention/\" target=\"_blank\">told my colleague Karen DeYoung</a>.\nAnd if the political aspirations of Palestinians are irrelevant to Trump, so too are the political anxieties of Ukrainians \u2014 much to the pleasure of those in the Kremlin\u2019s inner circle. \u201cWe are entering a new 21st century, and it\u2019s not going to look like the 20th,\u201d Konstantin Malofeyev, a Russian tycoon who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions for<b> </b>his role financing pro-Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/13/trump-russia-ukraine-territory-peace-deal/\" target=_blank>told my colleagues</a>. \u201cWe are returning to the era of traditional big states, great powers and to a balance of interests.\u201d"

Kennedy Jr.</a>, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, was sworn in as health and human services secretary.\nThe Food and Drug Administration notified members of its vaccine advisory committee Wednesday that a planned March 13 meeting was canceled, according to an email sent to members that was read to The Washington Post. No reason was provided.\nThe email warned members against forwarding the email. It suggested members decline to answer questions from media.\nHHS and the FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/10/flu-cases-increase-influenza-cdc/\">Influenza viruses</a> change year to year, so vaccines must be updated annually. Federal health officials pick the flu strains that the vaccine will target in advance of the flu season because the production process takes several months.\nThe FDA usually holds a meeting of its expert panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, in March to accommodate tight manufacturing deadlines and go over discussions about flu strain selection led by the World Health Organization.\nThe FDA advisory panel meeting includes public presentations from WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Defense, said Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and a critic of Kennedy\u2019s.\n\u201cWhat is the plan for picking this year\u2019s flu strain?\u201d Offit said.\nLast week, Trump officials <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/\">postponed</a> a three-day meeting of the vaccine advisory panel to the CDC that was scheduled to begin Wednesday.\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Kennedy repeatedly denied that he is anti-vaccine, contending that he is simply seeking more data and pledging not to undermine confidence in the shots. But public health experts have long warned that as HHS secretary, Kennedy could use his authority to undermine vaccine safety and effectiveness. A pivotal swing vote in Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) said he grappled with his vote but later said he had received a list of commitments from Kennedy that included protecting vaccine oversight.\nKennedy was critical of the CDC vaccine panel during his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/30/rfk-health-secretary-confirmation-hearings/\">confirmation process</a> and has argued that federal agencies are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/18/trump-health-firings-fda-cdc/\">captive</a> to the industries they regulate.\n\u201cWe will remove conflicts of interest on the committees and research partners whenever possible, or balance them with other stakeholders,\u201d Kennedy said in remarks to HHS staff earlier this month.\nAn executive order issued by President Donald Trump last week to reduce federal bureaucracy said White House officials would identify \u201cunnecessary governmental entities and Federal Advisory Committees that should be terminated on grounds that they are unnecessary.\u201d"

        "content": "With President Donald Trump and GOP leaders distracted by other issues, Congress is on the verge of bungling its way into a shutdown of federal agencies in less than three weeks.\nTrump and his advisers, particularly Elon Musk, have devoted the first month in office to trying to rip apart federal agencies that they don\u2019t like while also upending traditional foreign policy alliances. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) have battled over how fast to move all of Trump\u2019s agenda, including at least $4.5 trillion in tax cuts at a time when the national debt is ballooning.\nBut those issues are likely to take months to fully negotiate and navigate through complex procedures. The most pressing problem \u2014 keeping the federal government open past the March 14 deadline \u2014 has been virtually ignored by top leaders.\nAnd unlike the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/20/government-shutdown-bill-continuing-resolution/\" target=\"_blank\">most recent shutdown</a> deadlines, the politics of the moment are not aligned to bring the two parties together with an obvious last-minute deal that simply adds more money for each side\u2019s favored projects.\nInstead, many Democrats have grown so livid about Trump and Musk\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/08/elon-musk-doge-federal-agencies-cuts-employees/\" target=_blank>dismantling of agencies</a> such as the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 ignoring laws approved by Congress and signed by previous presidents \u2014 that many Democrats say <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/09/democrats-government-shutdown-trump-musk/\" target=_blank>they will oppose</a> a new round of government funding without guarantees that Trump and Musk will abide by these laws.\nIn outlining what they are seeking, Sen. Patty Murray (Washington), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, <a href=\"https://x.com/jackfitzdc/status/1892645594465710532\" target=_blank>summed it up thus on Thursday</a>: \u201cSimply an assurance that, if there\u2019s going to be Democratic votes, that the president and Elon Musk will follow the law and they won\u2019t just take our bill that we worked really hard on and rip it up.\u201d\nRepublicans know that without any Democratic votes, the government will shut down. To boot, at least a half dozen anti-government conservatives in the House, sometimes several dozen, refuse to vote for even the most basic bill funding the government.\nJohnson\u2019s historically narrow majority affords him just one defection to pass something with only Republican votes.\n\u201cRepublicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. It is their responsibility to find the votes to pass the final measures,\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Connecticut), the ranking minority-party member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement provided to The Washington Post on Friday.\nDeLauro labeled Musk \u201can unchecked billionaire\u201d whose actions have turned this negotiation from a relatively easy one to \u201cnot normal times\u201d with a high degree of risk.\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who spent 28 years climbing the Appropriations Committee ladder to finally secure the chair\u2019s gavel last month, summed up the dire state of play.\n\u201cI believe we\u2019re at impasse. We\u2019ve made four good-faith offers,\u201d Collins told reporters in the Capitol, adding that the Democrats have not made a real counteroffer. \u201cWe\u2019ve received only a perfunctory response.\u201d\nThe divide is epitomized by a pair of collegial committee members who usually forge deals but instead are now casting blame.\nSen. Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) noted that there is general agreement on funding levels that mirror <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/09/30/government-shutdown-averted/\" target=_blank>a deal worked out in 2023</a>. Republicans are willing to divvy up agency funds at those levels even though the leaders who negotiated that pact \u2014 Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy \u2014 are no longer in office.\n\u201cIf the Democrats want to do a shutdown, they can do it by simply refusing to move forward,\u201d Rounds said.\nSen. Chris Coons (D-Delaware) grew livid at the suggestion that Democrats are blocking a deal.\n\u201cLook, the Trump administration is already shutting the government down,\u201d Coons said.\nIn recent years, he oversaw funding dedicated to USAID and other foreign aid programs, Coons said. \u201cIt has specific and concrete language that says you cannot restructure USAID without congressional approval. They just did it. They just did it. So this is not hypothetical. It is not hyperbole. It is a completely understandable concern.\u201d\nThe Democrats are demanding an agreement written into the package to require Trump to abide by these spending bill outlines. That is the sort of thing that resides above the pay grade of the House and Senate Appropriations committee leaders.\nThose types of \u201criders,\u201d as they are known by insiders, require negotiations among Thune, Johnson and their Democratic counterparts, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (New York) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (New York), as well as the administration.\nBut Trump is not paying close attention to insider machinations on Capitol Hill. Johnson and Thune\u2019s spat has gone on for almost three months now, over one or two bills using the fast-track route to pass legislation on party-line votes.\nEach time Trump has seemed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/07/trump-backs-one-big-beautiful-bill-perils-await/\" target=_blank>to force a path</a> \u2014 like his social media posts Wednesday morning <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/20/senate-budget-trump-tax-cuts-deportations/479e78ec-efe2-11ef-bd80-8f2ac5c75a8a_story.html\" target=_blank>supporting Johnson\u2019s one \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d</a> \u2014 he contradicts the decision soon after. (Early Wednesday afternoon, Vice President JD Vance met with GOP senators and gave them the green light to continue their two-bill approach.)\nTrump has spent more<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/11/17/donald-trump-pga-liv-golf/?utm_campaign=wp_sports&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter\" target=_blank> personal time</a> trying to negotiate a truce to professional golf\u2019s civil war \u2014 including <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/20/pga-tour-saudi-pif-trump-white-house/\" target=_blank>a three-hour meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday that included Tiger Woods</a> \u2014 than he has dedicated to trying to hammer out a deal to keep the government funded.\nThune devoted the past week to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/21/senate-budget-border-trump-immigration/\" target=_blank>Senate passage of a budget resolution</a> that is a first step on the way toward increased border and defense spending. If successful that way, Thune would come back later in the year to pass another GOP-only bill including tax cuts.\nJohnson is aiming in the coming weeks to pass the House\u2019s budget resolution, trying to wrap all of the GOP\u2019s priorities into one massive bill.\nEven if he succeeds, Johnson\u2019s plan would then instruct committees to spend a few months pulling together all the legislation before returning to the House floor to consider the massive package.\nNone of those actions would do anything to avert<b> </b>the shutdown iceberg that is dead ahead.\nAll of this could have been handled in December, at the end of Biden\u2019s presidency, as the appropriators had a rough spending outline ready to divide up more than $1.7 trillion in agency budgets.\nBut Johnson, fearing a revolt from the far-right flank, ordered up a punt on the funding bills until March 14 so that he could secure <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/03/house-speaker-vote-live-updates/\" target=_blank>enough votes on Jan. 3 </a>for another term as speaker.\nMurray has not been shy about sending out warning flares that a real deadline is fast approaching.\n\u201cI would urge my Republican colleagues to get serious and keep your eye on the ball regarding the funding lapse on March 14,\u201d she said <a href=\"https://www.murray.senate.gov/in-senate-budget-committee-republicans-block-murray-amendments-for-bipartisan-approach-to-spending-affirming-congressional-spending-authority-reversing-nih-cuts-transparency-accountability-f/\" target=\"_blank\">during a Feb. 12 Senate Budget Committee hearing</a> on Thune\u2019s budget proposal.\nSome congressional insiders fear that a prolonged shutdown is something that Musk and the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought \u2014 whose roots come from working for the most far-right House Republicans \u2014 would cheer on. Musk, an unelected adviser with vast power, has so far not worried about the consequences of mass firings of workers in charge of air safety and those administering crucial foreign aid abroad.\nAnd this shutdown could be much more painful than the nearly five-week version during Trump\u2019s first term that started in late 2018. That shutdown partially shuttered some federal agencies, although critical entities, such as the Pentagon, already had their annual budgets approved and remained open.\nThis year, a mid-March shutdown would leave every agency without funding, keeping only those employees deemed essential at their posts. Even those key federal workers still at their jobs, such as Border Patrol agents and military troops stationed abroad, would be working without pay.\nCollins, who voted to convict Trump in the 2021 impeachment trial, indicated she opposes the Democratic bid to write binding language into the spending bills.\n\u201cWhen bills like this are done, the rule in the past has been no poison pills, no new riders,\u201d she told reporters.\nCoons doesn\u2019t even know how Democrats would write such a guarantee into legislation, given that it is already the law.\n\u201cI mean, it is demonstrably the law that when we pass an appropriations bill, and the president signs it into law, it has the force of law,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to follow it.\u201d"

The Republican governor, who occasionally <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/03/23/utah-cox-transgender-athlete-veto/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwY2xjawIrMrVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHZD5IgYgTW1mXm3PPM2X3SeBkNNMqArWGTijzUvNjiZbzxekMCUE2Mmxkg_aem_NA3_iem9lK2GmT-Rb8ocXw\" target=_blank>breaks </a>from party lines, has until the end of March to sign or veto the bill; if he takes no action, it will lapse into law.\nUtah\u2019s potentially unprecedented move comes at a time of renewed attention to the practice of adding fluoride to drinking water: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/14/robert-f-kennedy-jr-hhs-secretary/\" target=_blank>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, the newly appointed Health and Human Services secretary, has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/03/rfk-jr-trump-fluoride-water/\" target=_blank>assailed </a>the practice, alleging that it can harm brain development and bones.\nWhile this isn\u2019t the first time communities have fought over fluoride, which was first used in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the issue has historically been hyperlocal, rather than partisan. Democrat-majority<b> </b>states, such as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/20/rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-oregon/\" target=\"_blank\">Oregon </a>and New Jersey, have some of the lowest fluoridation rates, while states where Republicans predominate, including Kentucky and South Carolina, boast some of the highest.\nMost Americans drink fluoridated water, including about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2024/fluoride-water-mandates/\" target=_blank>half of Utah residents</a>. The process of adjusting fluoride quantities to recommended levels \u2014 known as community water fluoridation \u2014 reduces oral health disparities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most communities that add the mineral do so voluntarily, but about a dozen states require fluoridation. Some of those mandates have been in place for more than 50 years.\nIn Utah, residents who receive fluoridated water \u2014 in Salt Lake County, Davis County and Brigham City \u2014 experience tooth decay at rates 25 to 50 percent lower than other residents, according to the Utah Dental Association. The group blasted the bill, urging residents to call Cox\u2019s office to demand a veto.\n\u201cHouse Bill 81 would adopt public policy that is in complete opposition to effectively decreasing dental decay and strengthening teeth enamel,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.uda.org/government-affairs/call-to-governor-cox-to-veto-hb-81\" target=_blank>the group said</a>.\nThe group\u2019s national counterpart, the American Dental Association, sent a letter to Cox on Tuesday to similarly urge a veto.\n\u201cUtah would be the only state to end this preventive health practice that has been in place for over three quarters of a century,\u201d the group <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/-/media/Project/ADA%20Organization/ADA/ADA-org/Files/Advocacy/Prevention%20and%20Education/utah_cwf_bill_veto_letter_20250225.pdf\" target=_blank>wrote</a>. \u201cThe Utah measure proposes to take the unprecedented step of ending one of the most trusted and tested public health strategies in the arsenal of preventive medicine.\u201d\nUtah Rep. Stephanie Gricius (R), the bill\u2019s sponsor, said the legislation is about choice.\n\u201cCommunity water fluoridation does not allow for informed consent which is a crucial component of good, healthcare policy,\u201d she wrote in an email to The Washington Post, adding that she is \u201chopeful\u201d that Cox will sign the bill, \u201cgiven the broad support from both legislative bodies.\u201d\nDays before the presidential election, Kennedy signaled that a<b> </b>future Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/03/rfk-jr-trump-fluoride-water/\" target=\"_blank\">would advise</a> water districts to remove fluoride, which he <a href=\"https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923\" target=\"_blank\">referred to</a> as \u201can industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease.\u201d Medical organizations said Kennedy\u2019s assertions are unfounded; Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-banning-vaccines-president-rfk-fluoride-rcna178570\" target=\"_blank\">supported</a> the idea.\nThe federal government<b> </b>does not mandate fluoridation or directly control local water systems, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2024/fluoride-water-mandates/\" target=_blank>experts have said</a> the Trump administration could influence communities across the country to reconsider decades-old fluoridation programs."

        "content": "The airspace along the Potomac River where an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/30/dc-plane-crash-updates-helicopter-potomac-reagan-airport/\" target=_blank>Army helicopter and an airliner crashed</a> Wednesday night poses some of the most complex challenges in the country for pilots, requiring them to rely on layers of procedures and electronic safeguards to avoid a catastrophe.\nMilitary and Coast Guard helicopters frequently fly low over the river, sharing the skies with planes on the heavily used takeoff and landing routes for Washington\u2019s Reagan National Airport. Congestion in the skies and on runways and taxiways around the airport has raised safety concerns for years. National was built to handle 15 million passengers annually; it now handles 25 million.\nDennis Tajer, an American Airlines captain, said that means pilots have to be at their best when flying into the airport.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beehive of activity,\u201d said Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, American\u2019s pilot union. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely compact, and it\u2019s a high volume of traffic.\u201d\n\nSomehow, the many safeguards failed Wednesday when the Black Hawk helicopter on a training mission and the American Airlines flight from Wichita collided hundreds of feet above the river as the commercial plane approached its runway for landing.\nNo survivors were found from among the 64 people on the plane and three service members aboard the helicopter, authorities said.<b> </b>Experts said the initial accounts of the crash are likely to raise questions about the heavily trafficked airspace, communications between the two aircraft and air traffic controllers and whether industry and government responses to near collisions on runways across the country were sufficient.\n\n\u201cWe know the system has been under duress,\u201d said Tajer, who does not represent pilots at American subsidiary PSA Airlines, which was involved in the crash.\nThere are designated routes for helicopters flying around the Washington region that tend to follow the area\u2019s<b> </b>rivers. It appeared that the helicopter that collided with the airliner Wednesday was in or near one of those routes along the eastern bank of the Potomac, according to Scott Dunham, a retired National Transportation Safety Board investigator. Air traffic controllers also help manage traffic and were in contact with the helicopter, according to audio recordings archived by <a href=\"http://liveatc.net/\" target=_blank>LiveATC.net</a>.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a corridor where helicopters are allowed to fly at a low level,\u201d said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration investigator. How the routes and altitudes of both aircraft intersected in the moments before the collision will be closely scrutinized.\nAs another layer of protection against midair collisions, airliners are equipped with the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, which issues automated verbal alerts to pilots to avoid an imminent crash. Experts said it will be up to investigators to determine whether the pilots received any warnings from the system, whether the military aircraft was detected by the system or whether it was providing alerts at such a low altitude with many other aircraft around.\nAs planes approach the ground, the system gradually limits the number of alerts it provides to avoid distracting pilots, according to retired United Airlines pilot Ross Aimer.\nThe crash occurred in one of the most sensitive air corridors in the country, many of whose operations are classified because of security considerations given the proximity to the White House, Capitol, Pentagon and numerous other civilian and military facilities. The region is home to three major airports, 11 regional airports and 55 heliports, not including those operated by the military.\n\nAccording to a 2021 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/gao-report-on-helicopter-noise-in-the-d-c-region/d13a6d80-2eef-4a34-a4fe-a42705ce134e/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18\" target=_blank>report to Congress,</a> 50 entities operated roughly 88,000 helicopter flights between 2017 and 2019, based on FAA data. Most were tied to the military, but others included flights by medical operations, state and local law enforcement, and federal agencies.\nLawmakers<b> </b>proposed in 2023 to add more flights at National to serve new long-distance routes. Opponents of the idea raised questions about safety.\nLast year, as part of legislation to fund the FAA, Congress added five round-trip flights. The decision came over the objections of members of the D.C.-area congressional delegation, who have long argued that the airport is at capacity.\nU.S. airlines have had a strong safety record in recent years, with the last mass-fatality crash occurring in 2009. Federal aviation officials have scrambled to respond to a spate of near collisions at airports around the country that began in 2023. Industry leaders said they were a warning sign that there was risk of a crash as air traffic bounced back from pandemic-era lows.\nThe FAA has investigated at least three close calls at National in recent years. Two occurred in quick succession last year, heightening concerns. In one, air traffic controllers instructed a Southwest jet to cross a runway while a JetBlue plane was starting its takeoff roll down the same runway. In a second incident, an American Airlines jet preparing for takeoff nearly collided with a King Air plane that was landing on a shorter runway nearby. The FAA was investigating both incidents.\nMichael McCormick, an associate professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University who specializes in air traffic control, said complacency about the airport\u2019s complicated traffic patterns and lower nighttime staffing levels for air traffic controllers could be a factor.\n\u201cThis is an avoidable and unfortunate tragedy,\u201d McCormick said."

        "headline": "Democratic AGs score early wins against Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship ban",
        "content": "Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, the son of Chinese immigrants, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/-first-sue-opposing-trumps-desire-end-birthright-citizenship-personal-rcna184891\" target=\"_blank\">laid down a marker</a> when asked in December about Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to end birthright citizenship: \u201cI would be the first to sue.\u201d\nThree weeks later, he was the first \u2014 but he was not standing alone.\nBehind the scenes, Tong and fellow Democratic attorneys general from 21 states and D.C. had signed a confidential \u201ccommon interest agreement\u201d to share information, collaborate on legal briefs and join forces on litigation to fight Trump on a potential U.S. citizenship ban. Their arrangement took effect Nov. 14, just nine days after the presidential election, according to a copy of the document obtained by The Washington Post.\nThat early partnership and planning has paid off. At a time when congressional Democrats have appeared politically flat-footed in response to the shock-and-awe tactics of Trump\u2019s first month in the White House, this group of attorneys general has responded with a legal fire wall on a case that has become one of the first clear examples of a coordinated resistance to the administration\u2019s extraordinary efforts to expand presidential power and challenge constitutional limits.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit recently <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/20/trump-birthright-citizenship-appeal-case/\" target=_blank>upheld a Seattle judge\u2019s nationwide injunction</a> on Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship order in one of the two cases brought by the Democratic states. Judges in both of those cases, and two others brought by civil rights groups, have issued injunctions. Legal experts said the issue could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\u201cWe did not wake up the day after the election and say, \u2018Oh, no, what are we going to do now?\u2019\u201d Tong said in a recent interview. \u201cNobody was taking any chances, so, sure, we were talking about the possibility that Trump would win, and he telegraphed all the things he wanted to do during the campaign. What I said to people after he was elected is that, as a minimum response, we should take him at his word that he will do everything that he said he was going to do. And so he has.\u201d\nThe legal challenge to Trump\u2019s attempted ban is part of a broader effort by Democratic attorneys general, who have now teamed up on eight multistate lawsuits against Trump\u2019s actions and scored some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/trump-lawsuits-executive-orders-actions-legal-challenges/\" target=_blank>key early wins in federal court</a>. They say they are prepared for a long, sustained legal fight, one informed by lessons learned during Trump\u2019s first administration, in which the Democratic states were slower to act collectively.\nMost legal scholars say the citizenship clause of the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment grants birthright citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil other than the children of foreign diplomats. Trump\u2019s order, which seeks to ban it for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreigners in the country on temporary visas, could affect more than 150,000 newborns annually, according to some independent studies.\nStarting early last year, the attorneys general say, their offices began to communicate about how to establish a legal bulwark against Trump\u2019s campaign promises to take unprecedented executive actions. Birthright citizenship, which Trump discussed frequently on the campaign trail, emerged as a likely early target and an issue on which the Democratic attorneys general believed they were on firm legal footing.\nLegal scholars have overwhelmingly called the matter settled law, pointing to an 1898 Supreme Court ruling that Wong Kim Ark, the San Francisco-born son of Chinese immigrants who was denied reentry to the country, was a U.S. citizen.\nThe attorneys general also examined the road map laid out in Project 2025, a blueprint for expanding presidential authority published by the conservative Heritage Foundation.\nTheir preparation was evident after Trump, on his first day in office, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/\" target=\"_blank\">signed an executive order</a> seeking to curb automatic citizenship.\nThe next day, all 22 Democratic states, along with D.C. and the city of San Francisco, challenged the order as unconstitutional in a pair of federal lawsuits \u2014 a 32-page filing in Seattle and a 50-page filing in Boston. Judges in both cases have issued nationwide injunctions against Trump\u2019s order, with the Seattle judge calling it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/06/trump-birthright-citizenship/\" target=_blank>\u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d</a>\n\u201cWe drafted the bulk of the lawsuit before the president signed his order at 8 o\u2019clock at night. When he signed it, we were ready to go, and we filed the next morning,\u201d said New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, who along with Tong and Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell took the lead in the Boston case. \u201cIt was a function of the work and collaboration we had done over the better part of a year.\u201d\nWashington state, which led the challenge to Trump\u2019s travel ban for immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries during his first term, took the lead on the Seattle filing on the birthright lawsuit last month. The state\u2019s attorney general, Nick Brown, said his office had done a significant amount of work on the issue and shared it with colleagues in other offices. Oregon, Illinois and Arizona joined Washington in filing that case.\n\u201cWe had both substantive expertise and interest in doing that, and our office communicated early on that we wanted to take a leadership role,\u201d Brown said. He noted that his office, with more than 800 attorneys, is one of the largest in the nation. \u201cWe felt like we had a good case to make here.\u201d\nTheir strategy to confront Trump on birthright citizenship and other issues reflects an accelerating pattern of multistate challenges against the federal government brought largely along party lines, said Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University, who <a href=\"https://attorneysgeneral.org/multistate-lawsuits-vs-the-federal-government/list-of-lawsuits-1980-present/\" target=_blank>maintains a database</a> to track such cases.\nHe identified 76 multistate lawsuits during President George W. Bush\u2019s eight years in office and 80 in President Barack Obama\u2019s two terms. The numbers skyrocketed to 160 cases during Trump\u2019s first term and 133 in President Joe Biden\u2019s four-year tenure.\n\u201cAGs are suing over just about everything \u2014 every major policy, every regulation, every attempt to reverse a previous administration,\u201d Nolette said. He added that the increasingly prominent role of judges, in lieu of Congress, in establishing federal policy is unhealthy for a democratic system.\nTrump\u2019s allies argue that birthright citizenship offers an incentive for immigrants to try to enter the United States illegally and helps them fight deportation once they give birth here. While 89 percent of the public supports deporting undocumented immigrants with violent criminal records, just 30 percent are in favor of removing parents whose children are U.S. citizens, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2025/02/19/feb-13-18-2025-washington-post-ipsos-poll/\" target=_blank>a recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll</a>.\nMike Howell, executive director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Oversight Project, said the intensive focus of the Democratic attorneys general on the birthright citizenship issue demonstrated what he called their \u201cnakedly political\u201d interests around immigration. He suggested Democrats are interested in maintaining a core voting constituency by ensuring more immigrants gain citizenship, a theory for which there is no evidence.\nIndependent polling has found that illegal immigration to the United States is driven by migrants seeking better economic opportunity and freedom from political persecution in their home countries.\n\u201cIt is not surprising to see they have such an agreement,\u201d Howell said, referring to the legal agreement the attorneys general signed in November. \u201cWhat this document does is confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt the priority of this \u2014 a major muscle movement to get this many states on one document together.\u201d\nTong scoffed at the notion that the coordinated effort aimed to consolidate the votes of immigrant communities. \u201cThis was a direct attack on people, on babies, on children, on families in Connecticut,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople viscerally understand that. This was not a hard one for me.\u201d\nCivil rights groups also have filed six lawsuits challenging the birthright citizenship order. Advocates said they try to coordinate with the states, which have much larger staffs and can bring broader claims of potential harm.\nThe civil rights groups are representing pregnant individuals whose children would be denied citizenship, while the states have argued that they would lose federal revenue to help provide public benefits for the children and be tasked with new administrative burdens to help enforce Trump\u2019s order.\nThe states also are getting support from blue cities, including San Francisco, where City Attorney David Chiu said his support of the states\u2019 birthright citizenship lawsuit is based in part on the city\u2019s history in the Wong Kim Ark case.\n\u201cOur office wants to make sure the story \u2026 is told accurately and litigated fully,\u201d said Chiu, who is in touch with Wong\u2019s descendants. The family, he said, is \u201chorrified at the idea that the 14th Amendment and that case could be summarily ignored by the president of the United States.\u201d"

        "content": "The billionaire family that owns Purdue Pharma, maker of the pain medication blamed for helping fuel the nation\u2019s opioid crisis, has agreed to increase payments to settle long-running litigation against the company, promising to pay $6.5 billion over 15 years as part of a deal announced Thursday by several state attorneys general.\nThe deal comes after the Supreme Court in June blocked a controversial bankruptcy plan for Purdue that shielded Sackler family members \u2014 who themselves did not file for bankruptcy \u2014 from future opioid lawsuits in exchange for paying up to $6 billion over 18 years.\nThe new deal, if approved by a New York federal bankruptcy judge and state courts, will allow governments and victims who don\u2019t agree to the settlement to pursue lawsuits against the Sacklers. The agreement also calls for setting aside an initial $200 million \u2014 and up to $800 million \u2014 to use toward defending the Sacklers against those future claims, according to the offices of the New York and Connecticut attorneys general; money not used after five years would begin to revert to states.\n\u201cI have said since Day 1 that this fight has been about justice and accountability for the hundreds of thousands of victims and families wrecked by the opioid epidemic,\u201d Connecticut Attorney General William Tong <a href=\"https://portal.ct.gov/ag/press-releases/2025-press-releases/purdue-pharma-and-sackler-family-settlement-in-principle\" target=_blank>said</a> in a statement. \u201cThere will never be enough justice or dollars to restore those families or right this terrible wrong.\u201d\nThe total deal is worth $7.4 billion, with Purdue contributing nearly $900 million to pay governments and victims. If approved, a significant portion of the money will be paid within three years, state officials said.\nThe company, in a statement, said the new agreement will deliver billions of dollars to \u201ccompensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver treatment and overdose rescue medicines that will save lives.\u201d Representatives from multiple branches of the Sackler family did not reply to requests for comment.\nThe announcement adds another chapter to the winding legal saga involving the pharmaceutical company that earned billions of dollars from the blockbuster painkiller OxyContin as sales representatives in the late 1990s and early 2000s aggressively marketed the drug while downplaying the risk of addiction. Purdue, facing a tsunami of lawsuits from governments, tribes, hospitals, opioid victims and others, filed for bankruptcy in 2019, pausing legal claims against the company.\nSackler family members have denied wrongdoing or personal responsibility, although two branches of the family in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/03/10/opioid-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-sackler/\" target=_blank>an earlier statement</a> to a bankruptcy court expressed regret that \u201cOxyContin, a prescription medicine that continues to help people suffering from chronic pain, unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis that has brought grief and loss to far too many families and communities.\u201d\nLawsuits against Purdue and the Sacklers have loomed as part of wider litigation against pharmaceutical companies, drug distributors, pharmacy retail chains, pharmacy benefit managers and others accused of helping fuel the nation\u2019s opioid crisis. Governments have alleged that the distributors and pharmacies failed to flag suspicious orders of prescription opioids, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/10/opioids-ohio-supreme-court-cvs-walgreens-walmart/\" target=_blank>stretching thin</a> the public safety and health resources of communities hard hit by addiction.\nCompanies have agreed to about $50 billion in settlements \u2014 money intended to help communities ease the effects of the epidemic by paying for overdose reversal medications, addiction treatment, education, police resources and other uses.\nPurdue\u2019s initial bankruptcy plan proved controversial, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/12/03/purdue-pharma-supreme-court-bankruptcy-settlement/\" target=_blank>dividing families</a> who have lost relatives to addiction and drug overdoses. Supporters insisted that the deal would provide much-needed money to communities to address the epidemic. They pointed out that nearly all the creditors who voted on the plan approved of the deal.\nCritics asserted the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/10/14/sackler-family-opioids-legal-strategy-lawsuits/\" target=_blank>Sacklers</a>, who withdrew $11 billion from the company in the years leading up to the bankruptcy, were not paying enough and would avoid civil trials. The family has long said the withdrawals were lawful and nearly half was paid to taxes.\nThe Justice Department objected, saying bankruptcy law did not allow the Sacklers to get shielded from lawsuits from future parties who did not consent. A divided<b> </b>Supreme Court in June <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/27/purdue-pharma-supreme-court-opioid-bankruptcy/\" target=_blank>ruled</a> in the Justice Department\u2019s favor.\nThe new deal hashed out through court-ordered mediation mirrors the previous plan in key ways. The family would relinquish control of Purdue, which would be refashioned into a company whose earnings would go toward curbing the opioid epidemic. Millions of internal Purdue documents chronicling the company\u2019s role in the opioid crisis would be made public.\nThe settlement \u201crepresents justice for the untold victims who suffered because the Sacklers put profits above people,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.\nThe new settlement will also pay between $800 million and $850 million in total compensation to opioid victims, a boost from the previous figure, which allowed for payments of up to $750 million.\n\u201cThe new settlement is an improvement over the old one, but for those who say this is a vindication of the government\u2019s senseless appeals \u2026 the hundreds of victims who lost their lives because of the delay, would beg to differ,\u201d said Edward Neiger, an attorney who represents a committee made up of thousands of victims.\n\nMore than a dozen states \u2014 including California, Florida, New York and Virginia \u2014 participated in the talks and must now seek participation from other states and local governments who have sued. Some governments may roll the dice at trial. For instance, Nassau County, New York, has \u201cmade it clear the Sacklers will be in a courtroom in New York regardless of this new effort to derail a jury trial,\u201d said attorney Hunter Shkolnik, who represents the county.\nRelatives of some opioid victims also criticized the deal.\nSince 2000, hundreds of thousands have died in the United States of prescription opioid overdoses, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The crisis recently has evolved into an even deadlier phase, marked by the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl that typically are illegally manufactured and imported.\nEd Bisch, who lost his son to an overdose and runs a group called Relatives Against Purdue Pharma, said victims \u201cpaid with their lives and get peanuts in the end \u2014 while states collect billions in blood money.\u201d"

But whether men are more romantic in real life may depend on how you define romanticism, as well as the cultural, societal and other expectations that may influence romantic behaviors, some experts said.\nIn American culture, there is often an expectation that men plan and pay for the date, buy the flowers and pull out the chair, said <a href=\"https://kinseyinstitute.org/about/profiles/jgarcia.php\">Justin Garcia</a>, executive director of the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University.\n\u201cEven as we\u2019ve seen more gender egalitarian tendencies in dating,\u201d he added, there are \u201cstill a lot of gender norms around that. It makes it, in many ways, appear like men do more romantic things because they\u2019re expected to.\u201d\nExpectations aside, \u201cI think men are more romantic than they\u2019re often given credit for,\u201d said Garcia, an evolutionary biologist and sex researcher.\nResearch has not suggested that men may be more romantic than women across the board. But in <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407589064001\">a 1989 study</a> that developed the romantic beliefs scale, which is widely used in research to measure how strongly someone agrees or disagrees with romantic ideas such as love at first sight, researchers noted that, generally, men were more likely than women to endorse the ideology of romanticism and hold romantic beliefs.\nOther research suggests that men have a tendency to <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/romantic-relationships-matter-more-to-men-than-to-women/52E626D3CD7DB14CD946F9A2FBDA739C\">strive harder to establish romantic relationships</a> and benefit more from them, to be the first to <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0022412\">say \u201cI love you\u201d</a> and to <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/romantic-relationships-matter-more-to-men-than-to-women/52E626D3CD7DB14CD946F9A2FBDA739C\">suffer more</a> from love lost. Many studies are limited in that they are self-reported surveys, represent smaller subsets of the overall population and often focus on heterosexual relationships.\nIn <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/romantic-relationships-matter-more-to-men-than-to-women/52E626D3CD7DB14CD946F9A2FBDA739C\">examining</a> numerous psychological and sociological studies on gender differences in relationships, researchers noted last year that one possible explanation may be that men tend to rely more on their significant others for emotional support and are less likely to seek it outside of their romantic relationships.\nA 2021 <a href=\"https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/\">survey</a> reported that men are significantly less likely than women to share their personal feelings or receive emotional support from a friend.\nDespite the research suggesting that men tend to hold more romantic ideals, women are often perceived in society as more romantic, said Gwendolyn Seidman, a visiting scholar in the department of psychology at Michigan State University. Seidman said this may be because women tend to view themselves as <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laura-Madson/publication/14014155_Models_of_the_self_Self-construals_and_gender/links/02bfe513dfaae80869000000/Models-of-the-self-Self-construals-and-gender.pdf\">being connected to their romantic partners</a>, crave more <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407599165002\">closeness and connection</a> in romantic relationships, and put more effort into maintenance \u2014 thinking about the relationship, seeking social support and initiating discussions about the relationship, <a href=\"https://interpersona.psychopen.eu/index.php/interpersona/article/view/3467\">one study suggested</a>.\nTechnically, \u201cthat\u2019s different from being romantic,\u201d Seidman said.\nIn relationship<b> </b>research, romanticism refers to general beliefs about love, rather than actions taken within romantic relationships, Seidman said. \u201cBelieving in love at first sight or that we all have only one true love doesn\u2019t relate to how much effort you put into your actual relationship day in and day out,\u201d she said.\nWhile there are notable differences in how men and women think about, approach and engage in romantic relationships, it is important to remember that romanticism may mean different things to different couples, some experts said.\nWhat matters is that both men and women tend to want the same things out of their relationships, said <a href=\"https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/paul-eastwick\">Paul Eastwick</a>, a professor of psychology at the University of California at<b> </b>Davis.\n\u201cThe same things that make men happy are going to be the same things that make women happy \u2014 having somebody who has your back, somebody you can go to when you\u2019ve had successes, be with you when times are hard, somebody who\u2019s exciting and makes you laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is not a shred of evidence that men and women differ in the extent to which they care about those things.\u201d\nWhat else you should know:\nIn the spirit of Valentine\u2019s Day, The Washington Post asked readers to share stories about a significant other\u2019s most romantic gesture, and we were swept away by them. Here are some of our favorites, lightly edited for style and clarity:\n\u201cMy boyfriend has to ship out for two months. He made the most adorable handmade cards for each week he\u2019s gone, based around inside jokes, favorite memories, etc. He also got me a piece of jewelry referencing my favorite song for our anniversary (\u2018Call It What You Want\u2019 by Taylor Swift).\u201d <i>\u2014 Allie Young, 19, Massachusetts</i>\n\u201cJoining me on trips to see my father in hospice states away. It\u2019s not a romantic gesture as people might think, but is an act of support and love \u2014 love for me, for our relationship, for my family, and for my dad. She has also willingly given up our date nights so we can take my dad\u2019s wife out to dinner \u2026 her love extends to everyone she knows and meets, and that is the most wildly romantic thing I could ever imagine!\u201d <i>\u2014 Jonathan Cooper, 50, Pennsylvania</i>\n\u201cWith finals looming last semester, seasonal depression slowly started to get to me, and anyone who came into my dorm room could tell. Clothes piled high on the floor, and the pile on my twin sized bed often toppled into its companion pile. I did not have the motivation to do anything about it. But I came back one day to a clean room. My boyfriend had texted my roommate who let him in. He folded my clothes and hung my pants up on hangers in my wardrobe. It truly is the small things.\u201d <i>\u2014 Zachary Clifton, 19, Connecticut</i>\n\u201cIn fourth grade, a quiet, slender, blond little boy moved from California to our small Arkansas town. When Valentine\u2019s rolled around that first year he was there, among the store-bought cards I received was a red homemade Valentine. It opened to reveal a hand-drawn and colored Queen of Hearts playing card. Across the Valentine was written, \u2018You are the Queen of Hearts in my life.\u2019 It was from that adorable new boy, Jonathan. I was overwhelmed and showed the Valentine to my family. I wanted so badly to tell him that I had a huge crush on him, too, but I was too bashful. I never said a word about it or how I loved it to him. We both graduated, went to separate colleges and married other people. I kept Jonathan\u2019s Valentine well into my 30s. Jump to my 25-year class reunion: I was divorced, and Jonathan showed up, in the midst of a divorce. We had not seen each other since graduation night. The first thing I asked him was, \u2018Do you remember that Valentine you gave me in fourth grade?\u2019 He did. We got married two years later and have been married for 11 years now. He is my forever Valentine.\u201d <i>\u2014 Mary Katherine Foy, 56, Texas</i>\nThe bottom line:\nWhile some research suggests that there is a greater tendency for men to hold certain romantic beliefs such as love at first sight, romanticism is significantly influenced by<b> </b>cultural, societal, generational and individual relationship dynamics, experts said."

Ali gave the government until 11:59 p.m. Wednesday to fulfill its contractual obligations and restart payments to contractors whose work in impoverished parts of the world had been largely stopped during an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/21/usaid-trump-freeze-food-foreign-aid/\">ongoing legal battle</a>. Administration officials must also provide examples of communication sent to partners on the ground about resuming assistance, Ali ruled.\nHis order applies to work done before Feb. 13.\nAid groups that are plaintiffs in the case provided evidence that the government has not lifted its suspension of funding, Ali said, and the defendants did not rebut that Tuesday.\nThe administration filed a notice of appeal late Tuesday afternoon. A spokesman has said officials will not discuss the pending litigation outside of court.\nDuring the contentious 90-minute hearing, Justice Department lawyer Indraneel Sur told Ali he was \u201cnot in a position to answer\u201d whether the Trump administration had taken needed steps to allow the assistance to begin moving. Sur said the administration would provide further details in a status report due at noon Wednesday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t get a straight answer from you,\u201d Ali responded. \u201cWe are now 12 days in.

Separately, the U.N. World Food Program \u2014 the largest distributor of food aid \u2014 is owed more than $820 million, officials confirmed this week.\nMore than 10 days of delays have wreaked havoc on some of the world\u2019s poorest and sickest communities.

Those in famine-stricken areas of Sudan and other countries <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/\">are without food</a>.\nIn an emergency request Monday, the partner organizations said they face possible eviction and threats to worker safety because of the administration\u2019s ongoing defiance of Ali\u2019s federal court order.\n\u201cWhat the government has revealed is that the government has done nothing to make the flow of payments happen,\u201d Stephen K. Wirth, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, said in court.\nThe groups allege that instead of complying with Ali\u2019s directive, the Trump administration \u201cchose to take a series of new actions\u201d around access to a key reimbursement system, adding new approval processes and terminating \u201chundreds of critical personnel\u201d \u2014 \u201call but halting the disbursement of foreign-assistance funds,\u201d according to their emergency motion.\nDespite the State Department <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/28/state-department-foreign-aid-trump-waiver/\">granting a waiver</a> for certain lifesaving aid to resume, the plaintiffs contend, the payment system remains down, with employees seeing a variety of error messages when they try to submit invoices. Many organizations have not been paid for expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2024, before Trump returned to the White House.\nShould the government not comply by Ali\u2019s new deadline, \u201cwe are in uncharted and dangerous territory,\u201d Lauren Bateman, another attorney for the plaintiffs, noted via email after Tuesday\u2019s hearing.\nThe case is among several in which legal experts say the administration has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/20/trump-judge-orders-comply-defy-usaid/\">come close</a> to the red line of disobeying judicial orders as Trump and his allies assert vast<b> </b>presidential powers.\nThousands of federal workers have lost their jobs in recent weeks, adding to the chaos. On Sunday, the administration sent notices that it would <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/\">eliminate</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/\"><b> </b></a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/\">1,600 jobs at USAID</a> and place all but a small number of the remaining employees on leave, after a different federal judge ruled that the job-cutting efforts could move forward.\nAid advocates believe the Trump administration is determined to dismantle USAID, the chief U.S. agency for foreign assistance, which provides $40 billion in help each year.

When Stevens got to his feet, he avoided the scrum as he walked to the scorers\u2019 table to join a developing handshake line.\nWhen he arrived, he had just one question: \u201cWhere\u2019s that trophy at?\u201d\nSaturday\u2019s 55-53 win over Georgetown Prep in Potomac required every ounce of effort Stevens and his Bullis teammates could muster. They were pushed by the talented Little Hoyas (14-13) for the full 32 minutes, but the result granted the Bulldogs (20-7) a continuation of their recent dominance: For the third consecutive season, they claimed the IAC regular season and tournament titles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really special to be a part of something like this,\u201d said Stevens, a senior guard who led his team with 16 points. \u201cBullis has changed my life, so I\u2019m just glad I could be a part of putting three banners up on the wall.\u201d\nAfter trailing 14-3 behind early sharpshooting from Georgetown Prep senior guard Patrick McDonough, the game\u2019s top scorer with 17 points, Bullis had to regroup. The Bulldogs played a rigorous nonconference schedule, at times taking their lumps in the name of preparing for these moments. They contended with injuries and roster turnover, relying on new leaders to prosper and younger pieces to blossom. Each time, the Bulldogs answered the call. A 14-4 run to end the first quarter was Saturday\u2019s answer.\n\u201cThere are times when being a high school basketball coach is the best job in America, and knowing what these boys have been through, just staying together and trusting me, it\u2019s just a great feeling,\u201d Bullis\u2019s Bruce Kelley said.\nFrom the second quarter on, the game felt destined to come down to the final shot \u2014 and it did. Georgetown Prep had possession with eight seconds left, trailing by two. The ball worked its way to five feet beyond the top of the key. The final seconds were ticking off the clock, and the Hoyas\u2019 attempt was on the way to the rim. Kelley could have sworn it was going in.\nBut the shot bounced off the iron, and the game was over. Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d soon blared from the gym\u2019s speakers. The Bulldogs wouldn\u2019t dare tempt the basketball gods by practicing the ritual beforehand, meaning they finally could climb a stepladder to cut down the nets.\n\u201cThat was the greatest feeling I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d freshman Xavier Skipworth said. \u201cCoach always says we have to be a fist and not separate fingers.

The other four girls were arrested Friday, according to police. Their ages were similar to the first two: they were given as 11, 12, 13 and 14.\nThe first indication of a possible motive in the attack was given Friday. It may have been motivated by prejudice, the police said in a statement Friday night.\n\u201cDetectives\u2019 investigation revealed the suspects potentially being motivated by hate or bias,\u201d the statement said.\nAs a result, police said, all six suspects have been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon with an enhancement related to an alleged hate crime.\nThe type of prejudice was not specified. An earlier statement, reporting the first two arrests, said nothing about possible hate or bias or any other motive.\nAuthorities said one of the participants recorded and posted the assault on social media. One of the youths repeatedly kicked and punched the woman, dragged her by the hair \u201cand encouraged the other suspects to continue their attack,\u201d according to a police statement and a report.\nNo serious injuries were reported, police said Friday.\nThe incident occurred Sunday but was not reported to police, who said they learned of it Wednesday when they were alerted to videos on the internet. Police have said they were looking for as many as nine girls in the attack.\n\u201cThe actions of these young suspects are disturbing and deeply disheartening for all of us who care for the youngest people in our community,\u201d D.C Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said in a statement after the first two arrests. \u201cThere is absolutely zero tolerance for this behavior in our city. Harming our community like this will result in your arrest and prosecution, no matter your age.\u201d\nThe attack in Northeast Washington is reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/03/reggie-brown-teen-girls-sentenced-beating-fatal/\" target=\"_blank\">deadly assault</a> in 2023 by five girls ages 12 to 14 on Reginald \u201cReggie\u201d Brown, a frail and disabled 64-year-old man who had been on a stroll that his family said he took to cope with the strain of cancer treatments. One of the girls recorded the beating, and another testified in court that she and her friends had been \u201cbored\u201d and were looking for someone to beat up. All were found criminally responsible in juvenile court and sent to the city\u2019s youth rehabilitation agency.\nThat incident shocked authorities for its brutality and for the ages of its attackers. It occurred during a year in which violent crime soared in the District and when youths, as both victims and offenders, were of high concern.\nIn the attack outside Union Station on Massachusetts Avenue, the assailants assaulted bystanders who tried to intervene, police said. They said the first two girls were charged as juveniles with assault with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to riot, simple assault and disorderly conduct.\nIn addition to the assault charge, those located and arrested Friday were also charged with rioting, the police statement said.\nIn their original statement, police also said they were collaborating with counterparts in other jurisdictions to determine whether the youths could be connected to similar attacks elsewhere. Those other areas were not identified."

Both have sued the Trump administration over their firings, saying their terminations violate federal law, and have been temporarily reinstated by district judges in D.C.\nIn the Feb. 14 complaint, the six workers allege they were fired during \u201cplainly unlawful\u201d mass terminations that were \u201cindisputably conducted with no regard for the performance or conduct of individual probationary employees.\u201d\nThe six employees were terminated around the same time as at least 5,000 or more other probationary workers in their agencies, according to estimates cited in Dellinger\u2019s request. They worked for the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, as well as the Office of Personnel Management.\nDellinger found that the employees had not been given notice of any specific issues with their job performance or conduct before being fired. He concluded that the agencies may have violated federal regulations governing how to reduce a workforce or how to terminate probationary employees.\n\u201cFiring probationary employees without individualized cause appears contrary to a reasonable reading of the law, particularly the provisions establishing rules for reductions in force,\u201d Dellinger said in the Monday statement.\nAlden Law Group partner Michelle Bercovici said in a statement that Tuesday\u2019s decision \u201creflects the importance of the MSPB and OSC in safeguarding the fundamental merit system principles and most importantly, allows these wrongfully terminated employees to return to their jobs, provide for their families, and continue serving the public with dignity and integrity.\u201d"

They also haven\u2019t won at least 50 games in a season \u2014 the mark of a very good but not great team \u2014 since 1978-79.\n\nThe Wizards had been run by Ernie Grunfeld or his top lieutenant, Tommy Sheppard, since 2003. They <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/04/19/wizards-fire-tommy-sheppard/\" target=_blank>broke away from that tree</a> after the 2022-23 season in an organizational overhaul.\nWashington <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/05/24/michael-winger-wizards-general-manager/\" target=_blank>hired former Los Angeles Clippers general manager Michael Winger</a> as the president of Monumental Basketball, the group overseeing the Wizards, the WNBA\u2019s Washington Mystics and the G League\u2019s Capital City Go-Go. Winger <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/06/05/will-dawkins-wizards-general-manager/\" target=_blank>brought in General Manager Will Dawkins</a>, who previously worked with Winger with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nWeeks after the two were hired, they began an intense rebuild that included trading stars Bradley Beal and Kristaps Porzingis.\nAn oversimplified description of Washington\u2019s new strategy: Lose a lot, get high draft picks, accumulate young talent, and develop it into a winning core.\nThe Wizards won just 15 games in 2023-24. They\u2019re on pace for even fewer this season and have often lost by wide margins. Until recently, they were en route to having the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/01/30/wizards-lakers-lebron-james/\" target=_blank>worst average point differential</a> in NBA history.\nA recent positive stretch (more on that later) has bumped them up to third worst.\n\nWinger and Dawkins have overseen two drafts in D.C. They have made four first-round picks, including <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/26/wizards-deni-avdija-trade-trail-blazers/\" target=_blank>three last year</a>, and acquired another rookie this month <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/05/kyle-kuzma-trade-khris-middleton/\" target=_blank>in the Kyle Kuzma trade</a>.\nThe Wizards haven\u2019t been shy about playing their youth, believing in-game repetitions \u2014 going through the fire, as Coach Brian Keefe often puts it \u2014 is the best way to develop. Injuries to Kuzma and guard Malcolm Brogdon early this season increased the young players\u2019 minutes and roles.\n\nThe development process often has been ugly \u2014 as evidenced by two 16-game losing streaks, each tying the franchise record.\nWashington almost always has multiple players on the court who have yet to reach their physical primes or maximize their skills \u2014 players who are often committing youthful mistakes and undergoing growing pains. The Wizards have the NBA\u2019s worst offensive and defensive ratings (points scored and allowed per 100 possessions), per Basketball Reference.\nThose young players seem to be improving, an increased comfort somewhat evident in the Wizards\u2019 recent positive stretch. In February, the team jumped to 11th in offensive rating and 21st in defensive rating, per analytics site Cleaning the Glass. The month even featured a season-best three-game winning streak.\n\nBut Wizards fans probably don\u2019t want to see their team win <i>too much</i> over the final 28 games. Though the NBA flattened the lottery odds so the three worst teams have the same chance at netting the No. 1 draft pick, finishing worst means that team can fall only as far as fifth.\n\nThis season undoubtedly has been painful, evident in the red on all of these graphs. Winger, Dawkins and the rest of the organization hope the short-term struggles lead to a high draft pick and eventually the type of sustainable winner that has been absent in Washington for nearly 50 years."

        "content": "The Trump administration has removed the top official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement one month into his tenure, as White House officials have become <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/ice-arrests-immigration-deportations/\" target=_blank>increasingly frustrated</a> that the agency isn\u2019t arresting immigrants fast enough to satisfy the president\u2019s deportation goals.\nCaleb Vitello, a veteran ICE official who was installed as acting director when President Donald Trump took office, will be reassigned to a senior role overseeing daily enforcement operations, according to Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. She did not say who would replace him.\nTrump has ordered ICE to carry out the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/interactive/2025/trump-immigrants-mass-deportations/?itid=ap_nickmiroff_9\" target=_blank>largest mass deportation campaign</a> in U.S. history and quickly ramp up the number of immigrants it arrests each day. Despite the administration dedicating a rush of resources to the effort that has included sending thousands of troops to the southern border and assigning thousands of agents and officers from the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies, ICE\u2019s budget and staffing remain largely unchanged, leaving officers scrambling to meet aggressive arrest quotas.\nIn late January, Vitello told ICE\u2019s 25 field office directors they should arrest at least 75 immigrants per day for a national <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/26/ice-arrests-raids-trump-quota/\" target=_blank>daily total of 1,200 to 1,500</a>. ICE officers have been working six and even seven days a week since then, but Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem and Trump \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan have blamed agency officials for falling far short of those goals. Homan did not respond to requests for comment.\nLouisiana Secretary of Wildlife and Fisheries<b> </b>Madison Sheahan, a former campaign aide to Noem, is expected to become acting deputy director of ICE, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a position that hadn\u2019t been publicly announced. Sheahan was also <a href=\"https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2023/01/19/sheahan-named-executive-director-sd-gop/\" target=_blank>executive director</a> of the South Dakota GOP. A DHS official said that \u201cpositions are being reevaluated\u201d and that the agency had \u201cnothing new to announce at this time.\u201d\nICE averaged more than 800 arrests per day nationwide in late January in the 10 days after Trump took office, publishing its results on social media amid a publicity campaign that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/28/new-york-city-ice-raid/\" target=_blank>invited television crews</a> to embed with officers. The pace of arrests slowed during the first two weeks of February to fewer than 600 daily, and ICE stopped publishing data on social media, saying it would move to a monthly format.\nCurrent and former ICE officials said the enforcement blitz in late January depleted the lists of targets ICE developed before Trump took office with the names, addresses and other data on immigrants they could arrest. Officer teams have not had time to build out new target lists.\nOfficers have also struggled to meet their quotas because many immigrants are refusing to open their doors when ICE officers knock, according to three ICE officials. Noem has accused FBI agents of leaking sensitive information about upcoming immigration enforcement operations, which the law enforcement agency has pushed back on.<b> </b>The enforcement teams generally do not possess criminal arrest warrants that would allow them to force their way into their targets\u2019 residences. ICE officials say they can\u2019t afford to leave teams of officers waiting for targeted immigrants to leave their homes.\nVitello\u2019s demotion follows the reassignment this month of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/11/ice-enforcement-officials-reassigned/\" target=_blank>top two officials at ICE\u2019s enforcement division</a>.\nA Trump administration official said that Vitello will now oversee field and enforcement operations as part of an effort to expand the team. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the personnel move, said Noem made the decision and it was not done at Trump\u2019s direction.\nVitello\u2019s removal was first reported Friday by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ice-leadership-changes-trump-deportations-1856e1bb\" target=_blank>The Wall Street Journal</a>. Several ICE staffers said news of his demotion caught them by surprise, and they found out through news alerts.\nJason Houser, chief of staff for ICE under President Joe Biden, said that the White House is asking ICE to \u201cdefy the math\u201d and do things that are \u201cunrealistic.\u201d\n\u201cThe White House needs to look in the mirror,\u201d Houser said. \u201cThe dysfunction isn\u2019t with ICE rank-and-file who are trying to do their jobs effectively.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has sought to take an<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/ice-arrests-immigration-deportations/\" target=_blank> all-of-government approach </a>to immigration enforcement, treating it as a near wartime effort. At least 3,600 servicemen and servicewomen have been sent to the border, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/15/border-soldiers-texas-migrants-trump/\" target=_blank>according to the </a>Defense Department. The administration has used military planes to transport migrants to locations as far away as India. As ICE has run out of space in its detention centers, the Trump administration has started to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/16/trump-guantanamo-migrants-deportations-venezuela/\" target=_blank>send migrants to the Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base in Cuba</a>, where Trump ordered the construction of a detention camp with 30,000 beds. On Thursday, 177 Venezuelan migrants  at Guant\u00e1namo were <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/20/guantanamo-migrants-trump-deportations-honduras/\" target=_blank>deported</a> to their homeland.\nHoman has said he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with the results so far. Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) said recently that Homan came to the Hill \u201cbegging\u201d for additional money. The Senate adopted a budget blueprint early Friday  for legislation to increase border security and immigration enforcement by $175 billion. Trump has backed a competing, more expansive plan in the House.\nThe Biden administration deported 271,000 people in fiscal year 2024, the highest annual total in a decade. Deportations during Trump\u2019s first term reached a peak of about 267,000 during the 2019 fiscal year, even as he made similar promises. ICE would need to deport more than 2,700 people a day to hit 1 million deportations a year, a goal that veteran immigration officials say is improbable."

        "headline": "Judge allows intelligence agencies to fire officers in DEI roles",
        "content": "A federal judge on Thursday refused to stop the CIA and director of national intelligence from firing 51 officers who had been assigned to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility roles that were scrapped last month by President Donald Trump. The officers may not appeal to civil service boards, and they may not transfer to other jobs in the intelligence community because agency rules allow the director to fire employees without any recourse.\nIn three court hearings this month, U.S. District Judge Anthony J. Trenga questioned why the Trump administration decided to fire all of the officials instead of reassigning them, as had been recommended by career-services officials at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\u201cThese are talented, experienced assets, if you will, that would be in the interests of the United States to be reassigned elsewhere, if that need existed,\u201d Trenga said at a hearing Monday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.\nBut government lawyers said CIA Director John Ratcliffe relied on a regulation particular to the intelligence community stating that \u201cany employee may be terminated from the Agency at any time without regard to any procedural steps \u2026 when the [director], in his discretion, deems it necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States.\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Dennis Barghaan said that prevented the employees from being reassigned.\nKevin T. Carroll, a lawyer for the fired officers, argued that \u201cin the interest of the United States\u201d meant that the employee was being fired for reasons related to national security, and that there should be individualized findings before anyone is released. But Trenga said the court didn\u2019t have jurisdiction over an administrative claim unless the agency waived its sovereign immunity, and that the officers probably wouldn\u2019t prevail on the issues that their First Amendment right to free speech and their Fifth Amendment right to due process were violated.\n\u201cIn effect, they are at-will employees,\u201d the judge ruled. \u201cThe regulations make it clear they have no property interest in the employment they have.\u201d\nAs the disappointed officers looked on, Carroll said afterward: \u201cWe respect the court\u2019s decision. I would certainly hope, given the judge\u2019s remarks, that Director Ratcliffe would consider allowing the plaintiffs to apply for other jobs.\u201d He said one of the fired officers had eight other job offers within the CIA, as a data scientist, but was prevented from accepting one.\nThe lawsuit was filed by 19 anonymous intelligence officers who said they had been temporarily assigned to DEI roles within their agencies and were now being scapegoated \u201cin the service of a partisan ideological agenda.\u201d Some of the employees have been on the job for two decades, according to court records. Ten of the employees were in court for Thursday\u2019s ruling, but declined to comment afterward.\nEarlier, Carroll said the career intelligence officers had been trained at taxpayers\u2019 expense to perform some of the most sensitive spy jobs \u2014 \u201cfrom source development to recruitment\u201d and \u201ccollection to analysis\u201d \u2014 and that they were being fired despite being qualified for other open positions at their agencies. Some stand to lose the government pensions they had been working toward for years, the lawyer said.\n\u201cNone of these officers\u2019 activities was or is illegal, and at no time have the agencies employing Plaintiffs contended that they individually engaged in any misconduct, nor are they accused of poor performance,\u201d Carroll said in a legal filing. Their job duties included \u201cadvancing the hiring, promotion and advancement of members of protected classes,\u201d and firing them for performing assigned work would violate their constitutional rights, he said.\nAccording to court records, the officers were placed on administrative leave with pay two days after Trump signed an executive order last month terminating all DEI programs in the executive branch. Weeks later, some of the officers were told to report to their agencies\u2019 visitor centers with their badges and without lawyers. That\u2019s what it looks like when an intelligence community member is about to get fired or placed on leave without pay, one of the anonymous CIA officers said in a court filing.\nThe intelligence officer defended the need for diversity among the agency\u2019s ranks. Blending in \u201cracially and culturally\u201d among foreign populations is key to intelligence collection, he said. \u201cThere are needs for dual citizenship documentation, foreign language skills and/or overseas living experiences,\u201d the officer said, noting that in some cultural settings, women will not meet alone with men.\nJustice Department attorneys said in a legal filing that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard had not finalized any plans to fire officers in DEI roles. But Gabbard and Ratcliffe have unqualified authority to fire any of their employees, and Ratcliffe has chosen to use it, the attorneys argued.\nRatcliffe in a court filing said he could terminate any CIA employee under provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, \u201cwhen, in my discretion, I deem it \u2018necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.\u2019 \u201d Shutting down the CIA\u2019s diversity and inclusion office and firing all its employees met that standard, he said.\nThe DEI-related firings could affect not just the 19 intelligence officers who sued but a total of 51 employees at the CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence, their attorneys said. At the CIA, they said, the mass ouster \u201csuggests an unlawful effort \u2026 to misuse the Director\u2019s unique national security-related authorities to evade federal equal opportunity laws.\u201d\nTrenga said he was puzzled by the CIA\u2019s decision not to reassign the officers. Agency regulations state that any employees who are terminated as part of a downsizing should be offered open positions, he said. Justice Department attorneys said Ratcliffe fired the employees under a different regulation that provides no such job protections.\n\u201cI frankly don\u2019t quite understand why that\u2019s being resisted by the agency,\u201d the judge said at the hearing Monday. Trenga was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush and presides over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in addition to serving as a federal district court judge in Virginia.\nAttorneys for the CIA officers said the agency\u2019s career service has identified at least one suitable open position for each of them."

        "content": "A federal judge on Wednesday extended for three days an order preventing the Trump administration from firing the head of an independent watchdog agency that has sought to pause President Donald Trump\u2019s mass termination of some probationary federal workers.\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she wanted more time to consider the lawyers\u2019 arguments before issuing a broader ruling on whether the administration\u2019s attempted ouster of Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, was unlawful. A temporary restraining order barring Dellinger\u2019s firing will remain in place until Saturday, she said.\nDellinger, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sued the administration after he received a one-sentence email earlier this month telling him he was fired from the office, which protects government whistleblowers. He said his termination violated a law that says the president can remove him only for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\u201d Jackson on Feb. 12 ordered him reinstated for two weeks while his case proceeds.\nThe Trump administration argues that the Constitution allows Trump to remove Dellinger and other agency leaders.\nOn Tuesday, an independent federal board <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/probationary-employee-firings-trump-musk-doge/\" target=\"_blank\">granted a request</a> by Dellinger to halt the administration\u2019s firings of six probationary government employees.

Unlike other agency heads, the special counsel was granted independence from the president to investigate potential wrongdoing by the administration, the judge said. Dellinger was appointed to a five-year term that ends in 2029.\n\u201cHis actual job is to be a check and balance on the president,\u201d Jackson said.\nThe judge pressed Justice Department lawyer Madeline McMahon to explain why it would be in the public interest to fire Dellinger.\nMcMahon said barring Dellinger\u2019s removal would cause Trump to \u201close control over an executive branch agency\u201d and would represent an \u201cintrusion\u201d into Trump\u2019s authority under the Constitution."

        "content": "<a href=\"https://www.dcunited.com/\" target=_blank>D.C. United</a> spent the offseason acquiring more than a dozen players, accounting for about half the roster. The goalkeeping corps is new. An Aussie center back arrived from Scotland, a Brazilian winger via Poland. Five newcomers are expected to start Saturday night\u2019s opener against Toronto FC at Audi Field.\nWhy, then, does it feel as if United did not accomplish much this winter?\nPerhaps because, unlike many teams around MLS, United did not make any blockbuster trades or sign a high-priced international player. Instead, it acquired three players who missed most of last season with injuries and four who toiled most, if not all, of 2024 in the second division. Two other acquisitions were MLS backups. Three came from overseas with modest fanfare, another through the college draft.\n\u201cFor those that have that perception, that\u2019s understandable,\u201d United Coach Troy Lesesne said of the restrained activity. \u201cWe\u2019ve signed some players that may not carry that type of [big] name but are very talented themselves. They fit our game model, and we believe in them, and we hope that D.C. United is going to be a platform for them to take off in their career.\u201d\nUnited has one of MLS\u2019s biggest names: captain <a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/players/christian-benteke/\" target=_blank>Christian Benteke</a>, MLS\u2019s scoring champion. He is D.C.\u2019s only designated player \u2014 the label for talent that exceeds salary cap restrictions and requires ownership to pay mostly out of pocket. Each team is allowed to employ up to three DPs.\nUnited\u2019s second slot remains filled by team assists leader Mateusz Klich, even though he is no longer on the roster. Though he was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/19/dc-united-mateusz-klich-trade/\" target=_blank>traded to Atlanta</a>, most of his contract remains on United\u2019s books.\nAlthough Lesesne and his players are upbeat, United failed to generate any offseason buzz in MLS circles. Accordingly, <a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/ranking-all-30-mls-teams-by-tier-for-2025\" target=\"_blank\">preseason predictions</a> have D.C. missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive year and finishing at or near the bottom of the 15-team Eastern Conference.\n\u201cYou want to be the team that\u2019s looked at as the big dogs in the league. You want to be one of the favorites and have that privilege of having the target on your back,\u201d all-star right back Aaron Herrera said. \u201cBut at the same time, we\u2019re realistic with ourselves. We saw what we did last year and where we ended up. So how do we expect to be [higher in] anyone\u2019s prediction? We\u2019re here to prove people wrong.\u201d\nSince Lesense and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/28/ally-mackay-dc-united-new-gm/\" target=_blank>General Manager Ally Mackay</a> took over before the 2024 season, the roster has been gutted. Benteke and injured midfielder Jackson Hopkins are the only players remaining from the 2023 opener.\nThis year\u2019s squad features not only 13 newcomers but four holdovers who either arrived deep into last season or missed most of the year with injury.\nReturning center back Lucas Bartlett has a new partner: Australia\u2019s Kye Rowles, a 2022 World Cup starter who played the past 2\u00bd years for Hearts in Scotland. The new starting goalkeeper is Kim Joon Hong, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/13/kim-joon-hong-dc-united/\" target=\"_blank\">a 21-year-old South Korean</a>.\nHosei Kijima, a rookie midfielder for St. Louis City last year, drew rave reviews from teammates in the preseason. Costa Rican Randall Leal (Nashville) and Brazilian <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/16/dc-united-signs-joao-peglow/\" target=_blank>Jo\u00e3o Peglow</a> (Polish league) also hope to bolster the attack. Brazilian playmaker <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/gabriel-pirani-brazil-united/\" target=_blank>Gabriel Pirani</a>, in his second full season in Washington, is aiming for a breakout year after showing bright signs late last season.\nLesesne will also need players to show improvement after mixed performances last year.\n\u201cWhen I look at myself, I\u2019m not saying I wasted a year, but as a young player, every year you want to take big steps forward,\u201d said Matti Peltola, a 22-year-old midfielder. \u201cIf I\u2019m not going to be able to take big steps forward this year, then I\u2019m really looking [in] the mirror, big time.\u201d\nWith some roster space and cap flexibility, United could continue to make changes until the initial roster deadline April 23. The summer transfer window, which opens in July, typically offers an abundant international marketplace.\n\u201cWe created a good group,\u201d Benteke said. \u201cEven though I\u2019m the captain [and] I\u2019m the leader, I believe the star of the team is going to be the group because the way we want to play, we will need all of us.\u201d\nLesesne has retained a high-pressure style designed to force turnovers and create immediate opportunities. In the preseason, he implemented a plan that also won\u2019t rely as heavily on Benteke (23 goals) and will generate a wider variety of chances.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in constant evolution and improvement,\u201d Lesesne said. \u201cIf you watched us in preseason, you could see, \u2018Okay, they\u2019re trying to go for something a little bit different.\u2019\u201d\nDefensively, United will need to tighten up not only in its own end but in transition. Last year, teams often unlocked D.C.\u2019s press and capitalized on open space. United conceded 70 goals, third most in MLS and second most in club history.\n\u201cThe intensity of the press is still going to be the same,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a couple different pieces, couple different moving parts.\u201d\nUnited will also need to improve its home performance after ending 2024 in a 1-6-5 rut at Audi Field and 4-8-5 overall. The team will play three of its first four matches at Buzzard Point, and none of those four opponents had a winning record last year.\nWhile championship aspirations seem far-fetched, Lesesne and the players say they see promise after <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/10/19/dc-united-misses-playoffs-charlotte-fc/\" target=_blank>narrowly missing the playoffs </a>last fall.\n(The front office also sees promise: To entice former season ticket holders to return, United promised a 30 percent rebate if the team fails to make the playoffs.)\n\u201cWe were competitive last year, and we started to show ourselves in terms of the proof of concept was there,\u201d Lesesne said. \u201cWe want to build on that, but we have to take a bigger step this year. I don\u2019t want to be around this position of nine, 10, 11 [in the standings] and just be in the mix. I\u2019d like us to take a step forward.\u201d\nD.C. United roster"

        "headline": "Layoffs to hit IRS as DOGE targets tax collections",
        "content": "The Trump administration is expected to begin laying off thousands of employees at the Internal Revenue Service, six people briefed on the matter said, as billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s team begins to target tax collections.\nTreasury officials have discussed laying off roughly 9,000 employees still in their probationary period as part of broader dismissals across the government of recently hired workers, according to the six people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal conversations. That number could not be immediately confirmed, and spokespeople both for the IRS and Treasury declined to comment. The cuts could start as soon as Friday.\nThe layoffs are likely targeting tax collection, several of the people briefed on the matter said. Indeed, associates of Musk\u2019s team are beginning to meet with high-ranking IRS officials about what could prove dramatic changes to the tax agency. Gavin Kliger, a software engineer now working at the IRS, met with Ken Corbin, the IRS\u2019s chief of taxpayer services, and Heather Maloy, the agency\u2019s top enforcement official, during his first day at the agency\u2019s headquarters Thursday, according to several of the people familiar with the meetings.\nRepublicans have long aimed to shrink the tax agency and were particularly incensed by the Biden administration\u2019s push to hire thousands of new IRS agents to increase tax enforcement and collections. The cuts to federal personnel are likely to weaken the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to bolster the IRS, though to what extent remains uncertain.\nThe tax agency grew by about 10 percent last year, as its ranks swelled from roughly 90,000 employees in fiscal year 2023 to 100,000 employees this fiscal year. The IRS has said publicly that personnel critical to the tax filing season are ineligible for the \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d plan that encouraged federal personnel to quit. That has fueled speculation that the cuts to IRS personnel will be concentrated among the agency\u2019s tax collection staff, which could reduce the amount of revenue brought into federal coffers even as Musk calls for a reduced deficit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite distressing, because the Biden administration made serious efforts to bolster enforcement. I think all of that is in jeopardy now,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, who served as a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. \u201cStripping the IRS of resources is a windfall for those who like to game the system, and those are the most sophisticated and richest taxpayers.\u201d\nCongressional Republicans are likely to welcome DOGE\u2019s changes to the IRS. On Thursday, Rep. Jason T. Smith (R-Missouri), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, wrote a letter to IRS\u2019s acting commissioner blasting the $80 billion funding increase for the tax agency, among other measures.\n\u201cPresident Trump has shown in his first three weeks that he meant what he said during the presidential campaign. Our government has not been working effectively for the American people, and it needs to change,\u201d Smith\u2019s letter states.\nCongress had given <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/06/inflation-reduction-act-irs/\" target=\"_blank\">the IRS $80 billion</a> over 10 years through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, but<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/26/irs-funding-cut-20-billion-shutdown/\" target=\"_blank\"> Congress rescinded $20 billion</a> of that.\nWithin the agency, the impending job cuts are being met with dread, both for individuals and the health of the tax system. The vast majority of Treasury employees work for the IRS.\nIRS employees cheered the Biden administration\u2019s funding boosts, which yielded almost immediate performance and IT improvements. Now rolling those back \u2014 and cutting thousands of freshly hired employees \u2014 could send the agency into a tailspin in the middle of filing season.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like going off a cliff immediately,\u201d said David Carrone, a revenue agent and president of the Louisiana-Arkansas National Treasury Employees Union chapter.\n<i>Isaac Arnsdorf contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "The Pentagon said Friday that it will fire about 5,400 civilian employees beginning next week in an \u201cinitial\u201d purge of its workforce, as President Donald Trump\u2019s hastily issued orders to shake up the Defense Department faced new scrutiny and officials scrambled to understand whether such actions could imperil national security.\nThe announcement followed a day of uncertainty, as administration officials paused a plan to begin firings now while evaluating requests to retain thousands of other employees deemed essential. A senior Pentagon official, Darin Selnick, said in a statement late Friday that the Trump administration intends to cull its workforce by between 5 and 8 percent. With more than 900,000 civilian employees in the Defense Department, tens of thousands of people could be forced out eventually.\nEchoing <a href=\"https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1892702578418327972\" target=_blank>a pronouncement</a> made earlier by Trump\u2019s defense secretary,<b> </b>Pete Hegseth, Selnick said in his statement that \u201cit is simply not in the public interest to retain individuals whose contributions are not mission-critical.\u201d\n\u201cTaxpayers deserve to have us take a thorough look at our workforce top-to-bottom to see where we can eliminate redundancies,\u201d Selnick added. The cuts are necessary, he said, \u201cto produce efficiencies and refocus\u201d the Pentagon on Trump\u2019s national security priorities.\nThe firings are not expected to target U.S. troops. The Pentagon oversees about 1.3 million active-duty service members and nearly 800,000 more who are in the National Guard and reserves.\nThe cuts will come after Trump administration officials, coordinating with billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s U.S. DOGE Service, have slashed thousands of employees elsewhere in the government as part of the president\u2019s broad effort to dismantle the federal bureaucracy.\nThe Defense Department\u2019s civilian worker purge is beginning with probationary employees, those who have one to three years of experience or who recently were promoted, according to officials familiar with the matter, who like some others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue\u2019s sensitivity. That pool of people numbers between 50,000 and 55,000, officials said.\nAfter deliberations over the last day, the Pentagon has settled on firing about 10 percent of its probational employees, a defense official familiar with the effort said. A hiring freeze is expected to take hold next week, and administration officials plan to spend two to three months analyzing who else could be ousted, the official said.\nSupervisors throughout the department, the federal government\u2019s largest, have spent days requesting of the new administration that certain employees should be spared because the work they do is vital to national defense. An email obtained by The Washington Post indicates that Trump officials ultimately decided they need more time to sort through those many cases.\nThe message, sent Thursday night by Ruth Vetter, a lawyer in the Pentagon general counsel\u2019s office, said that senior officials had informed human resources staff that \u201cthey should not initiate removals of probationary employees\u201d on Friday because requests for exemptions citing mission criticality \u201care still under review.\u201d\nVetter\u2019s email, labeled \u201cPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL,\u201d warned that an employee\u2019s past performance \u201cmust be viewed through the current needs and best interest of the government, in light of the President\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\u201d\nVetter referred questions to Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot, who did not respond to requests for comment.\nAmong the agency\u2019s probationary employees are hundreds of teachers who work for the Department of Defense Education Activity, a school system that educates about 67,000 students \u2014 mostly the children of service members \u2014 at military installations around the globe. One person familiar with the matter said that DoDEA officials were attempting to save teachers from Trump\u2019s purge of the federal workforce, but it was unclear if the effort would be successful. A DoDEA spokesman declined to comment.\nAt the Office of Naval Intelligence, which provides senior military officials with maritime threat assessments and related analysis, employees were called to a meeting Thursday at their headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, where they were told that all probationary workers would be terminated, said one intelligence analyst.\nThe analyst went to work Friday expecting to be out of a job, but was informed that no further instructions had been received. \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up too much,\u201d he said he was told.\nThe analyst, an Air Force veteran, said about 60 people in his office could be fired, and voiced frustration that he and his colleagues are seen by DOGE officials as numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\u201cWork is next to impossible right now,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cMorale is through the floor.\u201d\nCoinciding with the civilian-worker purge, U.S. defense officials, acting on orders from Hegseth, have undertaken a sprawling effort to compile options for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/19/trump-pentagon-budget-cuts/\" target=_blank>slashing about 8 percent</a> from each armed service\u2019s budget for each of the next five years. Doing so, Hegseth has said, could yield $50 billion in 2026 to be reinvested elsewhere in the Defense Department, including an expensive missile-defense shield that Trump has taken to calling \u201cIron Dome For America.\u201d\nAfter news of Hegseth\u2019s directive alarmed lawmakers and defense officials, the former Fox News personality sought to blame the news media for causing confusion about the administration\u2019s efforts and portrayed his plan as a \u201creorienting\u201d of the Pentagon budget away from \u201cwoke, Biden-era nonlethal programs\u201d to \u201cinstead spend that money on President Trump\u2019s America First, peace-through-strength priorities for our national budget.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a cut,\u201d Hegseth said in a nearly <a href=\"https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1892702578418327972\" target=_blank>nine-minute video</a> posted to social media on Thursday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s refocusing and reinvesting existing funds into building a force to protect you, the American people.\u201d\nBut independent budget analysts said it is highly unlikely that tens of billions of dollars per year can be targeted for reinvestment without slashing some major weapons programs and cutting the number troops in some of the services.\nTravis Sharp, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the fiscal 2025 budget under President Joe Biden included $162 million for diversity, equity and inclusion programs and $3.6 billion to build resiliency at Defense Department installations to counter climate change. Even if all of that money is removed from the budget and reprogrammed, he said, it\u2019s a \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d at getting to $50 billion.\nTo achieve such an ambitious goal, Sharp said, the Pentagon could retire older weapons programs, eliminate newer ones that remain in development, and shrink or shutter individual headquarters and agencies. Similar efforts have been undertaken before, Sharp said, including by Defense Secretary Robert Gates under President Barack Obama, but they still fell well short of Hegseth\u2019s goals.\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re attempting is unprecedented in recent history,\u201d Sharp said.\nMackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said it will take an \u201call of the above\u201d approach to cut that deeply into existing defense budget to fund new efforts. She noted that in a memo to senior Pentagon officials on Tuesday, Hegseth \u201cwalled off\u201d 17 key priorities identified by the Trump administration \u2014 including missile defense, submarines, one-way attack drones and border security. So other areas will be especially vulnerable.\n\u201cLook, the Defense Department reflects America,\u201d she said. \u201cThe largest line item on the balance sheet of most corporations is labor. It\u2019s people. There\u2019s no workforce you can spare. They\u2019re going to have to go after the defense civilian workforce as well as active-duty military end strength.\u201d\nAnother option the Trump administration could pursue, especially if it seeks to slash billions of dollars in future years for new priorities, is the closure of some existing military bases, Eaglen said. Such efforts \u2014 commonly known as base realignment and closure \u2014 have been politically unpopular, but could be appealing to Musk, she predicted.\n\u201cThere is a very compelling case for base closure,\u201d Eaglen said. \u201cIf you kind of get into those weeds with people, you can make a rational business case. I actually think Congress could be compelled with a bully [defense secretary] and bully White House.\u201d\n<i>Warren P. Strobel contributed to this report.</i>"

The union says such access poses security risks.\nIn addition to the AFT, the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They are joined by six individuals with sensitive data stored in federal systems, including military veterans who received federal student loans.\nThe Education Department collects personal information to administer federal financial aid programs. DOGE had gained access to the department\u2019s databases, including Federal Student Aid Partner Connect, the Financial Management System and the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/trump-presidency-news/#link-AFIQUVHY3BF4VHB5UF7HS57W4E\" target=_blank>National Student Loan Data System</a>.\nDOGE, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/\">previous Washington Post reporting</a>, has been<b> </b>feeding data from across the Education Department into artificial intelligence software to probe the agency\u2019s programs and spending. The effort is part of a push to slash spending and shrink the agency\u2019s staff, as President Donald Trump seeks to dismantle the<b> </b>department.\nIn the 33-page ruling, Boardman wrote that the government \u201cnever explains why\u201d OPM and department personnel need this widespread access to Americans\u2019 private information<b> </b>to carry out the overhaul.\nBoardman released the order days after a federal judge in a separate lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/18/court-declines-stop-doge-accessing-student-data/\">refused</a> to issue a restraining order to stop Musk\u2019s team from accessing student data at the Education Department, saying<b> </b>there was no immediate threat in allowing it."

Officers witnessed the exchange, which they said in a statement occurred as Tarrio was walking near Delaware Avenue NE and D Street NE.\n\u201cThe woman told our officers that she wanted to be a complainant, and the man was arrested for the simple assault,\u201d Capitol Police spokesman Tim Barber said in<b> </b>the statement.\nIn response to a request for comment, Tarrio wrote in a text message: \u201cI have no problem with people screaming or bullhorn if us but the moment you put your hands on me...which she did...I\u2019m reacting.

Tarrio pleaded guilty to destruction of property along with attempted possession of a high-capacity ammunition magazine found in his luggage when he was arrested after arriving in Washington for Trump\u2019s Jan. 6, 2021, demonstration.\nTarrio said in an interview earlier this week that he returned to Washington to reunite with other Proud Boys in town for the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.\nDuring the news conference, a few protesters brought a noise machine and megaphone to heckle the speakers, calling them \u201cNazis\u201d and \u201cterrorists,\u201d while Tarrio, Rhodes and other Proud Boys repeated a revisionist history of the attack that cast themselves as persecuted patriots. Capitol Police kept the two groups apart, and there did not appear to be any physical confrontations at that time.\nThe small crowd of Proud Boys and others involved in the Jan. 6 attack then walked around the outside of the U.S. Capitol, taking selfies, group photos and at one point erupting in chants of \u201cWe won!\u201d\nShortly after, Tarrio was arrested as live-streamers and journalists recorded police escorting him away.\n<i>Spencer S.

        "headline": "Trump administration seeks more power to fire independent regulators",
        "content": "The Trump administration has told Congress it is prepared to disavow a long-standing Supreme Court ruling that has preserved the independence of certain government agencies and protected commissioners from being fired without good reason.\nThe notice to lawmakers this week is another signal that the new president intends to make it easier to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/13/trump-firings-watchdogs/\" target=_blank>purge federal government workers</a> and exert maximum control over the bureaucracy. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has fired government agency watchdogs and officials who protect whistleblowers, in addition to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/28/trump-fire-eeoc-nlrb-board-members/\" target=_blank>members of the boards of<b> </b>three independent federal agencies</a> that oversee swaths of U.S. workers, employers and labor unions.\nThe board terminations appear to violate laws that protect certain agency leaders from being fired by the president<b> </b>without cause, potentially setting up a test of the boundaries of presidential power before the Supreme Court.\nIn a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) on Wednesday, the administration outlined its legal defense of the commissioner firings and appeared to be counting on a conservative Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/supreme-court-donald-trump-test-cases-presidential-authority/\" target=_blank>to be receptive to the president\u2019s expansive views</a> of executive authority.\n\u201cThe Department of Justice has determined that certain for-cause removal provisions that apply to members of multimember regulatory commissions are unconstitutional and that the Department will no longer defend their constitutionality,\u201d acting solicitor general Sarah M. Harris wrote.\nSuch letters are<b> </b>required by Congress when the administration has decided not to defend a federal statute. It essentially put lawmakers<b> </b>on notice that<b> </b>the administration<b> </b>is willing to urge the justices to overturn the 1935 Supreme Court ruling in <i>Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. U.S.</i>, which has protected members of regulatory agencies<b> </b>such as the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe Constitution gives the president the power to remove top executive branch officials for any reason at all, but Congress passed legislation that said those officials may not be fired without cause, an attempt to ensure their independence. The Trump administration\u2019s position would give the president more control over those agencies and essentially treat their leaders more like Cabinet secretaries.\nIn response, Durbin said members of independent, bipartisan agencies such as the NLRB and FTC, which safeguard consumers and workers, have long been protected from removal at the whim of the president. The Trump administration\u2019s push to overturn a nearly century-old Supreme Court precedent, he said in a statement, is a \u201cstriking reversal of the Justice Department\u2019s long-standing position under Republican and Democratic presidents alike.\u201d\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move drew praise from conservatives such as Ed Whelan, a commentator and distinguished senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. He<b> </b>wrote in his newsletter Thursday that the administration is \u201crejecting \u2014 soundly, in my view \u2014 the notion that Congress may limit the president\u2019s ability to remove principal officers of executive-branch agencies.\u201d\nBut Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor and co-director of the school\u2019s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, said the administration\u2019s position amounted to a power grab with Trump wanting<b> </b>\u201cto get rid of anyone who is not in his thrall.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to turn the entire federal government into an episode of \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 where he screams \u2018You\u2019re fired\u2019 at everybody,\u201d she said, making a reference to the president\u2019s former<b> </b>reality TV show.\nIn late January, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/05/trump-lawsuit-nlrb-board-members-firing/\" target=_blank>Trump fired Gwynne Wilcox</a>, a Biden nominee on the NLRB whose term was set to expire in 2028. Wilcox filed a lawsuit alleging that her dismissal defied \u201cSupreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies.\u201d\nThe suit says that while Wilcox \u201chas no desire to aid the President in establishing a test case,\u201d she is also aware \u201cof the fact that, if no challenge is made, the President will have effectively succeeded in rendering\u201d invalid \u201cthe NLRB\u2019s protections \u2014 and, by extension, that of other independent agencies.\u201d\nThe NLRB \u2014 which oversees unionization votes by workers and adjudicates allegations of labor law violations \u2014 has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/21/musk-trump-nlrb-amazon-spacex/\" target=_blank>faced a flurry of legal challenges</a> to its constitutionality over the past year, including by SpaceX and Amazon (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post). Workers are already being affected by Wilcox\u2019s firing, including a group of Philadelphia Whole Foods employees who voted to unionize the same day she was removed.\nWhole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, objected to the union\u2019s win on the grounds that, without Wilcox, the National Labor Relations Board lacks a quorum and therefore doesn\u2019t have the authority to certify the election result. Legal experts said the argument is invalid.\nIn <i>Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. U.S.</i>, the Supreme Court said Congress could stop the president from firing without good reason a member of the Federal Trade Commission. Specifically, the high court said President Franklin D. Roosevelt could not remove one of the FTC commissioners because of their political differences.\nEver since the Reagan administration, the conservative legal movement has advocated a robust view of presidential power known as the \u201cunitary executive theory\u201d in which the president controls all executive decisions without restraint from Congress. The theory played a role in 2020, when the court ruled 5-4 that the structure of another independent watchdog agency was unconstitutional and that the president could fire without cause the director of the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-7_n6io.pdf\" target=_blank>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>.\nThat decision did not overrule the directive in <i>Humphrey\u2019s Executor </i>that Congress can restrict the president\u2019s power to fire officials at \u201cmultimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power.\u201d\nBut Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote separately to call for the ruling to be overturned, saying the precedent<b> </b>\u201cposes a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people.\u201d\nIt is not clear<b> </b>how many of the<b> </b>other justices would agree with Thomas and Gorsuch if given the opportunity in a future case.<b> </b>The court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority, with three justices nominated by Trump, last year overturned<b> </b>another long-standing ruling targeted by conservatives<b> </b>that required judges to defer to the reasonable interpretations of agency experts.\nGillian E. Metzger, a Columbia Law School professor who was deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel during the Biden administration, said recent rulings have created openings for presidents<b> </b>to try to increase their authority over agencies.\nThe Trump administration is \u201cpushing to see how far they can get those to go,\u201d she added, calling the departure from precedent that was signaled in the solicitor general\u2019s letter part of a \u201cvery broad effort to hobble and denigrate core institutions of the federal government.\u201d\nIn her letter to Congress, Harris mentioned three independent, multimember regulator agencies whose commissioners \u201cexercise substantial executive power\u201d: the National Labor Relations Board, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. She<b> </b>said the Supreme Court\u2019s 1935 ruling \u201cprevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the Executive Branch who execute the laws on the President\u2019s behalf.\u201d\nBut the same rationale could apply to other agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. The Supreme Court, legal experts said, may be wary about calling into question the structure of the Federal Reserve, in particular, because of the potential destabilizing effects on monetary policy.\n\u201cWhere would they draw the line?\u201d asked Patrick Schmidt, a political science professor and co-director of legal studies at Macalester College.\n<i>Caroline O\u2019Donovan contributed to this report.</i>"

The agency is responsible for education research, evaluation of programs and collection of a vast amount of data about American schools.\nThe vast majority of the work of this agency is done by contractors, so canceling their work will have a significant impact on its ability to function, they said.\nThe canceled contracts were identified by a team of workers from the Department of Government Efficiency service, known as DOGE. The list includes some functions required by statutes.\nNotices to contractors were sent Monday, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak. He said they were canceled \u201cfor convenience,\u201d a provision that allows for a contract to be terminated without finding fault.\nMadi Biedermann, spokeswoman for the department, said three popular programs run by the research arm of the agency were spared: the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a set of nationally representative tests to measure student progress over time, the College Scorecard and the College Navigator.\nBiedermann said the canceled contracts would be rebid in hopes of getting the same or better work done at a lower cost. She said she did not know how or why DOGE concluded that these particular contractors are overpaid or underdelivering.\n\u201cThe significant amount of money as compared to the outcomes generated for students is not commensurate,\u201d she said. She said they are \u201clooking for vendors to generate better outcomes for students.\u201d\nAsked how DOGE workers have the requisite expertise to make these determinations, she said, \u201cThe entire goal of DOGE is to cut waste, and they have been trained to identify that.\u201d\nBiedermann said 90 contracts worth $900 million were canceled.

Biden commuted their sentences to life in prison without parole. While Trump cannot undo those commutations, he raised the possibility that his administration could encourage local officials to seek new death sentences for them.\nWriting in the order, Trump directed his attorney general to examine whether those people could be charged with state-level capital crimes and then \u201crecommend appropriate action to state and local authorities.\u201d\nIn addition to broadly requesting that the Justice Department seek more federal death sentences, Trump directed the attorney general to seek death \u201cfor every federal capital crime\u201d in which a law enforcement officer is murdered or the defendant is in the country illegally.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, the Justice Department restarted executions and carried out 13, including some in the days leading up to Biden\u2019s inauguration. Under Biden, the Justice Department imposed a moratorium blocking new executions, but prosecutors also continued to seek new death sentences.\nBiden\u2019s action commuting sentences last month left three men on federal death row: the surviving Boston Marathon bomber; the Charleston, South Carolina, church gunman; and the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman, who was prosecuted and sentenced to death during Biden\u2019s term.\nTrump has long been a vocal supporter of the death penalty. Capital punishment\u2019s use nationwide has waned in recent decades, with executions and new death sentences plummeting. A Washington Post examination <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2024/death-row-inmates-us-executions/\" target=_blank>last year</a> found that many of the 2,100 people on death row appeared likely to die there without being executed.\nOfficials in some states have not sought to carry out executions, but in other cases, authorities say they have struggled to obtain the drugs needed for lethal injections. Trump\u2019s order also directs his attorney general to make sure that states with the death penalty have the necessary drugs for lethal injections."

Also disqualified are service members who have been treated for gender dysphoria with hormones or surgery.\nThe memo directs the secretaries of each branch to identify service members with gender dysphoria within 30 days and to \u201cbegin separation actions\u201d within 30 days after that.\nThe affected service members will be honorably discharged as long as they meet normal conditions and qualify for involuntary separation pay, the memo states. If they voluntarily step down, they will be eligible to be paid twice as much under voluntary separation pay, it said.\nThe memo also states that the military will no longer pay for any treatments or surgery relating to service members\u2019 gender dysphoria.\nEven if a transgender service member obtains a waiver to stay in the military, they will face restrictions, the memo says. They cannot access \u201cintimate spaces,\u201d including changing rooms, bathrooms and showers, reserved for members of the gender they transitioned to. They will also have to meet the same physical<b> </b>standards as those of the sex they were assigned at birth, and their military records will be updated to reflect their sex assigned at birth.\nAbout 4,200 service members have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to a senior defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Trump administration. That figure includes active-duty, reserve and National Guard personnel.\nBetween 2015 and 2024, the military spent about $52 million on transgender service members\u2019<b> </b>psychotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery and other treatments, the senior defense official said. About 1,000 service members had transition-related surgeries during that period, while about 3,200 received hormone therapy, the official said.\nOpenly transgender people have been allowed to serve in the military since 2016, when the Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/06/30/the-pentagons-ban-on-transgender-service-just-fell-but-the-details-are-complicated/\" target=_blank>repealed a ban on transgender service</a>, citing the value of ensuring that all qualified individuals were able to serve their country in uniform. Previously, the military considered transgender people to be unfit for service.\nObama had also, in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/military-certifies-repeal-of-dont-ask-policy/2011/07/22/gIQAye15TI_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d</a> a policy that prohibited openly gay service members from serving, and, in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/12/03/pentagon-chief-to-announce-how-womens-roles-in-the-military-will-expand/\" target=\"_blank\">opened more combat roles to women</a>. In 2016, Rand published a <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1530.html\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> that found those changes in long-standing policy \u201chad no significant effect on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness\u201d and that concluded there was a \u201cminimal likely impact on force readiness\u201d from allowing openly transgender people to serve too.\nIn subsequent years, military leaders reported no significant harm from allowing openly transgender people to serve. In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2018, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley told Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) that he had \u201creceived precisely zero reports of issues of cohesion, discipline, morale\u201d caused by integrating transgender service members.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, the Defense Department effectively prohibited transgender people from joining the military but allowed those already in uniform to stay on. The policy was challenged in court, but the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-allows-trump-restrictions-on-transgender-troops-in-military-to-go-into-effect-as-legal-battle-continues/2019/01/22/e68a7284-1763-11e9-88fe-f9f77a3bcb6c_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">upheld Trump\u2019s partial ban in 2019</a>.

        "content": "Since taking office, President <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/\" target=_blank>Donald Trump</a> has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/26/trump-trade-war/\" target=_blank>threatened tariffs</a> on an array of trading partners, including Mexico, Canada, Europe, Colombia and India. He has instituted a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/09/china-tariffs-trade-war-united-states/\" target=_blank>10 percent tariff on Chinese goods</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/10/trump-tariffs-steel/\" target=_blank>25 percent tariff on aluminum and steel imports</a>.\nWhich nation ultimately bears the cost of a tariff depends on what that country makes and its pull in the global market. But economists warn that the added tax will largely fall on American businesses and consumers.\n<div class=\"pg-graphic fallback-available\"

        "content": "The day Linda and Jeff Groskreutz stumbled upon a 4,600-square-foot ranch house with long empty walls in Madison Lake, Minnesota, they knew it was the one.\n\u201cIt was perfect,\u201d said Linda, explaining she was excited to finally buy a house with walls expansive enough to display the rewards of her longtime hobby: showstopping, large-scale jigsaw puzzles.\nSince the couple moved in last May, they have turned their new basement into a massive jigsaw gallery, with supersized motifs such as sailboats, fish, planets, elephants, giraffes and tropical birds.\n\nLinda, 67, said that she and Jeff moved from another nearby town in south-central Minnesota because they wanted to be near the lake. But, she added, the big walls were a great bonus.\nThe largest puzzles are showcased in plywood frames handmade by Jeff, who is supportive of his wife\u2019s time-consuming and wall-consuming habit, though he does not puzzle himself.\n\u201cLinda is really good at what she does,\u201d said Jeff, 69.\nHe\u2019s hung a total of about 115,000 pieces in eight of his separate, sprawling frames. One puzzle is so long it spills onto two adjacent walls.\nThen there\u2019s the one Jeff calls \u201cThe Granddaddy\u201d \u2014 a 40,320-piece creation emblazoned with various Disney movie themes. It weighs 44 pounds and measures more than 22 feet across and 6\u00bd feet tall.\nEach of the motifs from 10 Disney movies came in a different bag, and it took Linda 10 weeks to complete the whole thing.\n\u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t have any wall space left, so it sat on cardboard in sections for several years,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil I got a call one day from my minister.\u201d\nHer Lutheran pastor contacted her in 2021 and told her he was preparing a sermon series with a \u201cfitting together\u201d theme, and he wondered if she had a finished puzzle she could put on display at the church. Did she ever.\n\u201cI thought it would be a treat to see my Disney puzzle all together, so we took over each section of the puzzle in the truck and put it together across nine banquet tables,\u201d Linda said. \u201cIt was there for everyone to look at for more than a week.\u201d\nRecently, her puzzles have had an even bigger audience since her husband shared a quick video walk-through of their basement on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o_wVMNIhplw?si=dRqpO1GcUZKcb8fV\" target=_blank>YouTube</a>.\n\u201cThis is a little tour of what I like to call our puzzle room,\u201d Jeff begins<b> </b>in the video. \u201cThis first puzzle is 24,000 pieces. We didn\u2019t have enough wall space to put it all on one wall so we had to wrap it around the inside corner.\u201d\nHe comments that Linda was the first person in Minnesota to complete that puzzle \u2014 which she did in 2008 \u2014 with a touch of help from family and friends. She is featured on <a href=\"https://www.worldslargestpuzzle.com/hof2.html\" target=_blank>a hall-of-fame website for giant puzzle-solvers</a>, where she is quoted as saying: \u201cI look forward to the next \u2018World\u2019s Largest Puzzle\u2019 that I\u2019m sure will come out in the future. My only problem being, that I have no more walls large enough to hold any more of them, so I would have to move.\u201d\nThe next puzzle in the collection that Jeff features with his camera is a 5,000-piece puzzle of the twin towers in New York City. Linda put that one together right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Next are two animal scenes, each with 18,000 pieces. He then shows four others on the walls. Minnesota station <a href=\"https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/land-of-10000-stories/minnesotan-buys-house-to-fit-massive-jigsaw-puzzle-collection/89-60be0703-b73a-4233-9fc8-fca700a92726\" target=_blank>KARE-11</a> recently picked up on the story.\nJeff ends his video with, \u201cWell, thank you very much for coming on this little tour of mine.\u201d\nIn her new house, Linda was thrilled that the Disney puzzle fit across the entire length of one wall, with just two inches to spare.<b> </b>Some of her family members \u2014 she has two children and three grandchildren \u2014 helped lift and install the heavy puzzle.\n\u201cFinally, I have room for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is where it\u2019s going to stay.\u201d\nLinda completes a 1,000-piece puzzle in five to seven hours, she said, and she never needs a magnifying glass.\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably put together a couple thousand puzzles, but only the big ones get framed now and put up,\u201d she said.\nShe has stacks of boxed puzzles neatly piled on a pair of five-story industrial metal shelves, as well as stray jigsaw puzzles scattered on tables nearby.\nAfter she puts in the work to finish an extra large puzzle, she can\u2019t bear to take her masterpieces apart. So she covers them <a href=\"https://www.worldslargestpuzzle.com/hof-042.html\" target=_blank>with thin insulation plastic</a>, and Jeff builds the frames and hangs them \u2014 at least, the ones that fit on the walls.\n\u201cI don\u2019t sleep well, so sometimes I\u2019ll work [on a puzzle] until midnight, or I\u2019ll occasionally get up at 2 or 3 and work on one,\u201d Linda said.\nShe takes apart her favorite small puzzles and puts them back in their boxes so she can piece them together again months later. She said she is also a Sudoku puzzle fan, but adds she\u2019d rather go fishing with her husband than tackle a crossword.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always found doing puzzles relaxing, and I hope they help my brain,\u201d said Linda, pointing out that puzzles <a href=\"https://www.progresslifeline.org.uk/news/the-benefit-of-puzzles-for-the-brain\" target=_blank>help to improve short-term memory</a>.\nShe has been puzzling since she was 10 years old, growing up in rural Minnesota.\nAfter she retired from her accounting job in 2018, she said she decided to devote more time to the hobby.\n\u201cMy parents would give me and my siblings a new 1,000-piece puzzle for Christmas every year, and we\u2019d all work on it together,\u201d Linda recalled. \u201cBut what really got me going was when a relative from Germany came to visit in the late 1990s and learned that I loved puzzles.\u201d\nAs a thank-you gesture for helping him to line up motel rooms for a cross-country trip, the relative sent her a 9,000-piece Tower of Babel jigsaw made by Germany\u2019s famous <a href=\"https://www.ravensburger.com/start/index.html\" target=_blank>Ravensburger puzzle company</a>.\n\u201cThen about four years later, he sent me an 18,000-piece, tropical jungle puzzle,\u201d Linda said. \u201cIt took six months to put it together.\u201d\nTo spread her love of puzzles, she recently started a <a href=\"https://www.puzlib.com/default.php\" target=_blank>puzzle library</a> at a shopping center in nearby Mankato, where about 200 puzzles \u2014 many of them hers \u2014 are available for anyone to check out.\n\u201cIt works like an honor system \u2014 you find the puzzle you want online, then you go pick it up, put it together and bring it back,\u201d Linda said. \u201cPeople have also contributed puzzles they don\u2019t want anymore.\u201d\nShe spends about 20 hours a week piecing together her creations. Her trick is to start with the edges, then fill in the pieces by color. She advises anyone tackling a large puzzle to use a room with good lighting and sort pieces into groups based on their shapes.\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t donate a lot of my own puzzles, they\u2019d quickly take over my house,\u201d she said, guessing she has about 150 at home on her shelves.\nWhen asked by a reporter about her latest jigsaw creation, she stifled a laugh through the phone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle that shows a shelf with a bunch of spices,\u201d Linda said. \u201cI finished it while we were talking.\u201d"

        "content": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico extradited 29 alleged drug traffickers to the United States on Thursday, including Rafael Caro Quintero, a prized target long sought in the killing of a U.S. narcotics agent, and two leaders of the hyper-violent Zetas cartel, in a dramatic gesture apparently aimed at heading off crushing economic sanctions, according to U.S. officials.\nPresident Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on Mexico next week for what he calls its failure to stop drugs \u2014 especially fentanyl \u2014 from crossing the border. A high-level Mexican delegation met Thursday with senior Trump administration officials in an effort to hammer out a deal to avoid the economic penalties.\n\u201cTwenty-nine, that\u2019s huge! What they\u2019ve done is literally cleaned out the cupboard,\u201d said John Feeley, a former U.S. diplomat who served as deputy chief of mission in Mexico from 2009 to 2012. Normally, he said, extraditions of major capos were handled one by one, often involving long negotiations. But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was \u201cpulling out all the stops\u201d to avoid the tariffs, he said.\nThe government <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/sspc/prensa/tarjeta-informativa-391650\" target=_blank>did not identify those extradited</a>. But the U.S. Justice Department said in a news release that  they included <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/07/23/mexico-drug-trafficker-caro-quintero/\" target=_blank>Caro Quintero</a>, who was long the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s most-wanted man. He was accused in the murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena in Mexico in 1985. Caro Quintero was freed from a Mexican prison on a technicality in 2013, to the outrage of DEA officials. After years of pursuing the drug lord, Mexican troops finally arrested him again in 2022.\nAlso sent to the United States were Miguel \u00c1ngel and Omar Trevi\u00f1o Morales, according to the DOJ statement.  Their Zetas cartel dominated much of central and northern Mexico starting around 2007. The group was dismantled a decade ago by the Mexican armed forces, but U.S. authorities alleged the brothers continued to run a Zetas offshoot,  the Northeast cartel, from a Mexican prison.\nThe DOJ release said Mexico carried out the extraditions in response to a recent decision by Trump to designate six Mexican cartels as terrorist groups. The Mexican government did not comment, beyond a brief statement saying the 29 people were sought \u201cbecause of their ties to criminal organizations\u201d involved in drug trafficking.\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown, a drug-policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, said the extraditions are \u201call part and parcel of the package the Mexican government is putting on the table to avoid the 25 percent tariffs.\u201d Mexico also has been alarmed by suggestions from some Trump administration officials that U.S. military strikes should be carried out to weaken the cartels.\nWhile the extraditions were welcome, the U.S. government should instead emphasize a broader demand for law enforcement to actively collaborate with Mexico in rounding up and dismantling criminal networks, Felbab-Brown said.\n\nThe Caro Quintero case has long been extremely sensitive for the DEA; U.S. officials at the highest levels had pressed Mexico to find and rearrest him after he managed to leave prison. He is accused of ordering the kidnapping of Camarena, allegedly as a punishment for the agent\u2019s investigations. Camarena\u2019s body was found on March 5, 1985, in a plastic bag on a remote Mexican ranch.\nThe murder was a central plotline of the Netflix series \u201cNarcos, Mexico.\u201d\nCaro Quintero \u201chas spent four decades atop DEA\u2019s most wanted fugitive list,\u201d said the agency\u2019s acting administrator, Derek S. Maltz. \u201cThis moment is extremely personal for the men and women of DEA.\u201d\nCaro Quintero, 72, was being sent to New York, the  DOJ said. He faces charges of leading a criminal organization and participating in the kidnapping, torture and murder of Camarena. Prosecutors have accused his drug organization of sending tons of methamphetamines, cocaine and heroin from Mexico to the United States from 1980 to 2017.\nThe Trevi\u00f1o Morales brothers have been indicted in the District of Columbia on charges of \u201ctrafficking massive quantities of narcotics into the United States,\u201d Nicole Argentieri, then-head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, said in October.\nThe Zetas were originally formed as an armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. Many of the group\u2019s early members were recruited from Mexican army special-forces troops. The group was known for its extreme cruelty \u2014 including beheading its enemies, killing Central American migrants it suspected of alliances with other groups and burning its enemies\u2019 bodies in diesel-fueled fires.\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-mexico-zetas-kingpins-arrest-is-display-of-new-restrained-style-in-drug-war/2013/07/16/5641c20a-ee32-11e2-bb32-725c8351a69e_story.html\" target=_blank>Miguel \u00c1ngel Morales</a>, in his early 50s, started out as a local gangster in the border town of Nuevo Laredo before joining the Zetas. He was known as Z-40. His younger brother, Omar, or Z-42, succeeded his brother as the Zetas leader following his arrest. Omar was himself detained in 2015.\nTrump had initially said the penalties on Mexico and Canada would take effect in early February unless those countries drastically curbed the flow of migrants and illegal fentanyl over their borders with the United States. Mexico won a temporary reprieve by sending 10,000 extra National Guard forces to the border. But Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning that <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114076153524132682\" target=_blank>he intended to go ahead with the sanctions</a>.\n\u201cDrugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\u201d he wrote.\nFentanyl has set off the deadliest drug epidemic in U.S. history. But deaths from overdoses, and quantities of the opioid seized in the United States, have declined over the past year, officials say.\n<i>Valentina Mu\u00f1oz Castillo and Gabriela Martinez contributed to this report.</i>"

Trump also set the stage for agencies to terminate any enforcement proceedings that seem to run counter to the administration\u2019s beliefs on federal regulation or policy.\nThe White House mandate in some ways formalized a process that occurs at the start of every administration, as new leaders take office and look to shape the federal government to their liking. But Trump, in particular, has already exhibited great willingness to push the limits of presidential power to achieve his agenda \u2014 eliminating entire agencies, programs and funding streams, even those explicitly authorized by Congress, despite the objections of Democrats on Capitol Hill.\nSome of the ideas resemble Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for his presidency prepared by the Heritage Foundation ahead of the 2024 elections. Its contributors include Russell Vought, who is set to play a critical role overseeing federal agencies as White House budget director."

        "headline": "Several administration officials tell workers not to reply to Musk email",
        "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s demand that all 2.3 million government workers<b> </b>justify their work prompted confusion and resistance on Sunday, as several government agency leaders told their staffs not to reply to a mass email requesting bullet-point summations of their accomplishments.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard instructed personnel in U.S. spy agencies not to respond, according to the text of an email she sent to the workforce on Sunday, citing the agencies\u2019 sensitive and classified work. Defense Department employees were given similar instructions to not respond, as were FBI personnel<b> </b>and Department of Homeland Security employees.\nThe latest directives<b> </b>come as employees and leaders alike across the government were caught off guard by an email sent Saturday titled: \u201cWhat did you do last week?\u201d\nIt commanded federal employees to \u201creply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,\u201d according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. It gave employees a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time Monday.\nThe email left many worried, others defiant and still others stunned. The resistance, which grew throughout the weekend, came even from some top administration officials selected by President Donald Trump.\nEmployees at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency were told definitively to reply \u2014 a few hours before DHS sent a note saying the opposite. In some parts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, staffers received instructions to draft a response but not send it yet. At other agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, employees were first given one instruction only to be emailed later to pause and watch for more guidance Monday.\nRaising the stakes, Musk warned in a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893386883444437415\">post on X</a> that any employee who failed to respond would be treated as having resigned. But the email sent to workers made no mention of that possible consequence, which lawyers said would be illegal.\nMusk\u2019s threat also appears to contradict an <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/media/kfpozkad/gwes-pia.pdf\" target=_blank>assessment released on Feb. 5</a> by the Office of Personnel Management that concluded that any responses to government-wide emails must be \u201cexplicitly voluntary.\u201d Yet the weekend email was sent by an address at OPM, which serves as human resources for the entire federal government \u2014 and has been largely taken over by Musk\u2019s U.S. DOGE Service.\nOn Sunday, a Republican lawmaker questioned the viability of the directive.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how that\u2019s necessarily feasible,\u201d Rep. Michael Lawler (New York) said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cObviously, a lot of federal employees are under union contract.\u201d\nMany employees at certain agencies cannot disclose information about their work to third parties without explicit authorization, security experts noted. Some warned of security risks if all 2.3 million federal employees are forced to reply to one email server sharing their contact information, their manager\u2019s contact information and details about the work they do.\nWorries at intelligence agencies\nConcerns ran especially deep among employees of the Defense Department, intelligence agencies and the military, according to messages and interviews with more than 300 federal employees.\n\u201cEven if people don\u2019t send classified information, the aggregation of all this information in one place would become classified information, which is a national security violation,\u201d warned one active-duty military officer who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. \u201cThe military cannot function without the DOD federal workforce. This is a national security issue to treat the workforce this way.\u201d\nAt the Justice Department, managers were advised late Saturday evening that all employees should be prepared to submit responses to the email on Monday. But rank-and-file FBI employees and staff in at least three U.S. attorney\u2019s offices across the country said Sunday that the last guidance they received from their direct managers was not to reply to the email before receiving further instructions.\nIn a bureau-wide communication Saturday evening, newly installed FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI would \u201cconduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures.\u201d\nAt the Secret Service, the OPM email prompted a flurry of texts and emails to supervisors among agents and officers about whether they were expected to reveal the sensitive and classified details of their job duties the previous week, according to two people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal communications.\nTo prevent agents from having to describe classified tasks they perform to protect the president and other high-ranking officials, senior officials initially instructed their subordinate agents to send an example response, beginning with: \u201cThis week I accomplished: 100% of the tasks and duties required of me by my position description\u201d and \u201c100% of the work product that my manager and I have agreed to.\u201d\nThe fifth and final bullet said: \u201cI exceeded expectations in the delivery of the above.\u201d\nOn online forums, many employees cheered the boilerplate language, before DHS told staff early Sunday evening that no one should respond, including those in component offices such as the Secret Service.\n\nAt the State Department, Tibor P. Nagy, acting undersecretary of state for management, said in a message obtained by The Post the department \u201cwill respond on behalf of the Department,\u201d adding that \u201cno employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command.\u201d\nSimilar messages went out to employees at a division within the Air Force, the Defense Information Systems Agency and the National Science Foundation, where the chief management officer said in a note to employees that the NSF did not receive advanced notice or guidance about the email.\nMusk stands firm, as directive costs workers time\nOn Saturday night and throughout Sunday, Musk doubled down on the directive. On X, the social media platform he owns, he stated that the email was necessary to ferret out government employees who are \u201cdoing so little work that they are not checking their email.\u201d He claimed, without evidence, that there were \u201cnon-existent people or the identities of dead people\u201d pretending to be government workers. Many Republican lawmakers defended the message, arguing it would only take a few minutes to reply.\nBut it caused uncertainty \u2014 and ate up people\u2019s time across the government. In the Air Force department, for example, some supervisors spent their Sundays phoning or texting each one of their subordinates to ensure they had seen both Musk\u2019s email and later guidance saying not to reply to it, according to several employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\nThe chaos extended beyond the executive branch. At the Library of Congress, which is part of the separate legislative branch, staff received an email Sunday afternoon saying the OPM note was not meant for them and they should not respond.\nSome judges and judiciary staff, who are also not in the executive branch, also received the OPM email, according to a note obtained by The Post from the director\u2019s office of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which staffs the judiciary branch. The message said no action should be taken and that the office would contact OPM about the Musk email.\nOther workers and agencies were unsure if the email was real, given its unorthodox timing.\n\u201cIt is possible that this new message sent outside of normal business hours was sent in error and/or is a phishing attempt,\u201d said an email to some staff from NOAA leadership. \u201cUntil such time as we can verify that the message that was received \u2026 is authentic, please do not respond.\u201d\nThe email also prompted defiance from Democrats and angry workers exhausted by Musk\u2019s efforts.\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) said in a statement Sunday that Democrats would block Musk in Congress and the courts.\n\u201cElon Musk is traumatizing hardworking federal employees, their children and families,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cHe has no legal authority to make his latest demands.\u201d\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) called the request \u201cabsurd\u201d and defended government employees. \u201cIf Elon Musk truly wants to understand what federal workers accomplished over the past week, he should get to know each department and agency, and learn about the jobs he\u2019s trying to cut.\u201d\nAt least one staffer responded to the email with resistance. A worker with the U.S. Geological Survey forwarded the \u201cWhat did you do last week?\u201d email to his direct supervisors informing them he \u201ccategorically\u201d refused to reply.\n\u201cThere is no way that a team of people will read &gt;2 million responses to this message,\u201d the employee wrote. \u201cAnyone who replies is likely to have their responses fed into some AI woodchipper and used for goodness knows what purpose, legal or illegal.\u201d\nHe then urged his bosses to defend their employees and \u201cpush back on these efforts to harass and intimidate us. We are all watching to see whose side you are on.\u201d\nLeaders within a NASA directorate advertised the email as a chance to tout workers\u2019 accomplishments, writing that employees should reply with speed, accuracy and detail.\n\u201cIn just the next two weeks we have 4 launches and 2 lunar landings with missions that will expand our understanding of the first stages of the Universe,\u201d the NASA email stated. \u201cEvery one of you play key roles in these momentous endeavors \u2026 and can supply many more than just 5 accomplishments in any given week to showcase our mission.\u201d\nBut at almost the same time elsewhere within NASA, another group of employees received opposite instructions.\nOne director wrote, \u201cI recognize there are many concerns already being elevated around the request [including] data that would be sent un-encrypted. \u2026 The agency is asking employees to take a pause and wait for additional communication and guidance.\u201d\nAnd on Sunday morning, the NASA directorate that had urged employees to reply reversed its guidance. \u201cPlease go ahead and prepare your bullets but do not submit \u2026 until you receive further guidance,\u201d a leader there wrote.\n\n<i>Ellen Nakashima, John Hudson, Mariana Alfaro, Warren Strobel, Derek Hawkins, Spencer S.

Noem has decided to end temporary humanitarian protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans who sought refuge in the United States in the past few years, putting them at imminent risk of being forced to return to the autocratic regime they left behind in South America.\nNoem wrote that conditions in Venezuela \u201cno longer\u201d met the criteria for its citizens to qualify for temporary protected status, which was set to expire in April for those who became eligible for it in 2023, according to a copy of the <a href=\"https://washingtonpost.com/documents/cfb3c9b8-fff3-49eb-98dd-d2a3fcd9b891.pdf\" target=_blank>unpublished notice</a> that DHS released Sunday.\nThe Biden administration had extended their protections through the fall of 2026, citing extreme poverty and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/10/el-salvador-temporary-protected-status/\" target=_blank>economic and political crises</a>. But the Trump administration quickly reversed that decision, and now the group that received temporary protection in 2023 could lose it 60 days after the notice is officially published in the Federal Register. Officials did not say when it could publish.\nNoem also determined that allowing Venezuelans to live and work in the United States is \u201ccontrary to the national interest,\u201d she said, citing gang activity \u2014 though criminals are generally ineligible for temporary protection \u2014 as well as the cost to cities such as New York to shelter migrants and other concerns.\nNoem acknowledged that Venezuela is still struggling with many of the issues that the Biden administration raised, but she said there were \u201cnotable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime.\u201d\n\u201cIn particular, the Secretary has determined it is contrary to the national interest to permit the covered Venezuelan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States,\u201d the notice said. The New York Times first reported on the protection revocations.\nEnding protections for Venezuelans is a marked shift for the Trump administration, which granted them reprieves from deportation during his first term, and Noem\u2019s decision is expected to face legal challenges. Her announcement comes a day after President Donald Trump said <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/01/trump-venezuela-deportation-maduro-migrants/\" target=_blank>the government</a> of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro would accept the return of Venezuelans.\nTrump has vowed to carry out mass deportations and his administration launched with a blitz of immigration arrests nationwide. Trump officials emphasize that criminals are their top priority for removal but say that anyone in the United States illegally could be deported.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who is on a tour of Latin America, lobbied intensively for the temporary protections as a U.S. senator, writing in 2022 that it would be a \u201cvery real death sentence\u201d to force Venezuelans to return home.\nRubio referred questions to DHS last week after Noem reversed the Biden administration\u2019s extension of protections for Venezuelans.\nIn one of the last acts of his first term, Trump granted <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferred-enforced-departure-certain-venezuelans/\" target=_blank>Venezuelans</a> permission to stay in the United States because of the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d conditions in their homeland.\nPolitical support for Venezuelans waned, however, after the slaying last year of a Georgia nursing student by a man from Venezuela with a criminal history, including shoplifting.\nA House investigation into the man\u2019s immigration status found that he had crossed the border illegally and sought <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/08-16-2024-The-Case-of-the-Illegal-Alien-Who-Murdered-Laken-Riley.pdf\" target=_blank>asylum</a>, but it did not find that he had temporary protected status.<b> </b>Trump repeatedly referred to the murder on the campaign trail and he recently signed into law the Laken Riley Act, expanding mandatory detention for immigrants arrested for theft-related crimes.\nHuman rights organizations, immigration lawyers and politicians condemned Noem\u2019s decision Sunday, given the continuing emergencies in Venezuela, including shortages of food, water and electricity, and political crackdowns against Maduro opponents.\n\u201cThere is bipartisan agreement that TPS recipients from Venezuela shouldn\u2019t be forced to return to extremely dangerous conditions,\u201d Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada) said in a statement Sunday. \u201cNothing about Venezuela\u2019s communist regime has changed since 2023, and taking away these protections for hardworking families doesn\u2019t make our country any safer.\u201d\n\nWilfredo Allen, a South Florida immigration attorney, said Noem\u2019s decision was \u201cshocking\u201d given that Trump withdrew diplomatic personnel from Venezuela in 2019 and has maintained sanctions against the country.\nAhilan Arulanantham, a UCLA law professor who led the lawsuit that blocked Trump from terminating protections for Haitians and other groups during his first term, said Noem\u2019s actions are \u201cplainly illegal.\u201d\nVenezuelans are the largest group by far in the United States with temporary protected status, a humanitarian program created under a 1990 law for people from countries destabilized by war, a natural disaster or another emergency.\nSoon before he left office, President Joe Biden\u2019s Department of Homeland Security secretary, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/02/05/alejandro-mayorkas-impeachment-and-border-legacy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4\" target=_blank>Alejandro Mayorkas</a>, extended protections for up to 600,000 Venezuelans through <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/10/el-salvador-temporary-protected-status/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4\" target=_blank>October 2026</a>.\nHe had granted them temporary protected status in 2021 and 2023. The 2023 group\u2019s protections were set to expire April 2, while the 2021 group\u2019s status will expire Sept. 10.\nCritics of the TPS program have long argued that repeat extensions flout the temporary intent of the law. Most of those who apply don\u2019t otherwise qualify for legal status, and on his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order saying that the program should be \u201climited in scope.\u201d\nImmigrants from 17 countries have the protection, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the program. Before he left office, Mayorkas expanded protections for about 85 percent of those enrolled in the program, including<b> </b>El Salvador, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/01/10/dhs-extend-temporary-protected-status-ukraine\" target=_blank>Ukraine</a> and Sudan.\nProtections for other countries, such as Honduras, are set to expire in the coming months.\n\nIn her analysis, Noem said TPS allowed a \u201csignificant population\u201d of Venezuelans with no clear path to<b> </b>a<b> </b>lawful immigration status into the United States, and said extending temporary protections could encourage more to arrive.\nAbby Maxman, president and chief executive of Oxfam America, said TPS recipients are already integrated into communities across the United States, and needed to work in health care, construction and farming.\n\u201cRevoking TPS is not only inhumane but also economically disastrous,\u201d she said in a statement, calling the move \u201ca direct attack on families and communities who have sought safety and stability in the United States.\u201d\n<i>Mariana Alfaro contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. granted the Trump administration\u2019s request late Wednesday to pause a lower court\u2019s midnight deadline for the government to resume nearly $2 billion in foreign aid payments suspended for weeks.\nThe brief administrative order, which did not address the underlying legal issues, will allow time for a full Supreme Court review.\nU.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali had given the administration until 11:59 p.m. to fulfill its contractual obligations and restart the payments to organizations whose work in impoverished parts of the world had been stopped since President Donald Trump halted such foreign assistance in late January.\nActing solicitor general Sarah M. Harris, the government\u2019s top appellate lawyer, had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25546029-24a831/\" target=_blank>asked the Supreme Court to block Ali\u2019s order</a>, which she said had \u201cthrown what should be an orderly review by the government into chaos.\u201d\nThe lower-court order, Harris wrote, exceeds the judiciary\u2019s authority. The government is \u201ccommitted to paying legitimate claims for work that was properly completed,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat the government cannot do is pay arbitrarily determined demands on an arbitrary timeline of the district court\u2019s choosing.\u201d\nRoberts gave the global aid organizations challenging the administration\u2019s actions until noon Friday to respond to those assertions.\nThe request to the Supreme Court marked the second time the new administration has asked the justices to intervene after a lower-court judge blocked Trump\u2019s efforts to reshape the federal government. Last week, the high court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/21/trump-dellinger-fire-supreme-court/\" target=_blank>refused to immediately clear the way</a> for the removal of Hampton Dellinger, the head of an independent watchdog agency, whom Trump tried to fire.\nTrump issued the wide-ranging pause on foreign aid shortly after his inauguration. His allies quickly began dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, the $40 billion arm of the government that assists humanitarian work in more than 100 countries. The moves <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/04/africa-trump-musk-usaid-funding-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">left millions of people at risk of hunger and illness</a> and thousands of USAID employees without jobs, some stranded in dangerous places around the world.\nTwo groups \u2014 the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council \u2014 filed suit. On Feb. 13, Ali, a Biden appointee who has been on the bench only since December, issued a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/14/usaid-trump-farmers-food-for-peace-kansas/\" target=_blank>temporary restraining order</a> prohibiting the administration from stopping the aid payments.\nBut in the days that followed, advocates alleged in court, administration officials openly defied the order, continued to lay off thousands of staffers and contractors, and started terminating thousands of grants that did not fit the administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio had earlier exempted some of the relief programs from the pause for work deemed \u201clifesaving.\u201d But a key payment system has remained largely offline, which has left aid partners without enough cash to continue their work and stranded thousands of pounds of food and medicine far from the communities desperate for help.\nOn Tuesday, Ali gave officials his deadline for restarting payments. The Trump administration immediately appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, saying that disbursing nearly $2 billion payments would take weeks.\nThree hours before Ali\u2019s deadline, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit<a href=\"https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/orders/docs/2025/02/25-5046LDSD.pdf\" target=_blank> turned away</a> the administration\u2019s request, saying it does not have the right to appeal at this early stage of the litigation before the U.S. district judge has finished his work.\nAt that point, the solicitor general\u2019s office had already asked the Supreme Court to intervene.\nHarris told the justices that the government cannot function and the president cannot carry out his duties over foreign affairs if \u201ca district court can appoint itself the claims-processor for the federal government and second-guess the Executive Branch\u2019s determinations.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the plaintiffs alleged that a small number of Trump\u2019s political appointees, acting at the direction of Trump adviser Elon Musk, were refusing to authorize or vetoing the back payments to foreign aid.\nA Trump administration official said via email Wednesday evening that the State Department and USAID had just completed a review of its programming, identifying nearly $4.4 billion in grants for elimination. Nearly 5,800 awards were targeted for elimination as part of \u201cthe America First agenda,\u201d the official said.\nUSAID retained critical awards, including food assistance, lifesaving medical treatments for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, and support for nations like Lebanon, Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba, the official said.\nThe review had been ongoing when Ali \u201cintervened\u201d in the process, the official added, and the State Department and USAID moved \u201crapidly to complete the programmatic evaluation,\u201d lifting stop-work orders for some programs and terminating others.\nAid groups and contractors told The Washington Post on Wednesday that they were receiving government notices of thousands of aid projects being terminated, despite the federal judge\u2019s ruling that foreign assistance should continue.\n<i>John Hudson contributed to this report.</i>"

Nearly half the federal spending cuts proposed in the resolution would come through the House committee that oversees Medicaid, and Democrats argued that cuts to the program were all but inevitable.\nDemocratic-aligned groups released reams of polling and data on Medicaid, breaking it down by congressional district in some cases.\nThe Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, <a href=\"https://www.americanprogressaction.org/article/these-15-congressional-districts-would-see-large-medicaid-funding-losses-under-republican-house-budget-resolution/\" target=\"_blank\">released a list of 15 GOP-held districts</a> that it said would see \u201clarge\u201d Medicaid losses if the House Energy and Commerce Committee fully cut from Medicaid under the budget blueprint. Many of those districts are represented by some of the most vulnerable House Republicans.\nThe pushback illustrated Democratic confidence that even though the midterms are well over a year away, messing with Medicaid could be politically fatal for the GOP.\nIn a memo released Monday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee argued that vulnerable House Republicans would be \u201csealing their political fate\u201d by supporting the budget resolution. The DCCC reiterated the sentiment after the vote, saying in a statement on Republicans\u2019 support for the resolution that \u201cno amount of their desperate lies will save them from the political fallout of this vote.\u201d\nSome House Republicans in competitive districts raced to explain their vote within minutes of the resolution\u2019s approval.\n\u201cThe Budget Resolution passed today does not specify any cuts to federal programs,\u201d Rep. <b>Ken Calvert</b> (R-California) said in a statement, without mentioning Medicaid by name. \u201cI want to make it clear that I do not support cuts to Social Security, Medicare and the safety net programs our vulnerable Americans rely on.\u201d\nThe House GOP campaign arm went on offense after the vote by focusing on how the resolution sets the stage for the extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts. The National Republican Congressional Committee argued that vulnerable House Democrats had just voted to \u201craise taxes on MILLIONS of American families and small businesses.\u201d\nBut it was House GOP leaders who spent yesterday trying to unify their conference behind the budget resolution, looking to quash reservations \u2014 or outright opposition \u2014 from the center and the right.\n\u201cThe word \u2018Medicaid\u2019 is not even in this bill,\u201d House Majority Leader <b>Steve Scalise</b> (R-Louisiana) said yesterday at a news conference, holding up the budget resolution and pointing at it. \u201cThis bill doesn\u2019t even mention the word \u2018Medicaid\u2019 a single time, and yet all Democrats are doing is lying about what\u2019s in the budget because they don\u2019t want to talk about the truth of what we\u2019re voting to start. We\u2019re voting to start a process. This doesn\u2019t end the process.\u201d\n\u201cClearly we\u2019ve hit a nerve,\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chairman <b>Pete Aguilar</b> (California) told reporters a short time later.\nPrivately, many House Republicans tell our colleague <b>Marianna Sotomayor</b> that drafting policies to match the strict spending levels will result in cuts and that Democrats are not \u201cfearmongering,\u201d as GOP leaders alleged yesterday, that cuts would affect social benefits such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\nRep. <b>Juan Ciscomani </b>(R-Arizona), who was part of a group of Hispanic Republicans that had raised concerns about potential Medicaid cuts, told reporters hours before the vote that GOP leaders were hearing him out.\n\u201cThe Hispanic community, along with the rest of the country, trusted us with this mandate,\u201d Ciscomani said, \u201cand they want us to rein in the government spending, and they also want to make sure that their loved ones are protected with health insurance.\u201d\nAnother vulnerable House Republican \u2014 Rep. <b>Michael Lawler</b> (New York) \u2014 echoed Scalise hours before the vote.\n\u201cThe budget resolution is simply about unlocking the ability to negotiate a bill,\u201d Lawler told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s ultimately what today is about. The Democrats will try to make it about all sorts of things, but show me where in the budget resolution it talks about specific cuts. It doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s early in the cycle, some of the Democratic challengers who have already launched campaigns against vulnerable House Republicans released statements yesterday adding to the pressure on them. One of those challengers was <b>Rebecca Bennett</b>, a former Navy helicopter pilot who\u2019s running against Rep. <b>Tom Kean Jr. </b>(R-New Jersey).\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Congressman Kean to show residents of the 7th District where he stands on this critical issue \u2014 will he vote to protect the health care of thousands of families and children?\u201d Bennett said in a statement. \u201cThat should be an easy decision.\u201d\nKean\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nWhat\u2019s next? The House and Senate have passed different proposals to craft Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d so both sides must deconflict and pass the same budget resolution to start putting policy to paper.\nAt the White House\nElon Musk joins Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting\nTrump is set to hold his first Cabinet meeting today with<b> </b>a special guest: <b>Elon Musk</b>.\nWhite House press secretary <b>Karoline Leavitt </b>told reporters yesterday that Musk, head of the U.S. DOGE Service, will attend the meeting to \u201ctalk about DOGE\u2019s efforts and how all of the Cabinet secretaries are identifying waste, fraud and abuse in their respective agencies.\u201d\nIt will serve as another reminder of the extraordinary \u2014 and controversial \u2014 role that Musk is playing in the Trump administration. And it will come after some Cabinet secretaries urged their employees not to respond to a recent email from Musk telling them to share what they worked on in the past week.\nLeavitt said Trump respected the decisions of those Cabinet secretaries but downplayed any tensions. Trump, Musk and the secretaries are \u201cworking as one team,\u201d she said.\nWhat we\u2019re watching\nTrump\nTrump is set to hold the Cabinet meeting at 11 a.m. in the Cabinet Room. At 3 p.m., he is scheduled to sign executive orders in the Oval Office.\nCongress\nThe House and Senate are scheduled to come in at 10 a.m.\nThe Senate is set to continue considering Trump\u2019s nomination of <b>Jamieson Greer</b> to be U.S. trade representative.\nAt 10:15 a.m., the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold a confirmation hearing for three Trump nominees to the Justice Department: <b>D. John Sauer</b> to be solicitor general, as well as <b>Harmeet Dhillon</b> and <b>Aaron Reitz</b> to be assistant attorneys general.\nThe campaign\nDonalds announces Florida gubernatorial campaign\nRep. <b>Byron Donalds</b> (R-Florida) made it official last night: He\u2019s running for Florida governor.\nHe announced the move on Fox News days after Trump endorsed him, instantly making him a formidable candidate to succeed term-limited Gov. <b>Ron DeSantis</b> (R) in the 2026 election.\nDeSantis made clear Monday he is not on board with Donalds, criticizing him as absent from recent conservative victories in Florida. DeSantis also talked up his wife, <b>Casey DeSantis</b>, as a possible gubernatorial candidate.\nAsked about her potential candidacy on Fox, Donalds said it\u2019s \u201cvery early\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d \u2014 but he was quick to emphasize he has Trump\u2019s endorsement. As for Ron DeSantis, Donalds said the governor has done \u201ca tremendous job\u201d and then offered an implicit response to DeSantis\u2019s recent criticism.\n\u201cFor a long time, I\u2019ve been in the trenches of a lot of these battles dealing with conservatism,\u201d Donalds said, referring to his time as a state legislator.\nPoll Watch\nVirginia gubernatorial poll shows unsettled contest\nA poll shows that one of the marquee elections of the year \u2014 the Virginia governor\u2019s race \u2014 is far from settled. The <a href=\"https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_february_2025\" target=_blank>survey from Roanoke College</a> found that nearly a third of voters \u2014 32 percent \u2014 were undecided in a hypothetical November matchup between Democrat <b>Abigail Spanberger</b> and Republican <b>Winsome Earle-Sears</b>. Spanberger, a<b> </b>former Virginia congresswoman, received the support of 39 percent of voters, while Earle-Sears, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, garnered 24 percent. Each is the front-runner for her party\u2019s nomination in the June primaries.\nThe Media\n<b>Must reads:</b>\n<b>From The Post:</b>\n<b>From across the web:</b>\nViral\n<b>If you have to ask \u2026</b>\nThanks for reading.

        "headline": "With Gaza rule at stake, Palestinian forces struggle to make their case",
        "content": "JENIN, West Bank \u2014 The Palestinian Authority recently took a high-stakes gamble in this restive city, launching a major military operation aimed at clipping the wings of militant groups that had grown in influence and audacity.\nIf the operation succeeded, Palestinian security forces would demonstrate they could maintain order not only in the parts of the West Bank they nominally control but also, if given the chance, perhaps in Gaza as well. The role of the Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza is very much a live question as foreign powers and Arab states now debate the future of the war-torn enclave.\nBut the six-week campaign in Jenin, which lost momentum after Israeli forces intervened last month, ultimately came up badly short and exposed some of the challenges the authority would face in securing Gaza. While the security forces arrested dozens of Iranian-backed fighters, high-profile militants remain at large.\nThe clashes highlighted how poorly equipped the Palestinian Authority security forces are compared with the groups they are seeking to subdue. The campaign also underlined questions about how far Palestinians would go to fight fellow Palestinians and whether the authority could maintain its popular legitimacy if it did so. Moreover, the events in Jenin revealed how Israel\u2019s actions, which include its own withering attacks<b> </b>on targets in the city, undermine the ability of the Palestinian Authority to exert its control.\nThe battle between the Palestinian security forces and an umbrella group of fighters in Jenin led by Palestinian Islamic Jihad left 15 dead, including at least six civilians, and dozens injured, a spokesman for the authority\u2019s forces said.\nThe questions raised about the Palestinian Authority\u2019s ability to rule come as governments in the region are racing by the end of this month to present a counterproposal to President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to displace all of the Gaza Strip\u2019s 2.2 million inhabitants. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there must be no role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, an alternative Arab plan, expected in the coming weeks, is certain to give the authority a central role, despite profound concerns about its capabilities.\nThe Jenin operation \u201cdemonstrated the limits of the PA security forces,\u201d said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIf you cannot succeed decisively in an operation like Jenin, how can you hope to tackle the infinitely more complex situation in Gaza?\u201d\nFirepower put to the test\nThe Jenin campaign was the biggest test so far of the Palestinian Authority forces, which are responsible for security control in the West Bank\u2019s major Palestinian population centers under the terms of the peace deal reached with Israel in the 1990s.\nThe forces include about 35,000 members and coordinate security and share intelligence with Israel, which continues to occupy the West Bank. The U.S. government has given Palestinian security forces about $1.1 billion since 2007, State Department officials said last year, and has supervised their training in Jordan. The Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/19/trump-aid-freeze-palestinian-authority-israel/\" target=_blank>stopped all funding to the Palestinian Authority security forces</a> as part of the global freeze on foreign assistance, according to U.S. and Palestinian officials.\nAt a news conference last month and in an interview last week, Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, spokesman for the security forces, outlined what he said were the accomplishments of the Jenin operation: Hundreds of militants and accomplices arrested. Illicit funds, explosives and weapons seized. Improvised bombs that had been planted in neighborhoods \u2014 meant, the militants said, to target Israeli soldiers \u2014 were defused.\n\u201cThe security services have the ability and readiness to deal with the situation in Gaza,\u201d Rajab said in the interview.\nBut Jenin residents, Israeli officials and analysts have panned the operation.\n\u201cIf the end result is that everybody in the world \u2014 and especially the U.S. and the Arab countries \u2014 see that the PA can\u2019t get control of 100 militants in Jenin, how can they secure Gaza?\u201d said Mairav Zonszein, senior Israel analyst at the International Crisis Group.\nAfter laying siege for about six weeks to the Jenin refugee camp, which is adjacent to the city, Palestinian security forces remained unable to penetrate its maze of narrow alleys. When Washington Post journalists visited the camp on two occasions in mid-January, armed militants strolled the streets while scouts with walkie-talkies stood watch on rooftops, unbothered by sporadic bursts of gunfire from security forces on the mountain above.\nThe operation was taxing for the residents of the camp. But compared with raids by the Israeli troops, for the militants, it was \u201ca break, a vacation,\u201d said Jihad, a senior member of the Jenin Battalion, the umbrella group of militants. Like some others interviewed for this story, Jihad gave only his first name out of fear of retribution.\nThe Jenin Battalion is better armed than the security forces, according to Tahani Mustafa, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst for the Palestinian territories. Many have M-16 rifles smuggled in from Jordan or bought from weapons traffickers in Israel, Jihad said. The authority\u2019s forces, in contrast, carry old Kalashnikov rifles. Israel has barred the Palestinian security forces from importing better weapons, ammunition and light armored vehicles.\nIn early January, the militants demonstrated their continued capabilities by shooting dead three Israelis driving through Funduq, a village outside the city. The Jenin Battalion claimed responsibility. Then, Jihad said, the gunmen slipped undetected back into the camp to take refuge.\nThe attack \u201cwas first a message to the PA, because they are besieging us, but that won\u2019t end our resistance against the occupation,\u201d he said.\nContrary to the authority\u2019s claims, Jihad said that only a handful of those arrested by the middle of last month were members of the battalion and that only one militant fighter had been killed by the security forces. Two other victims were unaffiliated teenagers.\nThe authority\u2019s forces, meanwhile, lost six members. Many others sustained injuries, a colonel who directs training at the authority\u2019s Central Training Institute for security forces said, speaking on the condition of anonymity according to his office\u2019s protocol.\nDuring a recent assessment of the operation, Palestinian security leaders concluded their forces had fallen short in hitting targets, engaging in close-quarters gun battles and dismantling improvised explosive devices, the colonel said. \u201cOur men have very basic experience and don\u2019t have protective gear, and the situation for them was very hard,\u201d he added.\nLoyalty put to the test\nViolence among Palestinian factions is hardly unprecedented. A bloody battle in Gaza in 2007 between Hamas and the Fatah party, which controls the Palestinian Authority, left dozens dead and culminated in the authority\u2019s ouster from the enclave. But for years, the internecine fighting had not reached the level recently seen in Jenin.\nThe military campaign this winter tested the loyalties of some authority security officers, raising questions about their willingness to turn their guns on other Palestinians. In one widely shared video, an officer from Jenin camp, Mustafa al-Qaniri, publicly resigned in protest. (His son, Ibrahim, whom Hamas claimed as a member, was later killed in an Israeli airstrike.)\nPalestinian Authority security personnel once commanded more respect in Palestinian society. It was \u201ca good job with a good salary,\u201d said a woman in Jenin named Alaa, whose husband signed on with the force more than a decade ago. But when he received orders in December to deploy in Jenin, he refused. \u201cIf he would fight against his people, how could he look them in the eyes?\u201d asked Alaa.\nHis family regarded Israelis, and not their fellow Palestinians, as the enemy. \u201cTo see someone from the same religion, same nationality, fighting against you? I feel like my heart is really breaking,\u201d said the family matriarch, Umm Hassan.\nThe authority was already unpopular with many Palestinians, due to concerns over corruption and ineptitude. But according to interviews in Jenin, the operation there made enemies out of skeptics, triggered blowback even among some authority supporters \u2014 and underscored how the authority\u2019s legitimacy is at risk when it cracks down on armed elements.\nThe campaign against the militants touched a nerve among many here who are frustrated with the authority\u2019s inaction in the face of raids by the Israeli military and rising violence by Israeli settlers. Eager to prevent an open war with Israel, the Palestinian Authority avoids confrontation with Israeli forces, so militant groups have positioned themselves as Jenin\u2019s defenders.\nIn the Damaj neighborhood, a militant hot spot, Issam Abu Amira, 50, surveyed the blackened husk of what had once been his home. Fourteen houses in the camp were torched in total. While the Palestinian Authority blamed militants, Jenin Mayor Mohammad Jarrar said authority forces were responsible.\nDown the street, Abu Amira\u2019s cousin, Amjad, 24, pointed to the cracked glass where a bullet had pierced his parents\u2019 bedroom window while they were sleeping. \u201cBefore this,\u201d he said, \u201cwe had no problem with the PA.\u201d\nNow, his mother, Umm Ibrahim, chimed in, \u201cwe hate them.\u201d Could she forgive the Palestinian Authority? \u201cNever,\u201d she said.\nThe Israeli military strikes\nIn mid-January, community leaders in Jenin brokered a truce agreement that would have ended the campaign by the Palestinian security forces and allowed the militants to hold onto their weapons, as long as they were discreet.\nA week later, the Israeli military resumed airstrikes in Jenin, killing 12 people over two nights, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. This was part of a major West Bank operation that has lasted more than three weeks, killing at least 25 people in the Jenin area \u2014 including the Funduq attackers \u2014 and displaced thousands of civilians, according to the Palestinian Authority, Israeli military and the United Nations.\nIsraeli officials said their operation was necessary because the authority had failed to root out Iranian-backed militancy. The authority has been \u201cspectacularly unsuccessful in countering terrorism in Jenin in particular,\u201d David Mencer, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office, said in a news conference last week.\nBut the campaign undermined the standing of the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian officials and Middle East analysts said that might have been part of the intention for a right-wing government that includes ministers opposed to the authority\u2019s existence.\n\u201cThe minute the Gaza ceasefire went into effect, the operation started in the West Bank. \u2026 On the political level, I see it as a way the [Israeli] government is asserting itself. It\u2019s saying, \u2018We still control you,\u2019\u201d Zonszein said.\nThe Israeli operation was \u201cmeant to embarrass the PA,\u201d according to Jarrar, Jenin\u2019s mayor. He added, \u201cI told them: \u2018The Israelis want you to be seen as crippled, ineffectual.\u2019\u201d\nThe sequence of events fueled the perception among Palestinians that Israel and the Palestinian Authority were working in tandem. The Israeli campaign flushed militants out of the camp, allowing Palestinian security officers to arrest dozens of fighters in the surrounding countryside.\nThe Palestinian security forces \u201claid the groundwork for the Israelis,\u201d said Nasser, Umm Ibrahim\u2019s husband.\n<i>Miriam Berger in Jericho, John Hudson in Washington and Heidi Levine in Jenin contributed to this report.</i>"

        "content": "Pope Francis sharply rebuked President Donald Trump\u2019s policy of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and urged American Catholics not to lean into anti-immigrant sentiment in an open letter to U.S. Catholic bishops Tuesday.\n\u201cI exhort all the faithful of the Catholic Church, and all men and women of good will, not to give in to narratives that discriminate against and cause unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters,\u201d Francis wrote in a lengthy letter.\nThe letter served as a strong rejection of Trump\u2019s treatment of migrants, with the pope emphasizing that \u201can authentic rule of law is verified precisely in the dignified treatment that all people deserve, especially the poorest and most marginalized.\u201d He warned that criminalizing immigrants for their legal status deprives them of their dignity and \u201cwill end badly.\u201d\n\u201cThe true common good is promoted when society and government, with creativity and strict respect for the rights of all \u2014 as I have affirmed on numerous occasions \u2014 welcomes, protects, promotes and integrates the most fragile, unprotected and vulnerable,\u201d Francis wrote.\nFrancis\u2019s letter comes as Vice President JD Vance has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/01/30/jd-vance-catholic-church-immigration/\" target=_blank>questioned</a> whether the Catholic Church\u2019s substantial, decades-long work with migrants is driven by a desire for money \u2014 criticism that has dismayed Catholic leaders.\nTrump and Francis have had back-and-forths dating back to Trump\u2019s first candidacy in 2016, when the pope said Trump was \u201cnot Christian\u201d for his plan to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The pontiff also called Trump\u2019s plan to mass deport migrants \u201ca disgrace\u201d the day before his 2025 inauguration."
