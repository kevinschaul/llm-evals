In 2022, Adam Frischnearly defeated Lauren Boebert. He lost by just 546 votes. That scared LaurenBoebert so much that she came running to my district. But the voters ofeastern Colorado don’t want a carpetbagging extremist more concerned withgetting on Fox News than the needs of her constituents. Even Republicans aredone with Boebert: 57% voted for someone else in the primary! We can finallykick Lauren Boebert out of Congress in November, but the only way I’ll be ableto win is if we hit every fundraising goal and have the resources to fullyfund my campaign. We’ve set a goal of raising another $250,000 before ourfinal end-of-month fundraising deadline, but right now, we’re still incrediblyshort. So I have to ask: Please, if you can afford to, will you make adonation to my campaign – every dollar you can spare – to help me defeatLauren Boebert?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Every dollar you give today will bring us one step closer to finally sendingLauren Boebert packing, and truly no amount you can afford is too small.

That’s why I am so excited about Trisha’s campaign: **New polling shows that Trisha can win and defeat Lauren Boebert! But Trisha can only flip this seat blue if she is able to raise enough money and fully fund her campaign.** I’m ready to help Trisha Calvarese take on Lauren Boebert and finally kick her out of Congress, and I am asking you to join me today: **Please, will you make a donation right now to Trisha Calvarese’s campaign to help her defeat Lauren Boebert this November? Winning this seat and turning it blue not only means getting rid of Boebert, but it will also get us one step closer to taking back the House for Democrats.** _Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  This election is about integrity and decency.

OKGOP,OKGOP,okgop@okgop.com,Day 3 of Early Voting is,11/1/24 0:10,2024,11,1,0,10,okgop.com,"Peter, Friday November 1st marks the 3rd day of early voting here in Oklahoma.So what are the three things you need to know? First of all, there just sohappen to be 3 judges of the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the ballot. And theyare ALL liberal. They are all THREE appointed by Democrat Governors. And wehave the chance to remove all three at once. If WE vote NO on all threeliberal Supreme Court judges, they will be removed and can no longer be ableto force their liberal agenda on Oklahoma. The question on your ballot will beif Edmonson, Gurich, & Kauger should be retained in their current positions.And the answer is NO, they should not be retained. All three must go, so wemust all VOTE NO! Secondly, you’ll be voting on several candidates beyond justthe President. We can all compare the economic boom with 4 years of PresidentTrump to the disastrous 4 years under Biden-Harris. If your mind isn’t alreadymade up on who to vote for as President think of how much better off you were4 years ago & realize we can have that again. There are other candidates onthe ballot, so the easiest way to vote is to choose “Republican” straightparty voting. That’ll make your selection for all those races & help put inRepublicans at the State & local level to help restore our economy & keep moremoney in your pockets. And third, you’ll also have two State Questions on yourballot. SQ833 creates new tax structures. Many people are torn on how to votefor this, but we’ll just put out there that we don’t believe the governmentneeds MORE ways to tax us. If you agree we don’t need more tax options, you’llvote no on this one. As for SQ834 it would clarify that ONLY citizens can votein Oklahoma elections. It’s obvious part of the Biden-Harris open border planis to get more people voting, including non-citizens. In fact a dozen citiesalready allow non-citizens to vote INCLUDING Washington DC! We must secure ourelections by allowing ONLY citizens to vote. Otherwise liberal court judges(refer to the first item listed above!) will allow law-breaking foreigners tovote in our elections. So there you have it, the three things you need toknow. 1) Vote no on all THREE Supreme Court judges. 2) Vote Republicanstraight party. 3) On the State Questions vote for lower taxes & ONLY citizensvoting. -Team OKGOP -=-=- Paid for by OKGOP and not authorized by anycandidate or candidate's committee. www.OKGOP.com - (405) 528-3501. 4031 N.Linconln Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK 73105 This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

Of course, “bad” is the understatement of the century.

Thank you, Nella Domenici Help Elect Nella and Secure the Border » ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

But first, I want to update you on everything that’s been happening. We’re only 5 days away from the election, and attacks from MAGA Republicans are non-stop — especially Donald Trump. Whenever Trump gets near a microphone, it’s almost a given that he’s going to attack me. At a MAGA rally in California, Trump threatened to withhold federal assistance for wildfires, attacked me personally, and urged his supporters to back GOP candidates across California. On Fox News, Trump rolled out a dangerous new attack, calling me the “enemy within,” claiming that I’m even more dangerous than foreign adversaries. He even threatened to use the military against me for holding him accountable. His goal is simple, Derek: sabotage my campaign and silence anyone standing in his way. It’s clear Trump and his allies still see me as a threat — and the closer we get to Election Day, the worse and more frequent the attacks will become.

Friends of Dave McCormick,Dave McCormick,info@conservativesdefendingfreedom.com,More lies from the Left,11/1/24 0:31,2024,11,1,0,31,conservativesdefendingfreedom.com,"Please read this full message Fellow Patriot, At West Point, we had a code:cadets don't lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do. First the New YorkTimes lied about my childhood and family, and now CNN is lying about mybusiness record. And what’s worse, they are doing it all because I’m withinstriking distance of an entrenched career politician, Bob Casey, in the #1swing state in the nation that will determine control of the U.S Senate. BobCasey is getting Leftist news sources to do his dirty work, and I WON’TTOLERATE IT. Here's the truth: this is a long message and I hope you will readall the way to the end. I grew up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. We lived oncampus at Bloomsburg State College and my parents owned a farm ten minutesdown the road. I had summer jobs baling hay and trimming Christmas trees atnearby farms. My dad started his career teaching history, economics, &democracy at Punxsutawney High. My mom began teaching fourth through sixthgraders at a public school near Pittsburgh. I’m incredibly proud that my dadwas chosen to be president of Bloomsburg State College (now BloomsburgUniversity) at only 34 years old. I’m so proud of my parents’ teachingcareers and to have been raised in Bloomsburg. It was there that I wrestledand played football and was nominated to the U.S. Military Academy at WestPoint. And it was there that I came home to a parade after serving in combatduring the Gulf War. After the Army, I earned a Ph.D. in internationalrelations before moving to Pittsburgh to start a career in business. I workedmy way up to become the CEO of FreeMarkets, a successful tech startup thatemployed hundreds in Western Pennsylvania. I was then called to serviceagain, this time in the highest levels of government as Under Secretary ofTreasury and as Deputy National Security Advisor. Following this, I joinedBridgewater Associates, one of the largest, most successful investment firmsin the world, which manages the pension plans of groups including teachers,firefighters and law enforcement. I have lived the American Dream, and I amrunning for Senate to bring my decades of experience and love for our countryto fix our broken economy that is a direct result of policies supported by myopponent, who has spent 18 years in Washington with NOTHING to show for it. Iknew getting into this race could mean things would get nasty, but it’s sad tosee we’ve fallen so far that these media outlets like the New York Times andCNN are pushing the Democrats’ baked narrative about my upbringing and mybusiness record. I’ve opened myself and my family up to attacks from theleft, and every day feels like a battle. But I’m no stranger to fighting forwhat is right andif we don’t elect leaders to go to DC to clean up the messthe career politicians made, we will lose America as we know it! Here’s whereI need your help, Fellow Patriot. We need to combat these lies with the TRUTHabout me. The Democrats are seeing the same polls you and I see. They know ifKamala Harris and Bob Casey lose Pennsylvania, they lose it ALL, and they aregoing to do WHATEVER IT TAKES to try and defeat me. I hate asking for money —I’m not a career politician, and it’s not in my nature — but I have no choicebut to ask if we’re going to hit our fundraising goal for the final stretch ofthe campaign.Will you chip in $30 or more right now to fight back against thelies from the Left? Chuck Schumer and his allies are working overtime toobliterate my campaign. They have committed to spend whatever it takes todefeat me.They know if I win this race in Pennsylvania, it’ll be IMPOSSIBLEfor Democrats to keep their majority in the Senate. If we don’t show theDemocrats we can win this race, it’s game over. That’s why I’m hoping you canspare$29, $50, or even $100 to help me fight back against the lies. DONATEYour donation will take us one step closer to victory, and I am so gratefulfor your support. Thank you, Dave McCormick P.S. Democrats from all over thecountry are pouring money into this race to defeat me because they know thisrace could flip the Senate red.Will you chip in $29 or more to make sure Ihave the resources to WIN?

I’m fired up, Peter! The energy at President Trump’s rally in Albuquerque today was palpable. I could feel it on stage while delivering my own remarks, and it was apparent to anyone who was there todaythat something special is happening in New Mexico. We’re on the cusp of flipping this state red and electing new leadership that will secure our border, lower our cost of living, get tough on crime, improve education, and unleash our abundant natural resources. I need you to keep fighting every single day, every single moment, until the polls close on Tuesday. Our campaign is working 24/7 to reach remaining undecided voters and get out the vote. We need to keep resources flowing into this campaign to ensure our funding for these operations doesn’t run dry. Your $5 or $10 contribution, in addition to your vote, is needed to help us secure more votes. Please chip in anything you can, and let’s win this thing! Let's Flip New Mexico RED! Thank you, Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Where every worker has the freedom to join a union.Where every person has affordable health care, child care, and paid leave.Where every senior can retire with dignity. But Donald Trump and his extremistRepublican allies want to take our country backward. They intend to cut SocialSecurity and Medicare, to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporationsand to make working families foot the bill, and end the Affordable Care Act.America has tried these failed policies before. We are not going back.Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, the batonis in our hands. To protect the right to vote. To get assault weapons off ofour streets. To restore reproductive freedom, reversing Donald Trump's extremeabortion bans. Jacky Rosen is running for reelection to continue deliveringfor Nevadans.

Here are a few numbers that reallystand out: 2.4%. That's the amount Arizona Senator Mark Kelly won his Senateseat by in 2020. 0.3%. That's Joe Biden's margin of victory over Donald Trumpin Arizona in 2020. 0.67%. That's the amount Kari Lake lost by in 2022 in theArizona gubernatorial race. $150 million. That's how much money is being spenton political TV ads during this campaign cycle in Arizona. The bottom line?Arizona is a state where elections are won by the narrowest of margins, andwith millions being spent against Ruben, this race will likely be nodifferent.

Gillibrand for Senate,Sen. Raphael Warnock,kg@kirstengillibrand.com,one of the most powerful allies you can have,11/1/24 1:05,2024,11,1,1,5,kirstengillibrand.com,"Look, if there's one thing that you should know about my friend Kirsten Gillibrand, it's that she never — never — backs down from a fight. But this year, Kirsten is facing an incredibly tough fight at the ballot box. Democrats are defending a massive 23 seats, meaning our grassroots resources are spread incredibly thin. And in 2022, New York saw the biggest red wave across the country. Now, those same extremists are working overtime to defeat Kirsten and retake control of the Senate. There's no way Kirsten backs down from this fight. But I also know exactly what it's going to take to win this election and defend our razor-thin Senate majority: Strong grassroots investments from people like you. That's why I'm personally asking — can you make a donation before midnight tonight to help my friend Kirsten defend her must-win seat and protect our Senate majority? Trust me, this is the only way that Kirsten will win. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_fr_defend-senate-2024?refcode=jtk5593-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 In everything that she does — every fight that she takes on, every piece of legislation that she supports, and every constituent that she advocates for — Kirsten is absolutely relentless. That's what makes her such an incredible advocate for Americans around the country (and one of the most powerful allies that you can have here in the Senate). Now, more than ever, New Yorkers, Democrats, and all Americans need Kirsten's bold voice in Congress. Because today, our most fundamental rights are under unprecedented attack from extremist Republicans. We're in a national emergency for our democracy and all of the values we hold dear. Kirsten and I are fighting every day to safeguard these rights. We're working to pass voting rights legislation that will ensure every single American has equal, unrestricted access to the ballot box. And we're rallying support to certify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would give us a legal basis to restore reproductive rights nationwide. But to continue these fights, and save our Senate majority, Kirsten needs your help: The only way to defeat the GOP's megadonors is with strong grassroots support from folks like you. So please, friend, if you have anything to spare today, will you rush a donation now to help Kirsten protect her seat so that we can continue to fight for your family in the Senate? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_fr_defend-senate-2024?refcode=jtk5593-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for all that you do, Sen.

There's a strong chance it will all come down to Ohio, which meansSherrod is the ONLY thing standing between us and a Republican Senate. Friend,I've worked on campaigns for a long time. I've been on the winning side andthe losing side. If there's one thing I know, it's that money makes a BIGdifference. I wish it weren't the case, but it is. TV ads, phone banks, yardsigns, campaign events in every corner of the state – it all adds up FAST.That's why I'm so terrified right now. If this were a simple battle betweengood and evil, I wouldn't be worried – Sherrod is as good a leader as Ohioanshave ever had. He fights harder for workers than anybody I know, and he's notafraid to take on the big banks and corporations that are making things harderfor the middle class. But money muddies the waters, and his opponent has got aton of it. He's poured A TON into his own campaign, and there's a lot morewhere that came from. Sherrod simply doesn't have that kind of money – sothat's where this grassroots team needs to come in and have his back, friend.I know Sherrod can win this critical race and keep the Senate blue, but ONLYIF we all come together to give him the resources he needs. So I'm asking:Will you rush $5, $25, or even $50 to help him win in Ohio and defend ourSenate majority? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?amounts=250,100,50,25,5&refcode;=jtk3725-fr-text Thanks for doingyour part – there's simply no other option if we want to save the Senate! –James Carville -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

And that says a lot. He doesn’t want to talk about his career-longcrusade to restrict reproductive freedoms like abortion, birth control, andIVF. He thinks it’s acceptable that he hasn’t brought back even one dollar ofcongressionally directed spending to Missouri.

Six days from rightnow, voters will decide the future of America. I'm looking at the early votetotals and I'll be completely upfront with you… I'm beyond worried. I'mpetrified. The Democrat voter turnout/ballot harvesting machine is chargingfull speed ahead to rob Donald Trump of the presidency, steal the House, andhold the line in the Senate. At this point, we could wake up on November 6thto a full Democrat takeover of America. That's why President Trump and I areworking hand in glove to save the country.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bI'm campaigning on stage with him. I'm traveling to swing states like Michiganto turn out voters. And I'm rallying Republican voters in Tennessee and beyondto win. The only problem is I'm about $80,000 short of my fundraising goalright now. I'm scared that if I don't make up the lost ground, I'll have toshut down our voter turnout operation for the final stretch of the election. Ididn't want to burden you with this but I'm out of options. I'm forced to cometo you - with my hat in hand - to plead with you for help.

DEMAND TERM LIMITS FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICES → [https://go.thinkbigamerica.com/a/loc_em_poll_20241101_term-limits_b1_f1_s1_c1_u2_rs-t0] We all know Trump packed the Supreme Court with the most far-right and dangerous justices imaginable - Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. These justices and their MAGA pals Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas have gutted the EPA, slashed voting rights, and overturned Roe v. Wade. This far-right majority doesn’t represent the values of the majority of Americans, so it’s past time we ensured the court wasn’t a cesspool of MAGA extremists. That’s why President Joe Biden’s plan to enact term limits for justices is so critical. Instead of having a MAGA majority for decades, we could at regular intervals nominate justices who aren’t Donald Trump’s hand-picked weirdos! This plan is incredible for democracy and reproductive rights, but it will need a groundswell of support if we are going to get it done. Will you sign our petition today demanding that Congress pass Joe Biden’s Supreme Court term limits plan? We need every single local Democrat to sign if we are going to have enough momentum to save our country from this extreme Supreme Court!

Thank you, Nella Domenici Help Elect Nella and Secure the Border » ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Right now, with just hours left until our final end-of-monthdeadline of the campaign, we’re just shy of hitting $30,000. Peter, I don’tthink I need to emphasize just how critical TX-15 is. This is the SOLEcompetitive House race in the state of Texas, and what we do here will definethe road to the House majority on November 5.

With exactly5 days left until the election, we can’t afford a single misstep or risk. Wehave to win this thing, folks — the future of Texas and democracy at largedepends on it. And if we’re going to make that happen, we need ALL theresources possible to supercharge our campaign.

The onlything left that Debbie needs to win is a sizable grassroots cash infusion overthe last 5 days — especially before her last $10 million end-of-month deadlinetonight.

And thanks to a generous group of donors, your contribution will be doubled too. Donors are matching gifts until our final end-of-month deadline tonight. This rare opportunity won’t last, so please don’t miss your chance to increase your impact. Click here to make a split donation of any amount—and have it matched—to help us win 2024’s most important race. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_tester?refcode=jtk5605-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 We’re not the only ones doubling down their efforts to win this race. Mitch McConnell’s allies are spending nearly $90 million to help my out-of-stater opponent win. They’re flooding the airwaves and trying to drown out our message. Experts rank Montana’s Senate race a toss-up—which means this race could go either way. And with recent polls locked in a tie, it’s anyone’s to win. Look, the sky won’t fall if you don’t chip in, and I’ll never trick you into donating. That’s not how I do things. But I will tell you the truth: We need to raise another $2,000,000 by midnight tonight and we’re falling behind. We need to work twice as hard to catch up and compete. Will you make a matched donation today and have it split? I’m counting on you to step up. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_tester?refcode=jtk5605-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 I appreciate your support.

Over the last few days, we’veheard ridiculous claims about President Trump being a “fascist.” Let me tellyou what fascism is… Fascism is weaponizing the legal system to punish yourpolitical opponents. Fascism is having your home taken from you. Fascism istaking the law license away from your opponent’s lawyer. Fascism is trying toturn your enemies into political prisoners. I am living through theDemocrats’ fascism right now. I sincerely pray that freedom, justice, and thetruth prevail on Tuesday, November 5 – or the damage done to me will spreadlike wildfire to the rest of our great Republic. But, as I wrote to you in anearlier letter, the Bible reminds us that our earthly possessions will alwaysfade, but greater “heavenly treasures” await us. The pursuit of truth,freedom, and justice are worth infinitely more than a car or a home.Possessions come and go, but I couldNEVER SURRENDER my fight for freedom andfor what I know to betrue.

Debbie for Florida,@Debbie,info@e.debbieforflorida.com,What $10 — and a box of doughnuts — means to me,11/1/24 11:06,2024,11,1,11,6,e.debbieforflorida.com,"Debbie Mucarsel-Powellhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text Friend, You probably didn’t wake up this morning and think, “Today's theday I’m going to make a $10 donation to DMP's campaign!” — but ahead of myLAST deadline of the Election, it's what I’m about to ask you to do. UnlikeRick Scott, I don't have a massive fortune at my campaign's disposal. I comefrom a working-class family, so I know my eye-watering $4 million goal isnothing to shake a stick at. But it's the only way I'll be able to defeat him.If that's all you need to hear, please click here to chip in $10 now — but I'dlike to share what your hard-earned $10 means to me.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text See, my family moved to the United States from Ecuador with big dreamsfor a better life when I was 14. But it didn't come easy, and despite my momworking back-to-back double shifts, we still struggled to afford rent on ourone room apartment. So once I turned 15, I began taking early morning shiftsat a doughnut shop before school. It wasn't much, but the extra cash gave myfamily room to breathe, and eventually, the life we dreamt of finally cametrue. But I'm not the only one who got their start in the doughnut business.When he was a young man, my opponent, Rick Scott, bought two doughnut shops.While I made minimum wage to help keep the lights on at home, he reaped thebenefits of his employees' hard work. For me, those $10 boxes of doughnutswere a lifeline that helped my family get by. For him, they kicked off acareer in penthouse C-suites. And with your $10, you can help me kick Rick outof the Senate on election night — so please, pitch in now.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text I went on to graduate college, fight to improve life for working familieslike my own, and become the first South American immigrant elected toCongress. Rick Scott went on to enrich himself off U.S. taxpayers via thelargest Medicare fraud scheme in history, amass a nine-figure fortune, and buyhis way into the Senate. So I don't take your help toward reaching my $4million goal lightly. There's simply no way I could ever do it on my own. Myopponent, however, can spend $4 million to get his ads on screens withoutthinking twice — and he has already spent plenty more to stop me. So the onlyway we'll get him out and give working Floridians the Senate representation wedeserve is if we hit my $4 million goal. Please, friend: Will you give just$10 — about the cost of a dozen doughnuts — to help me retire Rick Scott?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text This campaign is powered by small-dollar donations, so every cent makes abig difference.

Can I count on you to step up with a split donation of $10 today to ensure my team and I have the resources we need to push back against the $40 million worth of attack ads Ted Cruz and his allies are running against us right now? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Last time around, Ted Cruz won his race by just over 2% of the vote – that was a difference of about 215,000 votes, friend. I remember how it felt watching the results roll in on November 6, 2018, and let me tell you, it was a nail-biter. I have no doubts that this year will be when we finally send Ted Cruz packing. But despite being closer than ever to defeating Ted, we've still got a lot more work to do and only a handful of days left to do it. I know seeing a number like $500,000 can feel overwhelming, but if thousands of hardworking folks like you chip in $5 here, $25 there, and the occasional $100, we will be able to collectively reach this critical goal. So please, will you chip in a split donation between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's of $10 or whatever you can afford now so I can hit my daily fundraising goal and flip Texas blue? We've got zero time left to go, so let's get it done, friend! https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thanks for being on my team, Colin Allred -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

I just heardfrom my team that we missed last night's end-of-month fundraising goal, so weextended our deadline by 24 hours. We urgently need to close this budget gapor we'll be at a serious disadvantage – especially compared to our rich, self-funding MAGA opponent and the special interest money pouring into Ohio. Recentpolls show me down 1 point – so I'm reaching out to this grassroots team forhelp. This is urgent, friend: Will you please chip in $5 to help us reach oururgent fundraising goal, win here in Ohio, and save the Senate?

My team just let me know that we came up short of our October fundraising goal last night. This was always going to be an uphill battle. We had to raise our goals multiple times throughout the month to keep up with the tens of millions of dollars Republicans continue to spend on brutal attack ads against me. Now, I won’t tell you that the sky is falling because we missed this goal. But I will tell you the truth, which is that we’re starting November with a significant gap in our budget. That’s a problem because if we need to cut back on our campaign ads or get-out-the-vote efforts this late in the race, Republicans could easily flip this battleground seat. Staying competitive in this toss-up race isn’t as easy for me as tapping into a multimillion-dollar personal fortune like my opponent can. Instead, I rely on folks like you who pitch in what you can, when you can, to help power our campaign.

Bernie Moreno GOPNominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fights for theAmerican Dream because he’s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia. Atage five, his American Dream began when he moved to the United States with hisfamily. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentlesswork ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first cardealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groupsin America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformationalpotential of blockchain technology, before it received mainstream attention,and moved much of his volunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernieserved as Chairman of the Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie soldmost of his business to begin focusing on his calling: protecting the Americandream for another generation. Solving our country’s problems requires commonsense. In Washington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect ourfreedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, andalways put America First. Ohioans are done with politicians who talk a biggame and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. to get work done – just likehe always has.

We all know it. The only people who can afford to runfor Senate full-time are millionaires like my opponent, Republican DebFischer. That’s why they’re the only people who ever win. It’s why the Senateis just another country club full of Ivy League graduates, former businessexecs, and trust fund babies. Working people like me, we can’t afford to giveup our jobs to run for office. During this campaign, I’ve been working 40, 60,sometimes 90 hours a week as a steamfitter just to pay our bills and put foodon the table. How’s anybody with a real job supposed to campaign and win whenyour opponent is wealthy enough to not work at all? That’s why I announcedthat I was taking a leave from my job as a steamfitter to campaign full-timefor the U.S. Senate and keep up our momentum. And yes, that means I’m going toneed to take a salary from our campaign. Not a big one. Just enough to replacethe $48,000 I got paid last year and the cost of health care for me and myfamily. Politics shouldn’t only be for the rich, and this is the only way wecan change that. Five brand-new polls show me narrowly LEADING my opponent,Republican Deb Fischer – and according to FiveThirtyEight, this is now theCLOSEST Senate race in the country.

NowI’m known for making some pretty bold statements, but this is no exaggeration:Rick Scott is pushing an agenda so extreme, even Mitch McConnell wants nothingto do with it. I’m talking about ending Social Security and Medicare, raisingtaxes on working families, a national ban on abortions, and so much more. I’mscared half to death thinking about what could happen if we give this guy 6more years in Washington — especially with MAGA extremists on the cusp ofretaking the Senate. But right now, Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is fallingdangerously short of her LAST $4 million fundraising goal ahead of ElectionDay.

As folks from all across the state rally behindDebbie’s campaign, polling data shows that this race against extremist RickScott is a dead heat. And that barely scratches the surface: Even with theextreme abortion ban officially in effect, Florida Democrats secured areproductive rights ballot initiative this November and won a critical specialelection, flipping a pivotal state House district from red to blue. That’s whyDemocratic leaders like my friend Chuck Schumer, and even President Biden, areall in on Florida this year. They’ve announced HUGE investments to make surethat voters learn the truth about Rick Scott’s record. This state is ready toflip blue — but we’ve all got to have Debbie’s back in this fight. So I’masking one final time: PLEASE, will you donate $5 or as much as you can spareright now to make sure that Debbie has everything that she needs to take onRick Scott and defeat him?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2463-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for taking the time to read thisemail.

It would prevent physicians from performing abortions ifthere is a ""detectable fetal heartbeat,"" effectively banning abortions afterabout six weeks into pregnancy, before many people even know they arepregnant. ] We have said it before and we’ll say it again: MEN SHOULD NOT BEMAKING LAWS ABOUT WOMEN’S BODIES!

Through this experience, she has directlyengaged in the triumphs and challenges of our healthcare system and has seenthe ripple effect on people’s lives. “The exam room isn’t big enough to fitme, my patient, and Florida’s government.” This is why Rosemarie chose to runfor office.

Your unwavering support has made all of this possible — and now we’re just days away from the finish line.

Bernie became an American citizen at age 18.Through his relentless work ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, heturned the first car dealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of thelargest dealership groups in America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value andtransformational potential of blockchain technology, before it receivedmainstream attention, and moved much of his volunteer time and investmentdollars into the space. In 2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to bequite successful as Bernie served as Chairman of the Board. After a long,successful career, Bernie sold most of his business to begin focusing on hiscalling: protecting the American dream for another generation. Solving ourcountry’s problems requires common sense. In Washington, Bernie will fight toshrink government, protect our freedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party fromtaking our data and land, and always put America First.

We fight for these values every day.

So I wanted to take a few minutes to tell you about my decision to run for president – and why your support for the DLCC and my campaign is so important to our success on Election Day in four days. Before I continue, if you’re short on time, will you split a donation between the DLCC and my campaign at my personal link below? https://dlcc.org/dlcc-hfp **The truth is: I am no stranger to unlikely journeys.** Where I grew up in the Bay, you either live in the hills or the flatlands. We lived in the flats. It was a working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the civil rights movement, and at a young age I decided I wanted to be a lawyer. I wanted to protect people because I believe everyone has a right to safety, dignity, and justice. Today, my decision to run for president has everything to do with this opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past. We have the chance to chart a new way forward – not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans. I want you to know that I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens, who is realistic, practical, and has common sense. A president who always fights for the American people. I cannot do it alone. No one person could. It takes a team. It takes millions and millions of people coming together at once to shape the outcome of this election and elect Democrats up and down the ballot. If we are going to win this election and elect Democrats in swing districts across our country, I need you to step up and join this team. Millions of Americans have already voted, and millions more will vote on Election Day. And we need to do everything we can – and I mean everything – to reach every last voter to win the White House and elect Democrats to state legislatures across the country. **So, with time running out to make an impact before Election Day, I am asking for your support one last time:** Will you help us get out the vote over these final days by splitting $10, or whatever you can afford, between the DLCC and my campaign before our midnight deadline? Every dollar will help us reach more voters and elect Democrats in key swing districts before the polls close on Election Day. | If you've stored your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately and be split between DLCC PAC and the Harris-Walz campaign.  --- | $10 » --- | $25 » --- | $50 » --- | $100 » --- | $250 » --- | Other » ---  From the bottom of my heart: Thank you for everything.

Adam for Colorado,Adam Frisch,info@adamforcolorado.com,Fox News attacked my family,11/1/24 15:02,2024,11,1,15,2,adamforcolorado.com,"[http://adamforcolorado.com]http://adamforcolorado.com[http://adamforcolorado.com] Hello, The day before the anniversary of theSupreme Court’s disastrous Dobbs decision, I woke up to Fox News and LaurenBoebert attacking my sister and my 81-year-old father. For decades, Dad was anOB-GYN. He delivered thousands of babies and wrote books on how to getpregnant and to navigate menopause. Dad provided women with full access to allkinds of reproductive health care, including abortions, in the years rightafter Roe – and he has now had to watch as women’s reproductive rights aregutted in the aftermath of Dobbs . Dad and his clinic faced many threats overthe years. It’s no exaggeration to say that he put his own safety – and thatof his family – at risk in order to protect the rights of women to make theirown medical decisions. But I’m not sure he ever expected to see a sittingmember of Congress attacking him – or my sister who followed in his footsteps– in a national news outlet. It’s disgusting. These kinds of personal attacksagainst my family have no place in our politics and do nothing to serve thepeople of Western and Southern Colorado. If extremists like Lauren Boebert andmy new Republican opponent want to have a conversation about reproductiverights in this country, I am more than happy to have that debate. We can talkabout how I support freedom and liberty – and how they support big governmentintruding into the lives of women. We can talk about how they support anational ban on abortion – with no exceptions for rape, incest, or the life ofthe mother. And we can talk about how they are so extreme, they even want toban the pill that’s been used by women for decades. I am willing to talk allday about the fringe view that the government should be dictating women’smedical decisions. But what I won’t accept is extremists like Lauren Boebertand Fox News attacking my father and my sister. I am incredibly proud of myfather. He provided health care to women when they needed it during some ofthe happiest – and most devastating – moments of their lives. Beforeretirement, he would drive two hours to Planned Parenthood and help teach thenext generation of health care providers, like my sister. And no one – not FoxNews, and especially not extremists like Lauren Boebert or my new Republicanopponent – is going to stop my family from continuing to stand up for awoman’s right to choose. We already scared off Lauren Boebert. In 2022, I camejust 546 votes shy of winning this House seat. I’m ready to finish the job andreplace Boebert in Congress, but these are the kinds of ugly attacks that I’mup against. Please, if you can afford to, will you give $5 or more right nowto my campaign to help me win this critical House seat? Our race was theclosest in the entire country in 2022. But I’m not taking money from corporatePACs, so I’m counting on grassroots donors like you if I’m going to win.[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=10&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=25&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=35&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=50&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=100&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]I knew this campaign was going to get nasty, but I never expected the otherside to go after my family.

You might be asking yourself, “what can four quarters possibly do?” Well, here’s what your $1 can do: $1 can protect abortion rights, Social Security, and affordable health care from being dismantled by Tammy’s right-wing opponent. $1 can help defend our razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate from Republicans and their extremist agenda. $1 can help our campaign fight back against the $100 million worth of ads Republicans and right-wing super PACs have poured into Wisconsin — turning this into the most expensive Senate race in our state’s history. We get it — $1 may not seem like it could make a difference, especially up against Republican dark money donors and a self-funding megamillionaire who has poured $20 million of his personal fortune toward flipping this seat red. But this close to Election Day in the most competitive Senate race in the country, every single dollar makes a real difference — especially when tens of thousands of supporters step up to support Tammy’s reelection campaign.

Jason Miyares is theAttorney General of Virginia — but his story doesn’t start in Virginia… Itstarts in Havana, Cuba, when his mother, Miriam Miyares, fled communist Cubapenniless and homeless. She immigrated to Virginia and raised Jason toappreciate freedom, fairness, and justice for all. In 2015, almost fifty yearsto the day that she fled Cuba, Miriam was able to vote for Jason to representher in the Virginia House of Delegates. After working as a prosecutor andserving for three terms in the state legislature, he ran and was elected the48th Attorney General of Virginia. Since his inauguration in January 2022,Jason has been focused on fighting violent crime and improving public safety,strengthening economic growth, combatting the deadly impact of opioids andfentanyl, and protecting Virginians from corporate misconduct. He’s beenfearless in standing up for the rule of law by challenging the Biden-HarrisAdministration whenever it tries to use lawfare to advance its radical agenda,whether it’s failing to secure the border or advancing its extreme greenagenda.

But I never imagined five years ago that he would go this far. And it is certain to get worse if he wins.

As lead counsel for the Democrats during Trump’s first impeachment, I helped to expose Donald Trump and his lawlessness to the American people. We proved that a corrupt president had abused the power of his office to undermine our democratic process in a bid to stay in power. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dsg-em-nov24 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dsg-em-nov24] But that abuse of power was just the tip of the iceberg. Since then, Trump has attempted to overturn a lawful election in 2020, been indicted four times and convicted of 34 felony counts for interfering in the 2016 election, used his office to make money from foreign countries, cozied up to dictators, and tried everything in his power to undermine checks and balances and the separation of powers. But his plans for a second presidency are so much more dangerous. He has stated that he’d like to be a dictator, that he will use the military and the Department of Justice against anyone who disagrees with him, that he will turn the federal government into his personal fiefdom, that he will take away our individual rights and personal freedoms, and that he will support dictators over democracies around the world. Peter, we have unfinished business to save our country from Trump’s authoritarian intentions. Our democracy barely survived the first Trump presidency, and it’s unlikely it would survive a second. I’m running for re-election because we must stop Donald Trump and the Republican Party he controls from tearing down our democracy. And I need your support. Please contribute anything you can to support my work in the last four days of this election. We cannot waste a single second in this existential fight for American democracy.

It's true. When you respond to marketing emails and text messages from candidates, the candidates often get less than 20 percent of your donation after expenses. That's why the Senate Conservatives Fund was founded – to give freedom-loving Americans an effective way to support the best Senate candidates across the nation. Please contribute to these four candidates today! We will combine your donations with those made by thousands of other patriots and transfer them directly to their campaigns.

National Democratic Redistricting Committee,Team NDRC,info@democraticredistricting.com,A.G. Holder: “North Carolina is now one of the most egregiously gerrymandered states in the country.”,11/1/24 15:50,2024,11,1,15,50,democraticredistricting.com,"Peter, As Attorney General Eric Holder put it, North Carolina is “one of themost egregiously gerrymandered states in the country.” Let’s talk about how wegot here and how we’re fighting back right now — as we work to win a NorthCarolina election that’s flying under the national radar. In October of lastyear, Republicans in the state legislature manipulated the maps to gainunearned power. And state supreme court justices acted as ideologues insteadof neutral arbiters of the law — reversing the court’s own very recentprecedent and allowing those maps to move forward. Shockingly, the currentgerrymandered maps allow Republicans to hold supermajorities in thelegislature even if Democrats win statewide elections. And it’s important toremember that even if Democrats hold the governor’s seat this year, aRepublican supermajority in the legislature can override his veto. You’veprobably heard a lot about the governor’s race in North Carolina thiselection, even if you don’t live there. But here’s the critical North Carolinarace not enough people are talking about: A state supreme court candidate hasopenly said he wants a Republican majority on the court for the upcomingredistricting cycle. He praised North Carolina’s extreme congressionalgerrymander. And he joined a deeply controversial ruling that would haveestablished precedent for so-called personhood laws in North Carolina — thefoundation for restricting abortion and banning IVF. We are working to defeatcandidates like him in races across the country. Peter, step up with adonation to help ensure the NDRC can do everything we can between today andNovember 5th to elect Democracy Defenders in battleground states.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina] If you've saved your paymentinformation with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:Donate $5 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true&amount;=5]Donate $15 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true&amount;=15]Donate $30 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true&amount;=30]Donate $50 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true&amount;=50]Donate $100 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true&amount;=100]Another amount [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true] Theelection happening in just a few days will help shape the future of fair mapsfor North Carolinians.

Tina Smith for Minnesota,Team Tina,info@tinaforminnesota.com,Trump is not a “protector” of women,11/1/24 15:55,2024,11,1,15,55,tinaforminnesota.com,"Folks — Donald Trump and the GOP are absolutely fixated on controlling women’sbodies. From restricting abortion access to opposing in-vitro fertilization,it seems like Republican leaders think they know women’s bodies better thanwomen themselves. To that, Tina says: Mind your damn business. While Trumpclaims to be a “protector” of women, his policies and vicious rhetoric provethe opposite — he is standing in the way of women’s rights and freedoms.Tina’s had enough — that’s why she’s doing all she can to elect leaders whoare pro-women, like Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz. If youbelieve in candidates who will work to restore and expand women’s rights — notvote to take them away — pitch in to Tina’s work to elect Democrats up anddown the ballot over the final days of this election.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tsm-em-nov24] If you've saved your paymentinformation with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:CHIP IN $5 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tsm-em-nov24?express_lane=true&amount;=5&email;=dpwillis67@gmail.com] CHIP IN $10 NOW[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tsm-em-nov24?express_lane=true&amount;=10&email;=dpwillis67@gmail.com] CHIP IN $25NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tsm-em-nov24?express_lane=true&amount;=25&email;=dpwillis67@gmail.com] CHIP IN $50NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tsm-em-nov24?express_lane=true&amount;=50&email;=dpwillis67@gmail.com] CHIP IN $100NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tsm-em-nov24?express_lane=true&amount;=100&email;=dpwillis67@gmail.com] ANOTHERAMOUNT [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tsm-em-nov24?email=dpwillis67@gmail.com] Thank you! — Team Tina___________________________ Paid for by Tina Smith for Minnesota Tina Smithfor Minnesota PO Box 14362 St. Paul, MN 55114 United States unsubscribe:https://secure.ngpvan.com/p/waoR0e7lX0uLW5LEbBO87Q2?unsubscribedata=Q25M2gxb%2F%2F%2FUG8HdNk9sDGYlU33avaGeD0uh4%2FscaKKPNjLCDrVdcxwraNPnBJCYVCKnUaoONhvXHumUH5MoPMOqsSKB6mDJO4ULKQBZN21YRzPEiJmvkbWD6u%2F5195QZflzrBjj0srJXNF6GgMJprbLjqpOkKGjSJezSWsCClogyHDOf5ktglG7vybQsrDpIMJh%2B8EGb3xDLFb4M6INHJngTxrypiZklxpfIbiEMp6%2BYF6ykZVUQq%2FcGvhLAeAdYTzPvyH8%2BoVFonoX2zGknCnT%2BsNL3ORUOD0MY5Vkoym8CXQ1rKh%2FkmiDX8ZeI0fdHdE4NuJcqIjDusSM7C4mzuwVVfHgh2MreOCYJDNXh%2Fyws16gEbQDRMSjIFTShFN3ZqiNsPabSmVo4jFpSdnyy%2F7oXcSfUg5VeKbpenQPB8U%3DContributions or gifts to Tina Smith for Minnesota are not tax-deductible.Privacy Policy [https://tinaforminnesota.com/privacy/]",D,TRUE

Trump did not hold back. He directly attacked me onstage, saying I’m a “horrible person” and a “radical left lunatic.” And hegave my MAGA opponent a platform to lie about my record in front of thousandsof voters. Listen - I won’t let childish name-calling get under my skin.

I’m fired up, Peter! The energy at President Trump’s rally in Albuquerque today was palpable. I could feel it on stage while delivering my own remarks, and it was apparent to anyone who was there todaythat something special is happening in New Mexico. We’re on the cusp of flipping this state red and electing new leadership that will secure our border, lower our cost of living, get tough on crime, improve education, and unleash our abundant natural resources. I need you to keep fighting every single day, every single moment, until the polls close on Tuesday. Our campaign is working 24/7 to reach remaining undecided voters and get out the vote. We need to keep resources flowing into this campaign to ensure our funding for these operations doesn’t run dry. Your $5 or $10 contribution, in addition to your vote, is needed to help us secure more votes. Please chip in anything you can, and let’s win this thing! Let's Flip New Mexico RED! Thank you, Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

I’m so grateful to have the opportunity to talk about someone who will make meaningful change for everyday people like you. Take it from me, I understand the importance of having a people-powered campaign. Moreover, we’ve both come from humble beginnings. We know what it means to dig in deep to do the hard, meaningful work, and giving back to our communities is a value we both hold close to our hearts.

And with the Democratic Senate majority on the line in November, your grassroots support is crucial to making that a reality.

One of the most impactful votes you will castis on the THREE State Supreme Court judges on the ballot for retention. Thevoters in Oklahoma are being asked “should these judges be retained on theOklahoma Supreme Court?” And the answer is NO, they should not be retained!You’ve heard plenty about the Presidential Election, and voting straight partyRepublican will restore our economy, but we MUST get rid of these liberaljudges. All three judges are very liberal (check out the score card made byOCPA scoring their liberal records ) by clicking here , and they were allappointed by Democrat Governors. They’ve constantly legislated from the benchwith their decisions in order to force their liberal agenda on the people ofOklahoma. For more information on these judges & the other judges on theballot please visit OKGOP.com/judges/ . There you can download a pdf to printat home, email to your family & friends, or distribute however you choose.Other groups have now engaged as well encouraging their people to vote NO onthese judges. We can’t afford more years of liberal activist judges forcingtheir leftist agenda on our State. Tell everyone you know to VOTE NO on allthree Oklahoma Supreme Court judges.

When I first ran for Congress inWisconsin, no one thought I could win — especially when an extremely popularchallenger jumped into the race. I remember huddling with one of my staffersat the time, and she said, “Well Tammy, maybe you want to rethink what you’redoing because it’s going to be tough.” I looked her right in the eye andasked, “Do you think I should wait my turn?” The next thing I said was this: Ibelieve that women have to run — especially when it’s hard — and not wait ourturn. We can’t wait until we get a tap on our shoulder or we’ll never getanywhere. I ended up winning that race and became the very first woman electedto the House of Representatives from Wisconsin. And it wouldn’t be the lasttime our team would make history. When I ran for U.S. Senate in 2012, anincredible team of grassroots supporters like you fought alongside me — evenas some people wrote us off. You helped me become the first woman elected tothe chamber from our state and the first openly gay Senator in our nation’shistory. In 2018, despite being a top target for national Republicans andenduring over a year of attacks, you stood with me again, and we won. Time andagain, grassroots supporters like you have helped us defy the odds. The battleto protect my seat this year will be no different, with this race being mytoughest election yet. Eric Hovde and his Republican allies have already spentmore than $51 million to buy this seat and recent polls are showing this racein a dead heat. Protecting this seat won’t be easy, but together, I know wecan defy the odds once again.

Governor SaraRodriguez. I'm reaching out one last time before Election Day with one simplereminder: This is one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.Wisconsin is one of the most important swing states in the country. Our 10electoral votes are some of the most important in the country, and it'scrucial that we deliver them to Kamala Harris on Election Day. And at thestate level, we have a task that's just as important: flipping the statelegislature. The new, fairer maps for this cycle give everyone the chance towin, which makes this the first time in a long time that we can win a majoritythis November. When we win next Tuesday, it'll let Governor Evers and I focuson passing our agenda that truly serves the people of Wisconsin rather thanfighting back against Republican attempts to bully working-classWisconsinites. With just a few days left in this election cycle, it's moreimportant than ever to make your voice heard at the ballot box. Whether thatmeans voting early or voting on Election Day, the most important thing is thatyou vote. I'll be doing my part this weekend, knocking on as many doors as Ican with my team—can you chip in to help us cover the expenses for this lastbig GOTV push?

Only 4 House seats standbetween Republicans or Democrats taking back the House. So winning in this keybattleground race puts us on the best track to winning back the House. But weneed to get out Chris’s message and turn out voters before and on ElectionDay. Republicans are attacking Chris’s record, but they’re the ones with theagenda Western PA doesn’t want. Chris’s opponent supports an extreme,nationwide abortion ban, has rallied with election deniers, has voted to gutvoting rights, and wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the choppingblock. The American people don’t want this kind of lunacy, chaos, andextremism. That’s why we’ve got to do everything we can to keep this seat soChris can continue fighting to defend our freedoms. But if we’re going to beatthese extremists on Tuesday, we need to hit the ground running this weekend,and we need the money to make it happen.

It’s full of millionaires, formerbusiness execs, lawyers with Ivy League degrees, and trust fund kids born withso many silver spoons in their mouths that they have no idea the reality forworking-class people like me. If I defeat my opponent Republican Senator DebFischer in November, I will be the poorest member of the U.S. Senate. I don’tcome from money, and I’m not rich. I’m a steamfitter and mechanic who works 50and 60 hour weeks to give my kids a better life. I will be the only senatorwithout a college degree. After my wife and I found out we were expecting ababy, I had to drop out and kill my dream of hanging a diploma on the wallbecause my family needed health insurance, diapers, and food on the table. Iwill be the only senator who is a blue-collar, card-carrying, union member.When Kellogg’s tried to cut our benefits and workers’ pay, we risked it all,went on strike, and walked the picket line for 11 weeks through the bittercold Nebraska winter. We won and saved hundreds of good-paying jobs – before Iwas fired for being the union president who led the strike. There is no onewho represents working-class people like me in the U.S. Senate. Which is whythis is such big news: Five brand-new polls show I am narrowly LEADING myopponent Republican Senator Deb Fischer. And FiveThirtyEight now says this isthe CLOSEST Senate race in the entire country! I’ve taken on a big corporationbefore and won, and now I’m going to defeat one of the most corporate senators– my opponent Republican Deb Fischer – and win this Senate seat. But I needyour help to do it. We’ve set a goal of raising another $200,000 before ournext fundraising deadline at midnight tonight, but I’m not taking money fromcorporate PACs like my opponent.

Look at the Groundbreaking last weekfor I-95 Photo- Tyler Fedor Source [ http://Tyler Fedor/The Stamford Advocate] Yonkers Contracting is based in New York. As an advocate for you, I reachedout to the press - so far, no response from the media. We are glad there aresome infrastructure improvements and most of the funds are federal but shouldwe also look to use Connecticut companies and keep more of the money in ourstate. After all they are federal tax dollars from CT residents as Connecticutonly gets back 70 cents of every federal dollar spent. A vote for me is a votefor transparency.

We see these truckseverywhere every night along the campaign trail when the roads are beingworked on for improvements. The concerns they raise are seeing New YorkLicense plates and why these are not Connecticut trucks. Have you looked into:How are these contracts awarded? If an out-of-state contractor is hired, willit use Connecticut Union Construction workers and other ancillary Connecticutresidents to participate in the construction or are all these workers New Yorkas well? If an out-of-state contractor is hired, will it use local suppliersof various materials or are all these suppliers New York as well? Whether allcontracts are awarded to the lowest bidder? Are local contractors consideredif their bid is slightly higher? How is a contractor rewarded or penalized byits previous project for change order usage as the winners always seem to bethe same? The percentage of payrolls to Connecticut residents (if any)? Thebenefit to local communities and economies in Connecticut if a localcontractor is awarded the contract? The benefits of contractor profits beingre-invested into the local economy rather than exporting profits outside of CTfor the out-of-state contractor and its out-of-state suppliers? AdditionalFees such as fuel surcharges and other distance based issues on logistics? AsClimate Change and Health Hazards associated with slow-moving traffic are alsomajor concerns, are the following also included in the calculation: Theenvironmental impact of greenhouse gas based on travel distance of workers andequipment out of state to the project site? The additional congestion of theworkforce commuting to the construction site and how it will disrupt trafficfor commuters? We have been concerned about the I-95 traffic and thechallenges to the Fairfield County corridor and now a project is starting. Wesaw the Yonkers Contracting banner and also wondered why there are noConnecticut Companies that win these bids. While most of the highway funds arefrom the Federal Government, it is still Connecticut taxpayer funds as CT hastraditionally received only 70 cents back on each federal dollar. As acandidate for Congress in Connecticut and campaigning on improving theFairfield County corridor, it is not just about improving the roads, buthaving a lasting impact on the local economies of Fairfield County andsurrounding counties that keep federally spent dollars in Connecticut.

We wouldappreciate your prompt attention to this matter as this is a major concern forour Voters. Traffic, Infrastructure, Climate Change and Health are on theBallot and the voter should be informed. Connecticut has also some of thehighest costs per mile for road repair and construction and our constituentsare concerned about inefficient use of taxpayer funds at the state and locallevel as poor spending hurts each resident in the pocketbook. We arethoroughly concerned about these issues. Sincerely, Dr. Michael T.

Just four more days to put our noses to the grindstone, turn out voters, and advocate for candidates that will put the needs of the many above the needs of the few. There are TONS of ways to get plugged in and help. Here’s what we need you to do:  1. Join one of our final phonebanks for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz — either tonight (Friday) at 6pm ET or tomorrow (Saturday) from 11am - 1:30pm ET.   2. If you want to focus specifically on Pennsylvania — one of the most critical swing states this cycle — join our PA WFP phonebank here. We’ll be hitting the phone lines on Sunday and Monday.   3. If you live in a swing state or are willing to travel to one, sign up to join a door knocking shift in key battlegrounds. Our partner, Seed the Vote, can help book transportation and housing, and offer financial support for those who need it in order to travel.   4. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, you can easily find ALL the volunteer opportunities nearby (if they exist) by **texting ""WIN"" to 30403**You all have already done SO MUCH for our movement this cycle, Peter. Allwe’re asking for is one BIG push over these final four days. In solidarity,Team WFP P.S.

RUSH ACONTRIBUTION (https://secure.actblue.com/donate/blu-amdc-24q4-em?refcode=BLU_EM_AMDC_2024-11-01_2&amount;=25) This is not the newswe wanted, Peter — Our race was just downgraded by the Cook Political Report,meaning it got a lot more competitive. And with polls putting this race withinthe margin of error, what we do now could make or break the outcome. With just4 days left, that means meeting voters across the district to lay out thestakes. A Neil Parrott victory could mean: ❌Another vote against reproductiverights. ❌A vote against protections for victims of domestic violence andsexual assault. ❌And if Republicans don’t like the outcome of the Presidentialelection, it could mean a vote for decertifying the results. We need yoursupport now more than ever to finish this race strong. Will you chip in $10,$25, or whatever you can right now?

With the stakes this high, we can’t leave any stoneunturned. The good news is that there’s still time for these crucial voters todeliver their mail-in ballots in person before polls close. But if we don’thave the resources to fuel this final GOTV push across Florida, thousands ofDemocratic ballots could be left on kitchen counters – that’s exactly what thefar-right is hoping for.

Be assured this is not another generic political message. I amwriting today because I will never stop using my God-given platform toproclaim proudly that: CHRIST IS KING! HELP MOBILIZE CHRISTIANS Our nationis at a crossroads in many ways. Powerful forces are doing all they can tosubjugate Christ’s authority on earth. A legion of souls have turned away fromGod, which has had a negative impact on so many important issues. One of themost glaring examples is the attack on the unborn. If it wasn’t already clear,I have said that “I will NEVER back down from my pro-life stance.” I do notwant to take much time or energy today focusing on the negative, but insteadpoint to Jesus Christ and how we should navigate these turbulent times. That’swhy I started the UPRIGHT PAC—to mobilize Christians across America. Not justfor the upcoming election, but for many elections to come. When united, wehave a powerful voice, and our votes can make a difference. Our country needspeople of faith to stand up and take action. The other side is workingovertime to push an ANTI-faith, ANTI-family agenda, but I believe we can turnthe tide. This is our moment. Let’s show the world the power we have when weare united.

Democrats are raising and spending millions morethan us, but we have a better message. Kamala Harris has done NOTHING tosecure our border as Vice President. Donald Trump and a Republican Senate willBUILD THE WALL. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were responsible for ourdisastrous Afghanistan withdrawal.Republican candidates like Tim Sheehy, SamBrown, and Dave McCormick actually have SERVED overseas. Kamala Harris andSenate Democrats want to PACK our courts with liberal judges.

Lawson-Remer haseven admitted that her representatives haven’t attended meetings(https://www.nbcsandiego.com/decision-2024/san-diego-county-district-3-supervisor-race-2024/3660810/) , leaving important issuesunaddressed. In any other job, failing to attend mandatory meetings would begrounds for termination. But when it comes to serving our communities, sheexpects a pass? San Diego deserves a leader who is accountable, dedicated and,most importantly, present. I understand the urgency of San Diego’shomelessness crisis and have a track record of hands-on leadership, provensolutions, and a transparent commitment to our community. I won’t sit on thesidelines or turn a blind eye to the issues that affect us all just to collecta paycheck. Let’s work to address the pressing challenges we face as acounty—together.

Out on the campaign trail, I’ve spoken with people all across the country who are fired up to elect a president who gets us — one who understands the challenges that working people face and will fight like hell to address them. I’ve also spoken to people who are anxious about what lies ahead. I get it. The stakes of this election are incredibly high, and it’s normal to feel worried about what the future holds. But as we enter the final weekend before Election Day, we must channel our anxiety into action. We have just four days left to do the work that needs to be done to win Michigan and the White House for Vice President Kamala Harris, so let’s get to work! This weekend is our LAST chance to reach and turn out voters for Vice President Kamala Harris on the scale we need to win this election.

When my boys were young, my husband and I were both workingfull-time. As soon as I got off the night shift from the Chapel Hill PoliceDepartment at 7am, I would go straight to my sons’ classrooms to volunteer.Not only did this serve as an opportunity for me to spend more precious timewith my children, but it opened my eyes to the social disparities affectingstudents firsthand, especially Black and brown kids, in the classroom. Icouldn’t stand by as students were being underserved, so after doingeverything I could do as a volunteer — I ran for School Board. On the SchoolBoard, I fought tooth and nail for better funding for our schools. Buteventually, I knew I had to run for Orange County Commissioner to makeconcrete changes. As Orange County Commissioner, I championed the constructionof two schools, two senior centers, and affordable housing initiatives — butknew the next step to securing long-term progress for our children’s andcommunities’ future was running for State House. I championed legislation forwomen, voting rights, and environmental protection. But, when I could donothing more as State Senator, I ran for Congress. I got into this line ofwork in pursuit of building a better life for my community and followed myheart throughout every single step. Now, there’s still SO much more I can do.In just 4 days, you can send me back to Congress and keep building progressfor NC-04. If you’re with me in this fight, will you chip in $ or more rightnow to get out the vote and defend my seat?[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vf-em-fr-nov24?amount=] If you've storedyour payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process now.DONATE $ » [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vf-em-fr-nov24?amount=&express;_lane=true] DONATE $ »[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vf-em-fr-nov24?amount=&express;_lane=true]DONATE $ » [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vf-em-fr-nov24?amount=&express;_lane=true] DONATE $ »[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vf-em-fr-nov24?amount=&express;_lane=true]DONATE $ » [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vf-em-fr-nov24?amount=&express;_lane=true] OTHER AMOUNT »[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vf-em-fr-nov24] I’m so grateful to have youalongside me on this journey, Peter. — Valerie[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vf-em-fr-FOOTER24] CONTRIBUTE »[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vf-em-fr-FOOTER24] Paid for by Foushee forCongress Valerie Foushee for Congress PO Box 16446 Chapel Hill, NC 27516United States If you would like to unsubscribe, click here[https://secure.ngpvan.com/p/9_07fM1dnEmqdVR1wv8kcQ2?unsubscribedata=G%2B%2FTOuJy3Ah8dMgfR4uPZ1lCqxGJE%2Fu0b6Wr9HEkMhcGL2h2ByJmHEUxfHEhrW%2FF%2FuHA0M%2FN9%2BcjhuhXUNn7O91604kcqYJGVq7z2iypDvm2FOSHuV9JW3ZCE0Ww%2BUEjm1BerugE7cysptSlZu0cN3LPRNNlsqSG6LgM3ZXn1i5Wi2mx9HtTjg0rdZ3iFdH1%2FFcz4fhAxR80dBzTe9fqa1vZ6bz2KP16ezuEQSmnUVjvWHf4HvH9%2B3Gsoi5HfH20P3ys%2F2OuH5zR2tbGSqUNSZIzHHDlP%2FOhgdCpbrwSCrC7uUEcFwGA4zqaC0aYWXZINtmxqpCRoI8acBIe7gQNtkEoWCFoFloaQjgoUOfC3a3I79ykco9brCQhKTudu8QX9LZhFmsrdSC1594mzJ5Jz45r%2F9kiRtFDTGzRqXE%2BA1E%3D]You can also click here to donate [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vf-em-fr-FOOTER24] .",D,TRUE

Nella for Senate,Nella Domenici,info@justandfreegop.com,Schumer now buying NM,11/1/24 19:33,2024,11,1,19,33,justandfreegop.com,"Nella for Senate They’re funneling out-of-state dollars into New Mexico to buy up precious advertising time during the final weeks and days before Election Day. Friend. Chuck Schumer and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are now jumping into this race to rescue endangered career politician Martin Heinrich. They’re funneling out-of-state dollars into New Mexico to buy up precious advertising time during the final weeks and days before Election Day. They know they were completely caught off guard when I entered this race and have been watching nervously as we’ve gradually caught up to Heinrich in the polls. Now, they can’t stand to sit by any longer and are frantically trying to stop our upward momentum. With New Mexico being one of the smallest states and cheapest media markets in the 2024 fight for the Senate, the money they’ve raised from West and East Coast liberal elites stretches much further here,which means they can do A LOT more damage with much less. But that also means your support goes much further here, and I’m asking you to help rebalance the scales and prevent Schumer and his deep-pocketed allies from buying this election at the last minute. We’ve never been so close to flipping a “safe blue” state, and I need every bit of support you can send down the home stretch. Whether it’s $5 or $500, every dollar donated at this point in the campaign helps us reach and win over undecided voters in this race. Let’s keep up the fight! Nella Domenici Republican for Senate ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

TAMMY BALDWIN FOR SENATE,Tammy Baldwin,info@e.tammybaldwin.com,Sacrifices.,11/1/24 19:33,2024,11,1,19,33,e.tammybaldwin.com,"[ https://act.tammybaldwin.com/go/67?t=1001&akid;=4435%2E35263%2EbzyJWt ]TAMMY BALDWIN FOR SENATE Peter, I have a personal story I’d like to share with you. Growing up, I was diagnosed with a serious illness and spent three months in the hospital. When I got better, my grandparents, who raised me, wanted to make sure I was protected in case I got sick again. But they couldn’t find any insurance policies that would cover me in the future. Not from any insurer. Not at any price. That meant my grandparents had to pay for my health care out of pocket, and they had to make significant sacrifices to do so — all because I had a pre-existing condition. I saw my grandparents stay up late at night, worried that I might fall ill again and that they wouldn't be able to afford my care. No one should ever have to go through that. But my story is not unique, Peter, and I knew they weren’t the only ones. That’s why I got into public service. I’m one of 133 million Americans who have the label ""pre-existing condition"" attached to our care — and before the Affordable Care Act was passed, many of us could be denied coverage. Now, insurance companies can no longer discriminate against someone based on their pre-existing condition. I championed health reform and wrote the amendment to allow young people to stay on their parent’s insurance plan up to age 26. And when I meet with young people across Wisconsin, almost every hand in the room goes up when I ask who is on their parent’s health insurance. So, you can imagine my frustration whenever Republicans attack our health care and threaten protections for folks with pre-existing conditions — including my opponent Eric Hovde, who called my amendment a “stupid idea” and said young people on their parent’s health insurance need to “grow up and move on.” If Eric Hovde flips this seat and secures the Senate majority for Republicans, the ACA will be on the chopping block and countless Americans could find themselves in a place where insurance companies are putting profits over people. That’s not right. And that’s why I need your help to defeat him.

She's a leader of our MAGAmovement. She's a tough-as-nails Conservative. And she's a wall standing inthe way of the Democrats' radical agenda. She's also up for re-election inNovember. Normally, she would soar through the finish line since she's a topally of President Trump… but unfortunately, we have a problem. Chuck Schumerrecruited a power-hungry, showboating socialist in a desperate attempt todestroy any opposition to his agenda and defeat Marsha. In fact, Marsha'sopponent just joined forces with Hollywood elite types to turbocharge hernegative campaign to flip Tennessee. Let me say this in no uncertain terms: Ifthis radical socialist manages to flip Tennessee, our path to winning back theSenate Majority will COMPLETELY VANISH.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97So, with all that being said, I respectfully ask you for the FIRST TIME todonate right now to Marsha Blackburn's re-election campaign.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97PLEASE JOIN ME: DONATE NOW I don't send these types of emails very often. Ifyou're like me, these types of political emails kind of drive you crazy. Butthis is no ordinary request. Marsha Blackburn is exactly the kind of strong,patriotic conservative President Trump needs in the U.S. Senate. No surprisehere, but Marsha's socialist opponent turned to big liberal names to helpbankroll her campaign. Luckily, we have you on our side. If just 30% respondto my email, Marsha's socialist opponent will have no shot at EVER flippingthis key Senate seat. But first, I need your help right now. Please. I'mpersonally asking for your help.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97So, I hope that's enough to convince you.

But that’snot even why I’m reaching out right now – because before then, I have anotherdeadline I’m worried about. In just a few hours I’m hoping to wire some moremoney to re-up our TV ad buys and get Kristin’s message in front of hundredsof thousands of voters before Election Day on Tuesday. I need to ask you tochip in $ to help us out https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kl-email-241101-ads?amount=&refcode;=KL_ATA_EM_FR_Ads_241101_T1_2, but I wantedto take just a second to explain why and what’s at stake. If your experienceis anything like mine, right now your TV, your phone, everything you’ve got isbeing flooded with ads about the upcoming election. That’s because these adswork – and especially in races like ours, they can make all the difference. Weknow that the elections this year are going to be incredibly close. Thepresidential election and the House alike are neck and neck, and just a fewvotes could be the difference between sending Kristin to Congress to fight forour rights as the first pro-choice OB/GYN to serve, and watching Tony Wied getsworn in in January to help put money in the pockets of his wealthy friends.These final days are a crucial opportunity for us to reach people where theyare – at their homes, on their phones, at work, and everywhere in between –and remind them to get out and vote for Kristin on Tuesday. So I urgently needyour help to make sure I can place this ad buy today.

Buthe’s already dropped $2.5 million of his personal wealth to defeat me, andthis race is too close for comfort. Election Day is almost here, and I needyour help to fight back against his attacks.

Onthe ground this past month, I met people who are fired up and ready to electleaders who are prepared to use every power available to address the climatecrisis. Every state brought unforgettable moments, each one a reminder thatour future is worth fighting for. In Washington State, I joined volunteersfighting a Big Oil-backed initiative that could strip away crucialenvironmental protections. In the battleground state of Arizona, I went door-to-door to support candidates for local office and reminded folks what’s atstake if Donald Trump and his allies down-ballot win. And in Michigan, Italked to voters face-to-face and shared a hug with a woman who answered thedoor with tears in her eyes. We talked about why this election matters sodeeply, and it reminded me exactly why I’m in this fight. The hope and energyout there are real, and it’s kept me going through this whirlwind electionseason. YOU have kept me going. As a small way of saying thank you, I’d liketo send a couple of signed postcards from my journey after Election Day.

They were racist,insulting, and entirely unacceptable. Ya no mas. Any person or party whoespouses this kind of vile rhetoric against other humans — let alone citizensof the United States — is unfit to run the White House. And anyone who wouldtie themselves so closely to a candidate who does, like Rick Scott, has nobusiness in any position of power — especially in Florida. Please split $15 ormore between Blue Amp Action now to help me reach my $10 million end-of-monthgoal and build the resources to retire him from the Senate. --- | | DONATE → --- | And what's more, Peter, is that they know full-well that what they're doingis wrong — and they're terrified of facing the consequences. How am I so sure?Well, when I went to vote yesterday, I had the displeasure of running intoRick Scott myself, as he rallied Miami Republicans in a misguided attempt totry and intimidate me for social media clicks. As soon as he saw me there, hesped off in his chauffeured getaway car. Disappointing? Yes. Surprising?Hardly. It's just who he, Donald Trump, and the GOP are: Bigots, cowards, andlosers. First, Rick took a note out of Trump's playbook when he refused todebate me. Then, he comes to my home district and doesn't even have thecourage to face me, not to mention answer for his puppet-master's despicableattitudes. Now, he's panicking, and desperately trying to placate Florida'slarge Puerto Rican population, whose votes he's courting to win and stay inpower. The best way he could earn our forgiveness now is by leaving my peoplein peace, starting by staying out of politics entirely. Sadly, cowards likehim don't have the decency to do the right thing and leave us be. But with themassive fortune he used to buy the 2018 election, he won't leave without agroundswell of Florida voters saying ya no mas, too. And with just 4 days leftin this race, I won't galvanize the movement to unseat him if I can't make mycrucial $10 million goal by midnight on Thursday. In short, I can't bring himto account at the ballot box on Election Day without your grassroots support,tonight. Will you please rush $15, or anything you can spare to split withBlue Amp Action and help me flip Florida blue, retire Rick Scott, and stop theGOP's hatred from getting ahold of the Senate majority? --- | | DONATE → --- | --- | | | Let's get this done.

Now we stand at the brink of an even more transformative moment.It’s not just a political milestone. It's a testament to the journey ofgenerations of people who have worked, dreamed, and persevered to get us tothis moment. Our community's story is one of resilience — of voices thatrefuse to be dimmed and of traditions that continue to shine brightly acrosscontinents. We see this in the vibrant celebrations happening in homes andcommunities across the nation. In the glow of clay lamps, in the warmth ofshared meals, in the sparkle of joy that connects us. To our diverse SouthAsian community — Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains — this is a momentto honor our collective strength. To recognize the challenges we face, thefears that sometimes shadow our experiences, and also the power we have touplift, to support, and to create meaningful change.

The family down the road maynot think, pray, or love like you, but they are your neighbors and you lookout for them. Now we know that Donald Trump, JD Vance, and MAGA Republicanshave a different vision of America. When they talk about freedom they mean thegovernment should have the freedom to invade every corner of our life. Take itfrom a small-town guy: they know nothing about what working people need.That's not what we do in Minnesota. We don’t attack our neighbors’ rights. Wewelcome everyone in, and we lift each other up. My friend Tina Smithunderstands this. And she works hard every day to ensure Minnesotans’ voicesare heard in the United States Senate. That’s what this campaign is about:working together to build a future where everyone has the opportunity not justto get by, but to get ahead. Where workers come first, health care and housingare human rights, and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom. Butwe need you in this fight with us. Will you split a donation of $10, orwhatever works for you right now, between Tina Smith and our campaign so wecan continue working together and defend our values up and down the ballot inNovember?

Gillibrand for Senate,Debbie Mucarsel-Powell,kg@kirstengillibrand.com,"yes, it really is *that bad*",11/1/24 21:05,2024,11,1,21,5,kirstengillibrand.com,"I barely slept a wink last night, friend. Yesterday evening, my finance director called me up for an emergency meeting — and yes, the news really was *that bad*: We fell short of our $10 MILLION end-of-October goal. The only way we change that is by raising $894,208 over the next two days — and since voters head to the polls in just four days, closing that gap is non-negotiable. Will you please split $10 or more now between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's to ensure I have the resources to flip Florida blue? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5613-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 With the Democrats' razor-thin Senate majority at stake, NBC News and The Washington Post both confirm that all eyes really are on my race to flip Florida blue. And thanks to your support so far, I've steadily chipped away at Rick Scott's dwindling lead, to the point where polls show this race is statistically TIED. But Rick Scott and his corporate special interests have realized they can no longer take this race for granted. Now that they're scared, they're outspending us nearly 3-to-1 on MASSIVE ad buys attacking me across the Florida airwaves. So we have to fight back against this sudden swell of pro-Scott spending and ensure our people-powered message reaches as many voters as possible in this final stretch to Election Day. Rick Scott can tap his massive personal fortune to pull out all the stops in Florida's insanely expensive media market. But unlike him, I'm running a people-powered campaign — and according to my finance director, we won't have the funds to fight back without a SURGE of grassroots support tonight to make up the projected shortfall. Now more than ever, friend, I need your help: Will you please split $10, $25, or anything you can spare right now between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's? I can't get back on track to retire Rick Scott and keep the Senate majority blue without you. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5613-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 I'm so grateful I can count on supporters like you — thank you.

I am now one point behind Rick Scott—we canwin this race, but I need everyone. And then, what political pundits wouldhave thought impossible only a year ago happened: A poll showed us just asingle point behind Rick Scott, and Democratic leadership — the DSCC and theDNC — rushed investments into Florida to help us pull ahead and win! But RickScott is doing what Rick Scott always does: spending from his own fraudulentlymade fortune to cling to power. He's so terrified by our momentum that hedropped a staggering $10 MILLION on TV ads against me. $10 million at the dropof a hat, friend. In the final days of this race, it's never been more clearthat we can win in Florida and pull off one of the greatest political upsetsof all time. But it's this grassroots movement — including you, friend —against Rick Scott's millions. That's why I'm counting on you and the rest ofthis team to help me raise $4 MILLION before my LAST fundraising deadlineahead of Election Day. Please rush a donation of $5, or whatever you canspare, right now to help me fight back against Rick Scott's attack ads, win inFlorida, and protect our Democratic Senate majority!

The Bolick Brigade has put in the time and we know ourhard work is paying off because our targeted voters are returning their earlymail-in ballots. We have been stopping by voter's houses, making phone callsand texting them to return their ballots. In the process, we have beenreminding early voters to take their mail-in ballots to the closest openvoting center or to simply vote in-person between now and Election Day becausethe deadline has passed ensuring timely delivery of early ballot back to thecounty in time to be processed. If you still have an early mail-in ballot youwould like to return, you can still drop it off at an open voting center orplace it inside the nearest drop box. Today, is the last official day of earlyvoting. Under state law, if you need to cast a ballot after today and beforeElection Day, the county has designated a few emergency voting locations(https://elections.maricopa.gov/voting/where-to-vote.html?mc_cid=9193bbd4cb&mc;_eid=UNIQID) on November 2nd and 4th betweenthe hours of 9am and 5pm.

If you vote in-person youshould have received a lengthy sample ballot last week. I received my sampleballot last Wednesday in the mail and then I voted early in-person at ASU-Westthe following day. I tracked my ballot. It took two days for Maricopa Countyto receive my ballot and earlier this morning my signature was finallyverified and my ballot was counted. In Maricopa County, the tabulation centeris understaffed by several hundred during early voting according to a localnews report. Maricopa County's ballot processing is working in 24-hour shiftsto get everything tabulated, working around the clock 24/7 due to heavyturnout.

Voter Protection Project,Jon Tester,info@e.protectvoting.org,Brand new poll,11/1/24 21:12,2024,11,1,21,12,e.protectvoting.org,"Can I tell you a story about my family farm, folks?(https://act.protectvoting.org/go/83568?t=1002&akid;=17874%2E878179%2ERFLm4a)In 1910, my grandfather came to Montana. He found a piece of grassy land, tooka look at it, and said, “This is the place.” And that’s where the farm began.He farmed the land until the early 1940s, and then passed it down to my folks.In 1978, my wife Sharla and I took over the farm and we’re still here today,three generations and more than 40 years later. We’ve made a lot of progresshere — Sharla and I built a new home, several steel buildings, and morestorage. The truth is, I love this work. Yes, it makes for early mornings andlate nights during planting and harvest seasons — but it also keeps megrounded, and it gives me perspective on the issues we face every day. When Ithink about climate change, I’m thinking of folks on farms like mine,struggling with catastrophic droughts or historic levels of flooding. When Ithink about reforming the USPS, I’m thinking of the people in ruralcommunities across Montana who rely on timely mail delivery for theirmedication or Social Security checks. And when I think about infrastructure,I’m thinking of the rural towns near mine that need access to affordable,high-speed internet. These aren’t abstract issues or talking points. They’revery real challenges that deserve real solutions, and that’s what I’m fightingfor in Washington. I spend every single day trying to do right by workingfamilies, farmers, students, and veterans here in Montana and across thecountry. I’m running for reelection because there’s still work to be done.Just like my parents and grandparents on the family farm, when I commit tosomething, I see it through. Can you make a split donation of any amount todaybetween my campaign and Voter Protection Project to help me keep up the fightin Washington?(https://act.protectvoting.org/go/83568?t=1003&akid;=17874%2E878179%2ERFLm4a)I’ll leave you with one last truth about farming: Some years you get the rightamount of rain, and things work out really well. Other years, you get a wholelot less. That means it’s important to be prepared for any outcome, and tohave a support system by your side when things get difficult. We don’t knowwhat this campaign will look like, or what Republicans will throw our way overthese final few months. But with your support, we’ll be ready. I appreciateanything you’re able to pitch in. Thanks for your help, and I hope I make youproud. — Jon ------------------ Paid for by Voter Protection Projectwww.protectvoting.org Not authorized by any candidate or candidate'scommittee. 401 2nd Ave. S, Ste. 303, Seattle, WA 98104 Click here to requestfewer emails: https://act.protectvoting.org/signup/fewer-emails/?t=1001&akid;=17874%2E878179%2ERFLm4a Click here to unsubscribe:https://act.protectvoting.org/unsubscribe/unsubscribe/?akid=17874%2E878179%2ERFLm4a",D,TRUE

So knowthat I say this with all sincerity: Project 2025 should make us all afraid. Ifyou haven't heard, Project 2025 is the nearly 1,000-page plan for Republicansto attack our freedoms, wreck our health care, undermine a century ofnonpartisan civil service, and more.

Chip in $15 now >> Chip in $25now >> Chip in $50 now >> Chip in $100 now >> Chip in another amount now >> Ofcourse, as a woman who is an OB/GYN, I immediately went digging for whatProject 2025 would mean for reproductive freedom. What I found is horrifying.Project 2025 would… Create a national abortion database — including creepyinformation like a mother's state of residence, something no politician has aright to know Overrule medical experts at the FDA — Project 2025 would reverseapproval of the abortion pill which the FDA has ruled safe and effective Baneven using the words abortion, gender equality, and reproductive health infederal rules, regulations, and legislation — imagine the impact on things asmonumental as anti-discrimination regulations And MAGA has a plan to make itall happen by firing dedicated civil servants and replacing them with peoplewhose primary qualification is loyalty to Trump.

Peter, I’ve been crisscrossing the countryto do everything I can to help the team get across the finish line this fall.One of my most important stops: campaigning in Ohio with Bernie Moreno.President Trump and a Senate Republican majority will end the disastrousBiden-Harris agenda, but we cannot win a Senate majority without winning inOhio. Will you join me in supporting political outsider, Bernie Moreno?Bernie Moreno is the type of Senator we need in Washington. He’s lived theAmerican dream - and wants to make sure our grandkids have the sameopportunities he had when he came to America at the age of five. He hasn’tmade a career as a Washington insider - just the opposite. He’s anentrepreneur who built a successful business from the ground up. ThisNovember, we’ve got a great map—unlike anything we’ve seen in a fewdecades—and with high-quality candidates like Bernie, I know we can win backthe Republican majority in the Senate. But here’s the bad news, Peter.Democrats like Sherrod Brown are outraising us by millions. I’ve alreadytransferred $4 million to help folks like Bernie, but he needs folks like youto step up to take on a 50-year career politician in Sherrod Brown. Even just$10 can make a difference when it comes to the millions Sherrod Brown israising from every liberal in the country. We have got to change the courseof this country and put an end to the dangerous Harris-Schumer-Brownagenda—and that begins with doing everything we can to help Bernie Moreno winin Ohio and elect a Republican majority in the Senate! Thanks, John ThuneSenate Minority Whip Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fights for theAmerican Dream because he’s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia. Atage five, his American Dream began when he moved to the United States with hisfamily. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentlesswork ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first cardealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groupsin America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformationalpotential of blockchain technology, before it received mainstream attention,and moved much of his volunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernieserved as Chairman of the Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie soldmost of his business to begin focusing on his calling: protecting the Americandream for another generation. Solving our country’s problems requires commonsense. In Washington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect ourfreedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, andalways put America First. Ohioans are done with politicians who talk a biggame and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. to get work done – just likehe always has.

FOR MONTHS, our team defied the odds – and polling showed me on track to win Nevada’s battleground Senate race. THEN, Donald Trump started ruthlessly attacking me and national Republicans poured tens of millions of dollars into this race to defeat me. Mitch McConnell’s super PAC even announced another surprise $6.2 MILLION ad blitz for the last 2 weeks of the election. NOW: A new poll was released that shows me TIED with my far-right opponent – in the race experts say will decide Senate control. I can’t sugarcoat it: this is the worst case scenario for Democrats. Everything from abortion rights to protecting our democracy is on the line in this race. But Republicans have the upper hand in Nevada – and they are on the path to flipping our state red, taking back Senate control, and electing Donald Trump. Nevadans are already voting, so we need to turn this around RIGHT NOW. I just met with my senior advisors and we set a goal to raise $500,000 by midnight tonight. But time is running out, and we’re still falling short. Please, I swear I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important. Can you split $5 or more to my campaign and Raphael Warnock RIGHT NOW so we can win in Nevada, defend our Senate majority, and keep Donald Trump out of the White House? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/warnock-for-georgia_email-rosen?refcode=jtk5462-bu-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Thank you.

Friends of Mark Warner,Mark Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,I’ve spent a lot of time with Tim Kaine,11/1/24 21:41,2024,11,1,21,41,markwarnerva.com,"Derek, I’ve had the honor of being Tim Kaine’s friend since we met at HarvardLaw School in 1980. For over 40 years, I’ve watched him wholeheartedly serveVirginia, first as mayor of Richmond, then as my Lieutenant Governor, andlater Governor, before serving together in the United States Senate. Thismeans I’ve spent a lot of time with Tim and gathered plenty of intel on him.So as I sat down to write this email asking you to support Senator Kaine’s re-election campaign, I found myself wondering exactly what I should say to youto assure you that Tim is the right choice to represent Virginia in Congress.And then it dawned on me: I want to tell you the top 3 things that annoy methe most about Tim Kaine. First off, Tim is way too nice! As a former civilrights attorney and missionary, he’s spent his entire career committed tosocial justice, being driven by the value of kindness and the belief that itcan change peoples’ lives. And he’s a genuinely good guy on top of that.Second, he’s ridiculously good at playing the harmonica. Seriously, he carriesthem in his briefcase, just in case a jam session breaks out on the Senatefloor. Third and finally, and I’ve said this before, he’s a deeply optimisticperson. Sometimes I can be a glass half-empty kind of guy, but Tim’s alwaysseems about ⅔ full. We need someone like Tim Kaine in the Senate. Tim’s valueof kindness and decency is what drives his undying dedication to serving thepeople of Virginia. And in a Congress plagued by partisan division, Tim’srelentless optimism keeps him from giving up in the crucial fights to protectvoting rights, safeguard a woman’s right to choose, and more. Now theharmonica… that one might not always translate to his work as a Senator, it’sjust really great to watch. The thing is, Tim’s seat could very well determineif the GOP takes control on Tuesday. Republicans are working overtime to ousthim and take back control of the Senate.

ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ FOR CONGRESS,AOC,speak@ocasiocortez.com,I’ll tell you what I believe:,11/1/24 21:57,2024,11,1,21,57,ocasiocortez.com,"[1]Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for Congress We live in a constant state ofinjustice. We are always struggling against systems of mass incarceration, ofextreme income inequality, of late stage capitalism. Those conditions doexist. But one thing that I think is important is that we must mobilize for anaffirmative vision for this country — we can’t just mobilize on fear. We needto be clear about what the stakes are. We do. But I don’t believe in a ‘fearonly’ approach. I’ll tell you what I believe: I believe in a bare minimum. $15minimum wage needed to be passed several years ago. I believe in guaranteed,improved, and expanded Medicare to every single American. We can’t give up.I’ve been in that place when I was a waitress. I did spend some time giving upand being cynical and saying, “F*ck this.” And you know what it got us?Nothing. Depression, cynicism, and a sense of purposelessness. Giving up is aprivilege that people just can’t afford. Movements wax and wane. And there aretimes when it feels like our power is waning, and it’s really easy to take ourball and go home. But the strength of a movement really depends on thedurability of it, and the commitment to it. That black pill of cynicism is thedeath of movements, not the birth of them.

I just made atough decision that you need to hear about immediately. According to severalrecent reports, Tim Sheehy lied about his military service. 1. On the campaigntrail, Sheehy claimed he had a gunshot wound in his arm from combat. Butaccording to the New York Times , public records, and firsthandaccounts—including a Navy SEAL who served with Sheehy—his gunshot wound wasfrom accidentally shooting himself in the arm in Glacier National Park. 2.Days later, NBC News released another bombshell report stating Sheehy liedabout being “medically discharged” from the Navy. It’s shocking—and Montanansmust know the truth but we’re running out of time. So I made the difficultdecision to launch more television and digital ads today. The money isn’t inthe budget yet—but with polls in the margin of error, running these final adscould be enough to break the tie in Jon’s favor and win this race.

Citizens to Elect Rick Larsen,Rick Larsen,campaign@ricklarsen.org,The GOP will seek “massive reform” to the Affordable Care Act,11/1/24 22:05,2024,11,1,22,5,ricklarsen.org,"This month, we have spent a lot of time campaigning, talking about next week'selection, and emphasizing the urgency around taking back the House. HouseSpeaker Mike Johnson's comments this week are a prime example of why Democratsneed control of the House. This week, during a GOP campaign event, SpeakerJohnson indicated that if Republicans gain control of the presidency in 2024,they will pursue ""massive reform"" to the ACA as part of a ""very aggressive""first 100-day agenda. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been a lifeline forWashingtonians, improving health outcomes, offering financial security, andenabling equitable access to health care across diverse communities in thestate. Make no mistake: the Chaos Caucus still wants to undermine criticalhealth care programs and unwind health insurance regulations and safeguardsdespite the overwhelming support for the program. ACA enrollment has hit ahistoric level, with 21.3 million people opting for ACA marketplace coverageduring the Open Enrollment Period. This statistic includes more than fivemillion people — about a fourth — who are new to the ACA Marketplace and 16million people who renewed their existing ACA coverage. With enrollmentreaching a record high and millions of American families relying on the ACAfor coverage, it simply does not make sense that the Chaos Caucus' agenda isto repeal this landmark legislation. Rolling back the ACA would not just ripaway critical care from the 21.3 million folks using Marketplace plans — but45 million Americans could lose their health insurance provided through otherprovisions of the ACA . Think young adults afforded the option to stay ontheir parents' plans until age 26, people suffering from pre-existingconditions that could legally be denied care, and more. We cannot let thishappen to the millions of people relying on the ACA. We must take back theHouse next week. Our final weekend Get-Out-The-Vote canvassing efforts starttomorrow.

Time and again, myRepublican colleagues in the House propose a budget that would destroy thislife-saving legislation. We will not let that stand.I believe health care is aright. As always, we are going to fight back for Washingtonians and themillions of Americans who benefit from the provisions of the ACA. That is whyI voted to reduce premiums for ACA members and am actively working to expandaccess to high-quality, affordable health care that fits Northwest Washingtonfamilies' budgets. That is why I am continuing to work to lower the costs ofprescription drugs. I voted to reduce prescription drug costs by lettingMedicare negotiate drug prices, by imposing a tax penalty if drug companiesincrease their prices faster than inflation, and by capping the price ofinsulin at $35 per month. Millions of Americans are counting on us. This isthe type of policy-making that has a tangible impact on Northwest Washington,and we must protect the ACA in Congress.

That’s why I’ve been barnstorming the state and sending so many emailsasking for help. I truly appreciate all you’ve done to support my campaign.But I still need help-this race is still too close! Why is my race so close?Unfortunately, one reason is that my opponent Colin Allred is untruthful, andis attempting to hide his radical liberal views from Texas voters. It takes alot of time and money to set the record straight… For example, on the borderAllred now claims to love border security, and belatedly says he wants to finda solution to the Biden-Harris border crisis, but that’s not how Allred votedin Congress… In Congress, Allred was an Open Borders Radical who voted AGAINSTthe interests of Texas and FOR open borders lawlessness numerous times: Allredvoted AGAINST the Secure the Border Act. Allred voted AGAINST denouncing theBiden Administration’s immigration policies. Allred voted AGAINST condemningthe Biden border crisis and the tremendous burdens law enforcement officersface as a result. Allred voted AGAINST the POLICE Act, which would immediatelydeport any illegal alien who assaults a law enforcement officer. Allred votedAGAINST the SAVE Act, which was a bill that would block illegal aliens fromvoting in U.S. elections. And perhaps most shamefully, Allred SKIPPED a voteon the End the Border Catastrophe Act… It takes a lot of time and money to setthe record straight…and of course the liberal media is working overtime tohelp Allred hide his record.

These candidatesneed our help: Andrea Salinas is running for re-election in Oregon’s 6thCongressional District. In Congress Andrea has been a tireless champion forour environment and the well-being of the entire Pacific Northwest. She’sfighting for a clean energy future for her daughter and all Americans. In 2022Andrea won by less than three points, so it’s critical we defend her seat thisyear. Kristen McDonald Rivet is running to flip Michigan’s 8th CongressionalDistrict. In the state senate, Kristen helped pass ambitious clean energylegislation to address the climate crisis, create clean jobs, and saveMichiganders money. She also secured funding to replace lead pipes and ensurekids have clean drinking water at schools. Dave Min is running forCalifornia’s 47th Congressional District. As a state senator, Dave chaired theNatural Resources and Water Committee and introduced legislation to terminateoffshore oil and gas leases and secured funding to improve beaches.

[https://secure.ngpvan.com/uB3EyayArUyKTBgRW_x--A2] Hello, After fivebrand-new polls showed me LEADING my opponent Republican Deb Fischer here inNebraska’s Senate race, Fischer’s campaign and Mitch McConnell's Super PACsbought over $13.1 MILLION in TV ads attacking me. Fischer and McConnell havebegun absolutely blanketing the state with TV ads, attacking me withridiculous lies. We have an opportunity to win Nebraska’s Senate seat – butonly if we can counter the lies and match them on the air. That’s why I justmade a very difficult decision and told my campaign we could begin airing moreof our own ads to fight back, even though we don’t technically have all themoney in our budget to do so just yet. We’re taking this risk because we haveto. Nebraska is now the closest Senate race in the entire country according toresearchers at Princeton University. So I made an executive decision and tooka bet that grassroots donors like you would come through and help us fill our$100,000 budget gap… We need to do everything we can if we’re going to winthis Senate seat and elect a blue-collar worker to be the 51st vote in theU.S. Senate. That means taking a few risks. But if we're going to defeatRepublican Deb Fischer and win this Senate seat, I’m counting on grassrootsdonors like you to help raise another $100,000 before our deadline at midnighttonight, close our budget gap, and ensure our new TV ads can keep running. I’mnot taking a dime of corporate PAC money. Instead, I’m relying entirely onpeople like you to fund my campaign. Please, will you rush a donation to mycampaign right now – every dollar you can afford – to keep our new ads on theair, defeat Republican Deb Fischer, and win this Senate seat?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=385a52d2-a098-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=385a52d2-a098-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=385a52d2-a098-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=385a52d2-a098-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=385a52d2-a098-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=385a52d2-a098-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=385a52d2-a098-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]There are going to be a one or two more hard spending decisions like thisbetween now and Election Day.

One poll conducted by the Trafalgar Group even showedHovdeleading by one point. Democrats have pulled their fire alarm and arepouring money into the state to save Baldwin. ► Businessman Bernie Moreno ison the verge of defeating incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown in Ohio, who hasbeen a politician for over fifty years. Rasmussen Reports has Moreno up by onepoint, while theWashington Post has his down by one point. This is the bestchance we've had to defeat Brown in years. ► Senator Ted Cruz is theDemocrats' #1 target this year, and they are dumping millions of dollars intoTexas to turn Texas Blue. His opponent, Rep. Colin Allred, is a Kamala Harrisliberal who is desperately trying to hide his record. The Hill/Emerson Collegepoll showed Cruz leading by only one point. ► Conservative former TV newsanchor Kari Lake is surging in Arizona and only trails liberal Ruben Gallegoby four points. But apparently, she's too conservative for Mitch McConnell,who refuses to spend the party's money to support her. There's still time forher to win in a state where President Trump is expanding his lead. ► Armycombat veteran Sam Brown is rapidly gaining on incumbent Senator Jacky Rosenin Nevada.

As Attorney General Holder says,“The path to progress, the path to the America we ought to become, runsthrough the ballot… Democracy is the right that protects the rest.”Manipulated electoral maps — ones that are drawn with surgical precision bypoliticians to preserve their party’s political power — silence the will ofthe people and allow extreme MAGA Republicans to enact egregious legislationthat does not reflect the viewpoints of most Americans.

I know people usually think ofCalifornia as a solid blue state, but there are some extremely competitiveraces happening right now: from Will Rollins against MAGA Ken Calvert (thesame Republican who OUTED ME in the 1990s) , to Derek Tran against MichelleSteel (recently called the most competitive toss-up election in the country).So what else needs to be said? There is so much work left to be done — doorsto knock, undecided voters to speak with, and ads to fund. IF we let up ourefforts for a single moment, MAGA Republicans will be almost guaranteed to winin this 50-50 election… BUT IF we band together in these next 4 days, fightback with everything we have, and don’t let a single second go to waste, thenI know in my soul that we will be victorious on November 5th.

The bad news: Democracy is on its deathbed…and things justwent from bad to worse! First, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris imported “asylumseekers” directly into critical swing states! Then, Republican leaders foughtback and attempted to BAN all non-citizens from voting, and they were blockedby radical Democrats.. Recently, Virginia attempted to REMOVE all non-citizenballots from being counted. But Kamala and her corrupt DOJ SUED to ensurethousands of NON-CITIZEN VOTERS stay on the voter rolls! If we don’t respondright now, there’s no telling how far they’ll go to go through with thisderanged plot! RUSH EMERGENCY SUPPORT! Peter, the radical left is now notjust allowing non-citizen voting, they are actively fighting to PROTECT non-citizen voting at all costs, and using their DOJ as an enforcement arm fortheir plan to permanently eliminate the two-party state! Elon Musk explainedit perfectly: “If even 1 in 20 illegals become citizens per year, somethingthat the Democrats are expediting as fast as humanly possible, that would beabout 2 million new legal voters in 4 years.” –Elon Musk With just tens ofthousands of votes often determining victory in swing states, these newimported voters would tip the scales and completely eliminate swing statesaltogether!All we’re asking is for $4 in these final 4 days to fight back!FIGHT BACK with $4! Democrats will have complete and total control, markingthe end of Democracy as we know it! Peter, we know receiving emails like thisisn’t fun! We don’t take joy in sending them.

Debbie for Florida,"Debbie, me",info@e.debbieforflorida.com,I'm putting my record up against Rick Scott's,11/1/24 23:06,2024,11,1,23,6,e.debbieforflorida.com,"Friend — by now, with just 4 days until Election Day, I hope you have a goodsense of who I am and the issues I believe are so important. But I thought alittle reminder would be helpful, especially contrasted with who Rick Scott is🤢. Maybe it will even motivate you to make your very first online donationbefore tonight's fundraising deadline to ensure I can defeat Rick Scott!https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2476-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 First and foremost, I'm everything I am todaybecause of my mother. She brought my sisters and me to America when I was just14. Mom knew we had to get out of Ecuador, which was transitioning todemocracy after suffering under a military dictatorship. She knew America wasthe key to a better life. Well, with a whole lot of hard work (includingworking in a doughnut shop to help my family get by), long hours, and a ton ofhope, we were able to win our American dream. My story is what inspires me togive back to this incredible country and state that gave me so much. Afterputting myself through college, I worked for several nonprofit organizationsacross Florida, helping to protect our wildlife and preserve our coral reefs.Rick Scott, on the other hand, banned saying the words ""climate change"" whenhe was governor of Florida, and the League of Conservation Voters gave him awhopping 0% score last year. During my time working at Florida InternationalUniversity, I spearheaded a new program to expand affordable health careaccess to more Floridians. But Rick Scott has voted to repeal the AffordableCare Act more times than I care to count. And who can forget he committed oneof the largest Medicare frauds in the history of our country. Eventually, Ihad the honor of serving my community in the U.S. House of Representatives,where I became the first South American immigrant to be elected to Congress!In the House, I wrote the bill to expand seniors’ Medicare Advantage coverage,worked with Republicans to provide economic relief to families and smallbusinesses, and secured $200 million for Everglades restoration. I'm proud ofmy record — but can Rick Scott say the same, friend? He has used his time inoffice writing the plan to end Social Security and Medicare, attempting toundermine our elections, attacking our rights, and making it harder forworking families to get ahead. As a result, Rick Scott's approval ratings withFloridians are underwater. Even a large percentage of Republicans don'tapprove of him! Now, polling shows me statistically tied with Scott, and injust 4 days, we can defeat him and protect our Democratic Senate majority inthe process. But with Rick Scott outspending me 3-1 on the airwaves, it'sgoing to take a surge in grassroots support from people like you to trulydefeat him. So please, rush a donation of $5 or whatever you can to send me tothe U.S. Senate and give Floridians the true leader and public servant wedeserve!https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2476-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 -------- This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

Keith Ellison for Attorney General committee,Keith Ellison,campaign@keithellison.org,If you’re considering sitting out this election because of Gaza,11/1/24 23:11,2024,11,1,23,11,keithellison.org,"Peter, I suspect the majority of you reading this email have already voted orhave made a plan to vote for Kamala Harris for President and Tim Walz for VicePresident. If so, thank you, and please sign up for a GOTV shift athttps://www.mobilize.us/2024mnvictory/! You don’t need to read this email anyfurther. But I am aware some of you may be considering sitting this electionout, or voting for a third-party candidate, because you strongly disagree withKamala Harris about Gaza. This email is for you. Please read on. We have manythings in common. Like you, I am outraged by the suffering in Gaza: themassive and indiscriminate loss of life, the displacement of millions ofpeople, the deliberate destruction of hospitals, the use of food as a weapon,all of it. Every nation, including Israel, has the right to defend itself, andall hostages must be released now. But no nation, including Israel, has theright to collectively punish another people, including the people of Gaza. Butthat is what has happened, and like you, I believe American policy has notdone enough to stop it. Now to Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris has said she’s fora cease fire. She’s said she’s for more humanitarian relief now. She standsfor international human-rights laws, and she has the active support of membersof Congress who are insisting on the enforcement of international human-rightslaw. And she has publicly called out Rudy Giuliani’s violent rhetoric aboutPalestinian children at Trump’s racist Madison Square Garden rally. And as shesaid in her speech in Washington on Tuesday night, she will listen toeveryone, including people who disagree with her. I’ve known her for years, soI know from personal experience that this is true. On the other hand, DonaldTrump, who put in place the illegal Muslim ban as president, has said he’lllet Benjamin Netanyahu “finish the job.” Donald Trump, whose own chief ofstaff says he is a fascist, has promised to deploy the military againstconstitutional protest and be a dictator on Day One. So if you care about thepeople of Gaza — and the right to protest about Gaza — you don’t want DonaldTrump in power. Now I doubt any of you reading this email plan to vote forDonald Trump. But — and this is critical — if you sit this election out, or ifyou vote for a third-party candidate who will not win, you are letting DonaldTrump get one vote closer to power. Donald Trump in power will increasesuffering in Gaza and the world. If Kamala Harris is elected, we will havesomeone in the White House who will use the powers of the presidency toalleviate suffering at home and abroad, not increase it. Just as importantly,we will have someone in the White House with whom we can be in dialogue, notsomeone who will turn our country against us. Don’t take only it from me.Senator Bernie Sanders supports Kamala Harris even though he stronglydisagrees with current Gaza policy, because he believes that Kamala in theWhite House is the best chance to change that policy.

I strongly encourage you to listen tothem. And finally, even as Gaza is first in many of our thoughts, even more isat stake in this election. Racial justice, abortion rights, climate change,and economic fairness: it’s all on the ballot, along with the very soul ofthis country. Trump’s racist Madison Square Garden rally leaves no more roomfor doubt about that. For the sake of all the people that would bear the bruntof Donald Trump’s deliberate cruelty, and for the best chance of building abetter future for the people of Gaza, the Middle East, the United States, andthe world, I am asking you not to sit this out: I am asking for your vote forKamala Harris for President and Tim Walz for Vice President. - Keith Preparedand paid for by the Keith Ellison for Attorney General committee, PO Box17224, Minneapolis, MN 55417 Keith Ellison for Attorney General PO Box 17224Minneapolis, MN 55417 United States If you believe you received this messagein error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please unsubscribe:https://secure.ngpvan.com/p/rnmAh_BZp0CUaBw6XYl7Xw2?unsubscribedata=2W3VAJdw0Km2QlWjWSNn5jILNXUrlnEvliKA4k45I5pVyuqoBa4Y3UFm3BhbuqHtqqYrTIxbuJjziosllmOXfejlaoFG7D3AFDxJQG93VgilTx6DNsKdZMq%2FC2O3PQ%2F7BSpw91OasYmadv2hVJ%2F4elgiqlhVrEn8xl2lKfAyhd87jzDY6fFGwvfYWo7%2BOwui6dGaOsBEWAoyDu%2BaV7KBvNKX8hASP2M4qjbsfyGIzPQ7TxfTZTFaQgp3IYTwE9WBLAlxcSLEA5OK5pJjTWRqM6PnUTx%2B%2BQtqhSH6S%2B5v6nmHFpYEVkzLQ0tDTItkioUCjKTmQHt%2Bg9VoP1RJTtAVnAuUK8ObOKuEtRLoGf9z8Vv%2B9lwyIdQN0jkW8gZoR6D0H3taZ70cUxj55pabsOMrgUZPOCStGYjYt%2B55QwokiuMqRzJHxx8BVU5cxIFJ4Thh.",D,TRUE

Peter, I’ve been crisscrossing the countryto do everything I can to help the team get across the finish line this fall.One of my most important stops: campaigning in Ohio with Bernie Moreno.President Trump and a Senate Republican majority will end the disastrousBiden-Harris agenda, but we cannot win a Senate majority without winning inOhio. Will you join me in supporting political outsider, Bernie Moreno?Bernie Moreno is the type of Senator we need in Washington. He’s lived theAmerican dream - and wants to make sure our grandkids have the sameopportunities he had when he came to America at the age of five. He hasn’tmade a career as a Washington insider - just the opposite. He’s anentrepreneur who built a successful business from the ground up. ThisNovember, we’ve got a great map—unlike anything we’ve seen in a fewdecades—and with high-quality candidates like Bernie, I know we can win backthe Republican majority in the Senate. But here’s the bad news, Peter.Democrats like Sherrod Brown are outraising us by millions. I’ve alreadytransferred $4 million to help folks like Bernie, but he needs folks like youto step up to take on a 50-year career politician in Sherrod Brown. Even just$10 can make a difference when it comes to the millions Sherrod Brown israising from every liberal in the country. We have got to change the courseof this country and put an end to the dangerous Harris-Schumer-Brownagenda—and that begins with doing everything we can to help Bernie Moreno winin Ohio and elect a Republican majority in the Senate! Thanks, John ThuneSenate Minority Whip Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fights for theAmerican Dream because he’s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia. Atage five, his American Dream began when he moved to the United States with hisfamily. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentlesswork ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first cardealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groupsin America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformationalpotential of blockchain technology, before it received mainstream attention,and moved much of his volunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernieserved as Chairman of the Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie soldmost of his business to begin focusing on his calling: protecting the Americandream for another generation. Solving our country’s problems requires commonsense. In Washington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect ourfreedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, andalways put America First. Ohioans are done with politicians who talk a biggame and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. to get work done – just likehe always has.

It was a hate-fest of disgusting rhetoric aboutimmigrants, Puerto Ricans, Black Americans, Jews, Muslims, and anyone the MAGAmovement deems their enemy. It also wasn't lost on me that House Speaker MikeJohnson attended and gave a speech, after which Trump later thanked him andominously declared: ""our little secret is having a big impact, he and I have alittle secret, we will tell you what it is when the race is over."" Whetherthat means Johnson is ready to legislatively implement Project 2025, orwhether he's planning to have the House deny a free and fair election, I can'tsay. But I can say that Mike Johnson giving his seal of approval to adisgusting rally and him being praised by Donald Trump as cooking up a secretplan with him shows that we cannot afford to have him as Speaker again comeJanuary. With only 4 days left, the state of play for control of the Houseremains as close as ever — and flipping the 5th District here in Oregon fromred to blue remains one of the biggest steps we can take toward gaining aDemocratic House majority.

Earlier this week, myopponent, Rick Scott, was at one of Donald Trump's campaign events. That's nosurprise. He's everywhere Donald Trump goes. He infamously skipped animportant Senate vote to be Trump's lapdog in the courtroom for one of Trump'scriminal trials.Pathetic. Anyway, Donald Trump gave Rick Scott a very ...interesting shoutout: It's interesting how often Trump resorts to callingother people liars — when he himself is perhaps the most notorious serial liarin modern American history. It's no wonder he and Rick Scott get along sowell. Scott has lied time and again about his record of writing the plan toend Medicare and Social Security, about supporting a national abortion ban,and even about his Medicare fraud. Lies, lies, and more lies from the snakethat is Rick Scott and his buddy, the twice-impeached, disgraced liar of aformer president, Donald Trump. The TRUTH of the matter is that Donald Trumpand Rick Scott are scared of my new ad. They are scared because they know I'mstatistically tied with Scott in the polls as Floridians are beginning to casttheir ballots. They are scared we will pull off a massive political upset byflipping Florida blue.Well, Peter, they are right to be scared. We can winthis race and protect Democratic Senate control in the process, but it simplyis not possible if I don't hit my $10 million fundraising goal to fight RickScott's attack ads and reach every Florida voter. So please, rush a donationof $5 or whatever you can to help me hit my last fundraising deadline beforeElection Day, defeat Rick Scott, and protect our Democratic Senate majority!If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donationwill go through immediately: RUSH $25 IMMEDIATELY RUSH $50 IMMEDIATELY RUSH$100 IMMEDIATELY RUSH $250 IMMEDIATELY RUSH $500 IMMEDIATELY RUSH ANOTHERAMOUNT Thank you, Debbie DONATE Paid for by Defeat Boebert PAC This emailwas sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com .

Eugene served 25 years in the Army and is ready to fight with Jason Crow to defend our democracy against Donald Trump’s allies. We hope you’ll read his message below, and then split a donation between his and Jason’s campaigns. Hi team — it’s Eugene Vindman. I had some things on my mind I needed to share with you. I never envisioned myself running for Congress. It wasn't part of the plan. But over the past 5 years — since Trump made that phone call attempting to extort Ukraine — the Republican party has shown the dangerous path they are willing to tread. And we have seen firsthand the threat that extremism poses to our democracy. So I launched this campaign because I needed to do something — I needed to continue defending our democracy in whatever capacity I could. Because our children and families deserve better than the extremists we have now in Congress, controlling the People’s House. I’ve only gotten this far with pure grassroots support. Support from folks like you. And I can only pass the finish line with you by my side. With only four days to go until the most critical election of our lifetimes, I am asking: Can you please split $10 between my campaign for Congress and Jason Crow's today? That’s it. Just $10. Because when you and everyone reading this email give $10, we will have the power to defeat our MAGA extremist opponent at the polls in four days and flip the House majority blue.

I really want you to see the whole thing. Please check this out! WATCH PRES. TRUMP’S NM REMARKS » —Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

This week, we learned that hasn’t been the case for myopponent, Joe McGraw. From WIFR: “The Illinois State Board of Electionsconfirmed the former 17th Judicial Circuit judge wasn’t a resident of the areahe would represent if elected on Nov. 5.” As someone representing my hometown,I’m definitely doing so with a heightened sense of duty. That’s what decadesof building relationships and absorbing local values will do to you, and it’swhy I always felt a deep sense of responsibility as a meteorologist -- helpingmy community understand the risks and make well-informed decisions. So maybethat’s why WBEZ reported that McGraw has been “repeating Trump campaigntalking points” on the trail instead of representing what’s popular in thedistrict – he’s not going to be fighting for us, but for his MAGA mega-donorshoping to flip this seat. We need support to make sure our voices come first,not MAGA. If you can, please chip in $10 to keep our momentum going. Let’s re-elect someone focused on IL-17 first.

Plus, key ways to engage in the final push!! Melissa Calls on Adam Smith to Step Aside - and during this peaceful statement, the police are called! As we entered the final week before Election Day, Melissa Chaudhry issued a public statement calling on Adam Smith to take his own advice to Joe Biden, and step aside. Shockingly, the police were called on us as we were peacefully gathered outside Smith's federal office - paid for by our tax money, and legally required to be accessible to the public! Yet another example of Adam Smith violating fundamental American freedoms of speech and assembly - which, we'll recall, is why he was formally Condemned and Censured by the 43rd LD Democrats, earlier this year! Please watch the video below, and please forward to your friends and family. Whether they've already voted or not, everyone needs to know who Smith is, what he's done, and why we need to vote him out. In these final days, please do everything you can to help get the word out! Join us to canvass or sign-wave - events listed on the website here! Give the campaign a Like, Comment, Follow, and Share on social media - and make your own posts sharing why you're a supporter! Get in touch with your friends and family and let them know why they should vote for Melissa. Chip in financially to help strengthen the campaign in this final push! Remember, Melissa's campaign is ENTIRELY supported by individuals - not foreign interests, corporate PACs, or war profiteers! Why? Because she believes government should truly be Of, By, and For the People - and serve and uphold Liberty and Justice for ALL. Let's make history together and elect Melissa to Congress!

Iam and always will be a farmer, like my folks and my grandparents before me.In fact, I’m very proud to be the U.S. Senate’s only working dirt farmer.Every spring, I spend a lot of weeks working the stubble, getting equipmentready for planting, and out in the field seeding. Come summer, I am out thereharvesting. I maintain my own heavy equipment and deliver my grain in a truckthat’s a bit bigger than what any of my colleagues drive. I buy grease by thecase and seeds by the ton. I butcher my own beef. My wife, Sharla, and I workthe farm hand-in-hand. The task of scheduling my work in the Senate around theinflexible timing of farm responsibilities drives my staff crazy — but theyknow my farm work is non-negotiable. It keeps me, quite literally, grounded.And rather than spend my days hobnobbing with special interests, I rely onhardworking folks like you to power everything we do.

For American Greatness!Bernie Moreno GOP Nominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Morenofights for the American Dream because he’s lived it. Bernie was born inBogota, Colombia. At age five, his American Dream began when he moved to theUnited States with his family. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18.Through his relentless work ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, heturned the first car dealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of thelargest dealership groups in America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value andtransformational potential of blockchain technology, before it receivedmainstream attention, and moved much of his volunteer time and investmentdollars into the space. In 2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to bequite successful as Bernie served as Chairman of the Board. After a long,successful career, Bernie sold most of his business to begin focusing on hiscalling: protecting the American dream for another generation. Solving ourcountry’s problems requires common sense. In Washington, Bernie will fight toshrink government, protect our freedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party fromtaking our data and land, and always put America First.

With Election Day right around the corner, I’m reaching out to seeif you will join the Jane Fonda Climate PAC and PCCC in supporting a slate ofclimate champions in the final stretch of this critical election. I want totell you more about why I’m so excited to support these candidates, but first,can you chip in $20 to split a contribution for these candidates ahead ofElection Day?[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/pccc_2024_house_janefonda?refcode=email_110124_kmr-fonda-split] I’m excited to team up with the PCCC to support a slate ofincredible climate candidates running in competitive congressional races whoare committed to tackling the climate crisis, including standing up topowerful special interests like the fossil fuel industry. These candidatesneed our help: * Kristen McDonald Rivet is running to flip Michigan’s 8thCongressional District . In the state senate, Kristen helped pass ambitiousclean energy legislation to address the climate crisis, create clean jobs, andsave Michiganders money. She also secured funding to replace lead pipes andensure kids have clean drinking water at schools. * Dave Min is running forCalifornia’s 47th Congressional District . As a state senator, Dave chairedthe Natural Resources and Water Committee and introduced legislation toterminate offshore oil and gas leases and secured funding to improve beaches.* Andrea Salinas is running for re-election in Oregon’s 6th CongressionalDistrict . In Congress Andrea has been a tireless champion for our environmentand the well-being of the entire Pacific Northwest. She’s fighting for a cleanenergy future for her daughter and all Americans. In 2022 Andrea won by lessthan three points, so it’s critical we defend her seat this year. Corporatespecial interests and far-right extremists are pouring millions into theseraces to defeat these progressive climate champions. For the sake of ourenvironment and electing a pro-environment Congress, we must have their backs.Can you help us ensure these climate champions have the resources they need towin?

Did you see the final race ratings from the Cook Political Report? Cook Political is a premier election forecaster that identifies the most competitive swing seats nationwide. And they’ve determined that California has more competitive tossup seats than any other state in the country. Next Tuesday, control of the U.S. House is going to come down to us. Let’s not leave anything on the field. Please, will you pitch in a donation of $ or more right now?

If we don’t flip these seats, Democrats have no chance of taking back our House Majority. That means another two years of Speaker Johnson who will do everything in his power to obstruct a President Harris or enable a dangerous President Donald Trump. We have the power to fire Speaker Johnson and take back the House of Representatives. But if our GOTV budget runs dry this weekend, it will be that much harder for our organizers on the ground to reach undecided voters and win these districts. We know that we’ve asked a lot this past month, but it’s all coming down to this: Will you please consider donating $ or more? The stakes couldn’t be higher.

This is THE most important thing you can do today to defend the Senate >> https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_tester?refcode=jtk5615-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 I’m not kidding—this race is as serious as it gets. Newsweek is calling Montana the only real toss-up in the entire country, and Mitch McConnell and his rich buddies are throwing almost $90 million into this race. That’s more cash than Jon’s faced in every campaign of his life, COMBINED! And now I’m hearing Jon’s still falling behind on fundraising. Are you kidding me?! The only way he’s gonna pull this off is if more grassroots folks like you get FIRED UP and start giving right now. Not tomorrow. Not later tonight. RIGHT NOW. I’m practically on my knees here: Will you make a split donation to help Jon Tester beat McConnell’s handpicked puppet? If you care about the Senate and about stopping the GOP, please give what you can now >> https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_tester?refcode=jtk5615-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you, James Carville -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

And if they succeed with their plans, regular, everydayAmericans will pay the price. I could go on and on about why we need to winthis race, but I’ll just cut to the chase: Will you please split $5 (or more!)between my campaign and UNITEDemocrats to help me defeat Republican LarryHogan and keep Maryland blue?

In response,my team and I are taking action with ads of our own — but unlike my ultra-wealthy opponent, I can’t keep them live without a massive surge of grassrootssupport to reach my FINAL $4 million goal ahead of Election Day. So please,friend, can I count on you to chip in $5 right now to help me expose the truthabout Rick Scott's lies?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2467-fr-text LOOK: Rick Scott is desperate to be the next leader of the Senate GOP.And since this race will decide Senate control, he's not leaving anything tochance. He's proven time and again that he cares only about helping ultra-wealthy oligarchs like himself, having written the plan to END Social Securityand Medicare and RAISE taxes on middle class families. He even voted for anationwide BAN on abortions ... even though a majority of Florida voterssupport keeping abortion legal. And he knows his positions are fundamentallyunpopular in Florida — it's why he spent $64 MILLION to buy this seat in 2018,and why he announced a SEVEN-FIGURE ad spend to buy it again. But frankly,friend, I've had enough. Ya no más. I’m running to retire Rick Scott and givethe Sunshine State a Senator who actually cares about fighting for Florida'sworking families. But to withstand Scott's barrage of nasty ads and staycompetitive against his self-funded campaign, I can't afford to fall short ofmy LAST $4 million fundraising goal of the election.

Everything is OK, it'sjust that I'm a bundle of nerves and excitement in these final days of thecampaign, where we are so close to actually defeating Rick Scott andprotecting Democratic control of the Senate! I need you to know that we neverwould have gotten to a point where the polls are statistically tied, wherebrand new polling data has me leading by 18 points with independent voters,where Rick Scott is forced to spend tens of millions of dollars to competewith our grassroots movement, and where the major Democratic committees spendmillions of dollars of their own money to help us because they believe in us!Thank you, friend. A year ago at this time, the political pundits wrote offFlorida completely. We put Florida in play. We gave Rick Scott his notice. Weare on the cusp of pulling off the greatest political upset in modern history.But Rick Scott is outspending me nearly 3-to-1 on the airwaves — and he'salready spent over $38 million on ads to defeat me. Well, I don't have afraudulently earned fortune like him to tap into. I have you, friend. I havethis grassroots movement. And I can only fight back and win by closing in onmy final $4 million goal before Election Day. So please, will you make adonation of $5 or more to help me make history here in Florida? Whatever yougive will be put to work immediately to counter Rick Scott's attack ads,defeat him once and for all, and save our Democratic Senate majority!https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2478-fr-text Well, there's another cup of coffee gone ☕️.

Both chambers are toss-ups, and whether pro-democracy candidates areelected could decide whether we have a path to redistricting reform. * InArizona we’re mobilizing against a ballot initiative that would essentiallyend term limits for state supreme court and appellate court judges — includingthose already serving. * Michigan voters passed a ballot initiative to createa fair redistricting process. But extremists are trying to take back the statehouse — and if they win, they could plan harmful changes to the state’sindependent redistricting commission.

Gillibrand for Senate,Team Tester,kg@kirstengillibrand.com,I just made a tough decision,11/2/24 11:24,2024,11,2,11,24,kirstengillibrand.com,"Hello—it’s Shelbi, Jon Tester’s Campaign Manager. I just made a tough decision that you need to hear about immediately. According to several recent reports, Tim Sheehy lied about his military service. 1. On the campaign trail, Sheehy claimed he had a gunshot wound in his arm from combat. But according to the New York Times, public records, and firsthand accounts—including a Navy SEAL who served with Sheehy—his gunshot wound was from accidentally shooting himself in the arm in Glacier National Park. 2. Days later, NBC News released another bombshell report stating Sheehy lied about being “medically discharged” from the Navy. It’s shocking—and Montanans must know the truth but we’re running out of time. So I made the difficult decision to launch more television and digital ads today. The money isn’t in the budget yet—but with polls in the margin of error, running these final ads could be enough to break the tie in Jon’s favor and win this race. I need you to split an immediate donation to help us fund these last-minute ads. How you respond right now could be the difference between winning and losing. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_tester?refcode=jtk5618-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Every time I take a risk on this campaign, it’s because I believe in this team. I’m confident grassroots supporters like you—who’ve stepped up time and time again—will help us win this Senate race. With just 3 days until Election Day, Jon and our team need you now more than ever. Thank you, Shelbi Campaign Manager Team Tester -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Debbie for Florida,Debbie (1 unread),info@e.debbieforflorida.com,re: Trump and Scott,11/2/24 11:36,2024,11,2,11,36,e.debbieforflorida.com,"It's plain to see, friend: Rick Scott is TERRIFIED of our movement — and hehas every reason to be: Based on his all-time-low approval rating at 35%, andKamala Harris now polling within the margin of error against Trump in Florida,it's clear that Florida voters are sick and tired of both the right-wingmovement and its most loyal puppets, like Scott. And it's no coincidence —since his election in 2018, Rick Scott's been nothing more than a rubber stampfor anything and everything Donald Trump wants: * Trump's SCOTUS nominees *Trump's dangerous agenda * Trump's baseless voter fraud claims * Trump'srefusal to certify Biden's victory * Rubber stamp after rubber stamp afterrubber stamp If both Trump and Scott are reelected in November, they couldconspire to move the Supreme Court even further to the right. Scott could bein charge of the Senate as majority leader, and with Trump unchecked by anycriminal culpability for his official acts as president, they could unleashthe most dangerous, extremist agenda yet on the American people. I refuse tolet that happen. Listen, nothing less than our democracy is at stake when itcomes to defeating Rick ""Rubber Stamp"" Scott this November. But just as he didlast time around, Scott is already shelling out millions from his own personalfortune to buy this Senate seat. He's already spent over $38 million on ads todefeat me as polling shows us in a statistical dead heat! Rick Scott isscared, plain and simple. And he should be. He's one of the most vulnerableGOP senators on the ballot, and with your grassroots support, we will defeathim. But I'm still falling short of my LAST $4 MILLION fundraising goal — agoal we MUST hit by Nov. 5. So please, will you help me close this fundraisinggap and fight back by rushing a donation of $5 or more? We can and must defeatRick Scott and Donald Trump, and it's YOUR donation that will make itpossible.

I wanted to send you a quick message while I have my morning coffee. To be honest, asking for donations is my least favorite part of the job. But the truth is it’s absolutely necessary if we’re going to keep Wisconsin blue and defend this seat. Republicans have spent $100 million on ads attacking me and uplifting my opponent. The bad news is, their strategy seems to be working — with multiple polls showing my opponent taking a one-point lead. Losing this seat would cost Democrats control of the Senate. If Eric Hovde secured the majority for Mitch McConnell and the extreme GOP, everything from the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights to Social Security and Medicare would be on the chopping block. We can’t let that happen, but we’re running out of time to stop them. We have three days left to leave it all on the field — get our message in front of the final undecided Wisconinites, turn out voters across the state, and win this toss-up race.

Over the next four days, our team will be knocking thousands of doors, running ads, and trying to reach as many New Hampshire voters as possible. I’m about to ask you to chip in to power our campaign through Tuesday, but first, I want to explain the impact your donation will have. 👊 $2 buys a water bottle for door knocking volunteers 📱 $4 allows us to make more calls + send more texts 🪧 $5 helps supply new yard signs 📺 $10 keeps our ads on the air 🏃 $25 allows us to compete with Kelly Ayotte’s millionaire donors While my opponents solicit millions from extreme MAGA supporters and self-fund their campaigns, we rely on grassroots donations from folks chipping in a dollar or two at a time. So, Peter, can you help power our campaign through the Tuesday election by chipping in $ today?

Not just because he’s a member of Congress, or because he served as an impeachment manager in the case against Donald Trump, or on the January 6th Committee — though I am proud of him for all of those things! I admire my dad because he is tireless and relentless in his work to make a difference for others — especially young people like me and my brother Eli. Whether he’s fighting to reform the Supreme Court so my generation is not beholden to an ultra-conservative judiciary, or fighting to cancel student loan debt, or fighting to restore reproductive rights, or fighting to protect our clean air and water, he’s taking on big fights to help other people out. My dad is one of the most selfless people I know. Growing up, I would watch him at campaign events, asking people over and over again how he could help and hearing about their struggles. For most people, it would probably be exhausting and quite challenging — especially when the former president of the United States is always demonizing you. But my dad has never wavered in his work to make real change. For your grandma, your neighbor down the street who is a veteran, your teacher, your kids and grandkids, for everyone. And that’s why I know he’s going to be a damn good Senator. We have just a few days left to make it happen, which is why I’m earnestly asking you, Derek: [ https://act.adamschiff.com/go/2907?c0=nov2024_abs_em.SALZ0e&refcode;=AU_ABS_FR_GEN_GEN_AC90_20241102_AM1_V1_S1&email;=&t;=1004&akid;=8094%2E5257348%2El9CHG9 ]Will you help send my dad to the U.S. Senate?

Steve Garvey outraised our campaignagain. For the third fundraising period in a row.

Every day we letpass without responding to Garvey’s fundraising numbers is another opportunityfor him to reach undecided voters in the California Senate race — and moreMAGA candidates to press their advantage down-ballot. The implications gobeyond just our race: If Garvey turns out GOP voters, we are putting injeopardy the half-dozen toss-up House races in California that could determinethe House majority. We can’t count out Republican candidates in California. Wesimply can’t. Steve Garvey has outraised our campaign over the last threefundraising reporting periods. But we still have time to beat him right now,when it matters most. That’s why I’m urgently asking: Can you pitch in a splitdonation of $10 or any amount between Fight for Reform to elect state andlocal Democrats and my campaign to help us shift the momentum back in ourfavor?

A generous group of donors just agreed to match all donationsuntil the end of the day—so anything you can give will go twice as far.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/james-for-ny-24-tester?refcode=jtk1722-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Give me a minuteto explain why this fight is personal to me, Peter. This race is between awealthy outsider who wants to privatize and destroy our health care system,end protections for public lands, and make personal health care decisions forwomen—and me, someone who was born and raised here and will fight like hellfor our Montana values. But I’m up against nearly $90 million in spending fromMitch McConnell’s buddies. We’re being pummeled by their attacks—and if wedon’t act now, that spending could be enough to tip the race into Tim Sheehy’sfavor. Look, I’m no stranger to tough fights—I won my first Senate race byless than 1 percentage point. But my back is up against the wall, and the onlyway we’ll win is through your support. If you’ve been waiting for the besttime to give, it’s right now: Generous donors are matching all gifts untilmidnight to help us win this race—so don’t wait. Will you split $5 (becomes$10) between my campaign and Letitia James' before midnight to help me win themost competitive Senate race in the country? All of our work has led up tothis moment. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/james-for-ny-24-tester?refcode=jtk1722-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you, Jon-------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

I grew up ina working-class neighborhood in mid-Missouri. It was one of those places wherethe curbs crumbled into the streets and the sidewalks were so tilted youcouldn’t really walk on them — though they made a pretty good bike ramp forall of us kids. We all ran in and out of each other’s houses, everyone’sparents took care of everyone. It was a magical place to live. Like so manyfamilies, mine lived paycheck-to-paycheck — and when my littlest sister wasborn with a heart condition, we were bankrupted by medical bills. Our familygot by thanks to the generosity of our community — most people had no moremoney than we did, but helped us anyway. Our neighbors and friends took therest of us kids into their homes while my parents were with my sister at thehospital over 100 miles away. And when we were all home together, they broughtmore meals by the house than we could ever hope to eat. Their support helpedme go to college, and after that I joined the Marines to honor everything ourcommunity did for me and my family growing up. But when I came home betweentours in Iraq and Afghanistan, I found that old magical place picked for parts— our local corner store was boarded up, our family’s first home in theneighborhood was bulldozed to the ground. Now it’s an empty lot: [https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/83260?refcode=em20241102-8603&firstname;=Peter&lastname;=Willis&email;=dpwillis67@gmail.com&zip;=18326&city;=Cresco&state;=PA&amounts;=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t;=1002&akid;=8603%2E614464%2Ep6dHnE]Photo of empty lot in Jefferson City where Lucas' childhood home once stood.While all of us were risking our lives to build up towns like Habbaniyah,Fallujah, and Herat, career politicians and corporate elites like Josh Hawleylet our towns and neighborhoods at home waste away.

While her opponent doubles down on Trump’s extreme anddivisive policies that are out of step with voters, Maggie remains focused onbringing our community together to defend our fundamental freedoms, protectour democracy, and secure a fair deal for ALL Granite Staters. Maggie’sopponent has pushed Trump's baseless lies and conspiracies surrounding the2020 election, which have been used to restrict voting rights here in NewHampshire. If that wasn’t extreme enough, she’s refused to confirm whether ornot she would certify the 2024 election results if elected to Congress. Withcontrol of the People’s House on the line, we can’t afford to let this openseat fall into the hands of MAGA extremists who are willing to thwart ourdemocracy and bail Trump out!

With only 3 daysleft until Election Day, we have an exciting opportunity to make a differencein the abortion ban state of TN and ensure Allie can be in the rooms to serveas a much-needed pro-choice woman’s voice. Rush a split $20.24 or morecontribution between Her Bold Move and Allie’s campaign TODAY to join thefight. → https://secure.actblue.com/donate/hbm-phillips/?refcode=EM_F_241102room__N_ASR_90DO_12_G_N_PT Last year, during aroutine anatomy scan at 19 weeks pregnant, Allie received the devastating newsthat the baby she was joyfully expecting, Miley Rose, was not going to makeit. Following the diagnosis, Doctors warned that continuing the pregnancywould endanger Allie’s life. But, the Tennessee state legislature, which is85% male, had passed a near-total ban on abortion in 2022. She was forced toleave her home state, devastated and heartbroken, to obtain the life-savingcare she needed: “With a risk of sepsis, blood clots, or more, I underwent anemergency abortion. I did this alone: in a city I had never been to before,without my family or my husband there by my side,” Allie said. After thishorrible, tragic experience, Allie began advocating for a new policy shetitled “Miley’s Law,” which would add an exception for fetal anomalies to herstate’s abortion ban. However, her legislator, Rep. Jeff Burkhart, did nothave any empathy for her experience. He told her that if his own daughter hadbeen in her position, he’d have wanted her to continue the pregnancy… he alsotold her “most of the time the pregnancies that go bad are usually the firstpregnancy.” (???) It’s way past time we elect legislators, not mansplainerswho have no idea what they’re talking about. Betches News recently publishedthe audio from that conversation, “In recently unearthed audio from June 2023,Republican Tennessee representative Jeff Burkhart is heard speaking to twowomen who had lost pregnancies. In the conversation he actively tried toinvalidate their experiences because of his own misinformed understanding ofreproductive health. Almost a year earlier, a ban on abortion from the pointof conception with zero exceptions went into effect in Tennessee.” After theconversation, Phillips wrote to Buckhart and said, “Every chance I get to tellmy story, I will… Who knows, maybe one day I’ll run against you.” Now Allie isrunning for HIS SEAT in the TN House of Representatives – and she is withinstriking distance of actually winning it – but she needs our help. This is arare opportunity to replace an anti-choice extremist legislator in TN, and weare honored to be standing with Allie in this fight.

So as theactor and activist who played that former president on TV, I ask the samequestion of you now, friend: What's next when it comes to your support of oneof the most important Senate races in the country? I'm talking about DemocratDebbie Mucarsel-Powell's campaign to defeat Rick Scott in Florida and protectour Democratic Senate majority. Just recently, Debbie narrowed the polling gapbetween her and Rick Scott to just 2 points. Then the experts at InsideElections increased her chances of defeating Rick Scott. So what's next,friend? Well, with your immediate grassroots donation, Debbie wins. That iswhat's next.

From supporting the farm worker movement withCesar Chavez in California to campaigning for Ted Kennedy's presidentialcampaign in Florida (yes, Florida!) to supporting Democratic Senatecandidates, I've never been shy about getting involved and fighting for what'sright. Fighting for what's right most usually demands articulating what iswrong. And Florida's GOP senator Rick Scott — who is beholden to Donald Trump— is absolutely wrong for Florida and our nation. A Republican majority in theSenate, with Donald Trump in the White House, is downright wrong and dangerousfor our nation. You know it as well as I do. Trump and Scott are beholden toan extreme ideology that attacks the heart of our nation — our freedom anddemocracy — while empowering and enriching themselves and their allies. Theiragenda wouldn't just send our nation backward, but it would also cause untoldharm. That's why I'm all in to help Debbie Mucarsel-Powell win in Florida. Ifwe win in Florida, Democrats hold the Senate. If we win in Florida, we stopDonald Trump. If we win in Florida, the ""what's next?"" is building a countrywith new, hopeful ideas and possibilities.

A reckoning is approaching. Hey friends - this is JohnRich. I'm proud to be a thorn in the side of the woke Left. Here's the thing.I've been singing and writing country music since before the word ""woke"" waseven a thing. I grew up in the South and was raised to be a freedom-lovingpatriot who always stands for the flag, protects the Second Amendment,supports our troops, and backs the blue. And that's why it makes me absolutelysick to see what the liberal whack jobs have done to our country, and whatthey have in store for our future. They want to redefine what it means to bean American. They won't stop until ""one nation under God"" is stripped from ourPledge of Allegiance. They are eager to parade drag queens through ourchildren's classrooms. They won't sleep until the U.S. Constitution isshredded to bits. It's an utter disgrace, but I find peace knowing that ""theLord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming."" It also doesn'thurt that we have patriots like Senator Marsha Blackburn fighting the goodfight for us in the U.S. Senate.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=b92d85a9778a6af9c4d56fbab9155cfbad4f420c998df4df1d983c9fb236ba284331617beb4f8d638e6d3edcdcdcf96facaf909453f9fd8d708adbf2184b5a4fThat's actually why I'm emailing you today. Chuck Schumer and his socialistcronies in Washington are propping up radical socialists to destroy MarshaBlackburn and PERMANENTLY take over Tennessee. They will spend, lie, and cheattheir way to victory unless we do something about it right here and now. Weneed a response that will leave Marsha's opponents regretting they everentered the ring.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=b92d85a9778a6af9c4d56fbab9155cfbad4f420c998df4df1d983c9fb236ba284331617beb4f8d638e6d3edcdcdcf96facaf909453f9fd8d708adbf2184b5a4fSo, I'm directly asking you to join me in supporting her campaign. SenatorMarsha Blackburn is as tough as they come. She's never given an inch to thewoke mob, and she is a God-fearing patriot like you and me. Marsha has mycomplete backing, and I hope you're willing to give her the same. I don'twrite emails like this ever, so trust me when I tell you that Marsha Blackburnneeds your support today to defeat her opponents and all the commie lovingLiberals hell-bent on destroying America. If they take Tennessee, the battleis over. We'd never recover.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=b92d85a9778a6af9c4d56fbab9155cfbad4f420c998df4df1d983c9fb236ba284331617beb4f8d638e6d3edcdcdcf96facaf909453f9fd8d708adbf2184b5a4fI'm asking this as a personal favor to a fellow Patriot: please don't closethis email without taking a moment to support Marsha Blackburn's campaign.

After hearing Kamala Harris and Donald Trump present their cases to the American people over the last few months, one thing is clear: Harris is in this for hardworking American families, and Trump is in this to advance his political career and line his own pockets. Harris has proved that she's committed to expanding affordable health care, investing in our nation's economy, restoring reproductive rights and more. Donald Trump can't say the same — he's only shown that he's willing to do whatever it takes to divide our country.

We’ve been out on the Campaigntrail for almost a year and now it is time to take action at the ballot box.We need your support so please get out and vote. We are three days from theMain Event - For us it is a David v. Goliath story. We have been identifyingand posing solutions to issues facing the citizens of this district and willcontinue to do so and we have been working with the local candidates OurCampaign has been one about Federal Solutions to Local Problems that you and Iface living in the Constitution State of Connecticut. We have also looked atworld issues and issues that need to be addressed in Congress especially onglobal energy and reduced global emissions (See Article [https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/40db40d4-519f-4190-ae65-7e32a8d5227b?j=eyJ1IjoiMWh2cjYwIn0.VBabVq-VHATXCJqsddI7uMpdiTm0WkVanRDZfvCWMkg ]). We’ve been out there: knocking doors,talking to people at Garbage dumps (long before we were called garbage),talking to you, marching in parades, talking to our youth, our veterans,talking to communities that have been ignored. We have also spent a lot oftime talking to people in the supermarkets about their pocketbook issues. Wehave a pretty good feeling of the pulse of this State and this Country. Hereare some of the issues that matter to Every Day Nutmeggers like You.Connecticut has a border crisis. Immigration and bad economic policy isaffecting everyone and causes rampant inflation. The fentanyl and traffickingmaking its way to our backyard must stop. At the grocery stores, many peopleare waiting to shop on sale days and many are shopping at multiplesupermarkets to take advantages of different sales. The sales price ofgroceries today were the regular prices under the Trump administration. Thereis no price gouging at supermarkets as they typically run on less than a 2%profit margin and high volume. They are struggling due to high energy costs,supply chain issues, and theft. Crime is rampant and our police need to besupported and this mantra of Crime Pays Under Harris and Himes needs to bereversed. Education - Parents want to be able to send their children wherethey want and we have been advocating for school choice. When we marched thePuerto Rican Day parade, so many parents expressed the challenges of workingtwo or three jobs to be in a position to send their children to private orparochial schools because Bridgeport ranks at the bottom of the schooldistricts of 161 out of about 165. (See our article on Your Child, YourChoice. [ https://open.substack.com/pub/drmichaelgoldstein4ct/p/your-child-your-choice?r=26c3ku&utm;_campaign=post&utm;_medium=web ]) Housing is anothermajor issue and not just 8-30g. Rents keep going up and the supply of housingis an issue in some parts of our district. Pricing is going up forinflationary reasons as cost of home heating is up. Cost of electricity is up.Cost of insurance is up. Hartford keeps jamming 8–30g down our throats. Thismandate does not solve the real problem, which is enough affordable ownershipof housing. Our children cannot afford to live in Fairfield County.

We Need a Return to Local Control andAffordable Home Ownership and Building Equity.

Business - Companies are moving out ofConnecticut. The only companies that come here are doing so because they haveto. When they get here, they are stuck in traffic because I-95 doesn’t move -You can blame Himes for that one - See our article - When you Are Stuck onI-95 - Blame Himes) [https://open.substack.com/pub/drmichaelgoldstein4ct/p/i-95-when-you-are-in-traffic-blame?r=26c3ku&utm;_campaign=post&utm;_medium=web ]. Thisinfrastructure and energy crisis is causing issues to Commercial Real EstateConcerns and we need to bring more jobs to Connecticut with new pro-businessstrategies including: reduced regulatory burdens, expedited zoning and permitapprovals, improving the infrastructure with less congested highways andimproved commuter rail service. Federal tax incentives and opportunity zonesare tools that can be used to attract new businesses to our beautiful state.These are techniques being used by other states to lure away Connecticutbusinesses. We need to be more aggressive in both attracting and keepingbusinesses here. (See our Article on Addressing our Commercial Markets [https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/6daa23f1-9e4e-44d9-8658-35fbc3680cff?j=eyJ1IjoiMWh2cjYwIn0.VBabVq-VHATXCJqsddI7uMpdiTm0WkVanRDZfvCWMkg ]). I-95 - It needs solutions and somework is being done. Our new concern is that the roads are being improved bycontractors not from Connecticut - We have to try and keep jobs here and keepthe money in Connecticut that will flow into Connecticut. We launched aninquiry after you complained about New York license plates on the constructionvehicles (see article [https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/8046dcc5-feaf-43a7-8651-cd3b2a09611c?j=eyJ1IjoiMWh2cjYwIn0.VBabVq-VHATXCJqsddI7uMpdiTm0WkVanRDZfvCWMkg ]). Electricity - As for electricity, ourbills have gone up significantly because of the public benefit. The electriccompany should pay for these green initiatives which benefits them by reducingtheir need to supply additional electricity. You are not obligated to helpyour neighbor make improvements in a classic taxation without representation.In the interim, I have proposed a deduction on your taxes for this mandatewhile you push your local State Reps and Senators to push back.

Israel - Harrisand Himes have been terrible on Israel despite the fact Jim Himes largestdonor is AIPAC.

That was their first mission since October 7.(See our Article on Biden and Harris Snub Israe [https://open.substack.com/pub/drmichaelgoldstein4ct/p/biden-and-harris-snub-israel?r=26c3ku&utm;_campaign=post&utm;_medium=web ]l) .

National Democratic Redistricting Committee,NDRC HQ,info@democraticredistricting.com,Sabato’s Crystal Ball: 6 new toss-ups,11/2/24 14:06,2024,11,2,14,6,democraticredistricting.com,"A top analyst at Sabato’s Crystal Ball — one of the premier election-forecasting organizations in the country — rated six legislative chambers as“TOSS-UPS” in our priority states. Peter, this is a BIG deal. A toss-up meansit’s anyone’s game. Rush a $30 donation to the NDRC in these final days andhelp turn these “TOSS-UP” chambers into wins for fair maps. State legislativeraces are often decided by just a few hundred votes, so a contribution of anyamount can make a measurable difference in the outcomes.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_TossUps_email_20241102-NDRC-Tier1-TossUps_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241102-NDRC-Tier1-TossUps_&utm;_campaign=TossUps&amount;=30] These “toss-ups” include bothchambers in the Arizona legislature, the New Hampshire State House, theMichigan State House, the Minnesota State House, and the Pennsylvania StateHouse. Here’s a quick analysis of what’s at stake in each state: ➡️ Arizona:Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of the Arizona legislature, butif we flip just two seats in each, we can flip both the state house and statesenate and strengthen the state’s redistricting process. ➡️ Michigan: WhileDemocrats hold a trifecta in Michigan, Republicans are vying to take back thestate house this November. If they do, they could attempt to roll backprogress on fair maps by targeting the state’s independent redistrictingcommission. ➡️ Minnesota: Democrats won a surprise trifecta of their state’sgovernment in 2022, but this year, only the state house is on the ballot.Republicans need to flip just five seats to win back control and block all theamazing progress we’ve seen there in the last two years. ➡️ New Hampshire:It’s the Republicans who hold a trifecta in New Hampshire — and since mid-cycle congressional redistricting is permitted in this state, the GOP coulduse their power to rewrite their maps at any given moment. (The Republicancandidate for governor has even said they hope to do so.) Democrats need towin the legislature to put an end to the possibility of mid-cycle GOPgerrymandering. ➡️ Pennsylvania: Democrats hold the state house and thegovernor’s seat, but Republicans control the state senate. If we can protectthe state house majority and flip the state senate, we will achieve anotherDemocratic trifecta and have the ability to enact redistricting reform inPennsylvania. These are races that are critical to the long-term fight forfairness — and being successful in these elections could help lay thefoundation for an even fairer redistricting process in 2031. With just 3 daysuntil the final votes are cast, we need a surge of support to fund our work toelect Democracy Defenders across the country and help keep the fair mapsmovement moving forward.

Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can’t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don’t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day. So our kids grow up in democracy, not dystopia. Thank you for your support for all we do!

Here's an article that I wrote a couple yearsback explaining that ""wokeism"" is not a value that Latinos appreciate.https://townhall.com/campaign-voices/peterhernandez/2022/08/31/wokeism-is-not-a-latino-value-n2612437 ""Wokeism in its purest forms breaks down clarity, andreplaces truth with new grievance norms that masquerade as justice. Wokeiststry to negate centuries of tradition, culture and science (!) by sociallyshaming opposing views and using coercive tactics on young children to adoptconcepts that go against every grain of common sense and human understandingof the world around us. Woke gender ideology, being so totally antithetical tothe Latino language and culture, plays a huge part of why Hispanics areuniversally turning away from the Democrat party."" ""Now the left wants toreplace Latino with ‘Latinx.’ It is the woke objective to erase gender bychanging the masculine default of Spanish plural words: canceling the ‘os’ atthe end of words by replacing it with an X. The gender confusion communityseeks to do whatever it can to remove the uniqueness and importance ofmasculine and feminine in our culture, and in our language. Are we to begin tocall our sons and daughters by ninx rather than nina or nino, ourgrandchildren nietx, our students alumnx, our friends amigx, our neighborsvecinx, and our partners companerx? We must end this abuse of language andstop the disrespect of our masculine and feminine natures. Let’s maintain theproud heritage of the Spanish language which has existed for more than twomillennia."" Click the image to read the whole article. Let me know what youthink.

I just personally reviewed brand-new polling that shows Rick Scott statistically DEADLOCKED with his Democratic opponent, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.

And look, there’s no shortage of competition for wacko GOP senators. But Rick Scott may take the cake. He wrote the plan to END Social Security and Medicare. He wants to raise taxes on working families to give megamillionaires (like himself) a tax cut.

Watching my parents work hard tosupport our family and care for others taught me the value of service. That’sexactly why I became a pediatrician. But I quickly realized that doctors facemajor obstacles when trying to treat our patients. That’s why I ran for thestate legislature. In that time, I worked to pass legislation to force drugcompanies to lower the cost of prescriptions, expand funding for preschool,ensure all Coloradans have access to paid family leave and sick days, andprotect renters from eviction during the pandemic. And, Peter, that’s why Iran for Congress in 2022. The pollsters said I didn’t have a shot at winningthis race. Thanks to this grassroots movement, we defied the odds and electedthe first Latina to represent Colorado in Congress. I’m ready to continueadvocating for Coloradans in Congress, but I can’t get there alone. Yoursupport was critical last time, and with just three days until Election Day,we need all hands on deck.

I know a few things about winning elections here in California, so I want to give you a peek behind the scenes on where things stand: First, here’s what’s at stake: Political analysts, the media, and even *Republicans* themselves agree that control of the U.S. House is likely to come down to California in this election. And now, new polling shows Democrats taking the lead in the “must-win” swing seats . But the one thing that can trip us up now, is not having the resources needed to seal the deal and flip these districts. That’s why I’m asking you to make a special donation to the California Democratic Party’s Swing Seat Fund so that we can deploy organizers, keep regional offices open later, print more literature, organize more canvases, and more. Will you pitch in?

This is more tossup seats than ANY other state in the country. And across these seats, polling shows Democrats taking the momentum . With these swing districts in California *alone*, Democrats can retake the U.S. House and fire Speaker Mike Johnson. But the problem is that because the media has been so focused on the buzzy swing states in the presidential contest, Democrats have not been paying attention to California and our make-or-break role in the battle for U.S. House control. We need to shift into high gear and ensure all these competitive districts have the resources needed to flip blue next week. That’s why I am personally asking you to make a special gift of $ or more.

After giving nearly $75 million to a super PAC supporting Donald Trump, Elon Musk has been using me to spread right-wing misinformation about elections in Michigan. He invoked my image to stoke his conspiracies and lay the groundwork to disenfranchise Michigan voters if he and other Trump Republicans don’t like the result of this election. Look, we know exactly what Elon is trying to accomplish. The road to the White House runs through Michigan, and he’s doing whatever he can to confuse voters and muddy the waters to give Donald Trump a better chance of winning our 15 electoral votes. Michiganders are voting right now, so we need to act fast to combat this right-wing misinformation. I’ve always done everything I can to keep our elections free, fair, and accessible to everyone who is eligible to cast a ballot. And I won’t stop now. Will you help make sure my team and I have the resources we need to counter Elon Musk’s disinformation and continue getting out the vote?

That’s who he is. But America, I am here tonight to say: That’s not who we are,” Harris said. “I pledge to be a president for all Americans — to always put country above party and above self.” The difference couldn’t be any clearer, team. One candidate who uses inflammatory rhetoric, who has sworn revenge on his political enemies, and has vowed to defund entire departments of the executive branch to pay for tax breaks for his wealthy friends. And another who is choosing hope over fear, country over party, and is leading a way forward based in hope and fighting for our freedoms. Vice President Harris has a plan that invests in America’s future and builds our economy from the bottom up and the middle out. With just three days left, will you pitch in $3 or more right now to help us elect Vice President Harris in the 13th District?

Living across fromTrump's Golf Course, I had to see a reminder every day of how easily and oftenour government supports and enables the ultra-wealthy at the expense ofworking families. You see, the New York City government shoveled over $100million in government aid to develop this golf course with Donald Trump andthe corrupt Trump Organization. They did this while New York families likemine lived in hunger and poverty across the street. But, I always try to lookat the positives — growing up smelling the stench of Donald Trump (even beforehe became president) has led me to where I am today: Fighting in Congress forjustice for real working families. When I work on legislation, I always thinkabout the families who are struggling just like mine did. I lived thatexperience — it is not abstract to me. And I'll never forget it. I hope youfeel like you have a better sense of who I am and what my values are. I swearthat I'm fighting for those values every day in Congress. Right now, theshadow of Trump and his MAGA cult looms large. They're determined to strip ourright to vote, give tax breaks to people like Trump, and put special interestsahead of working families – and they’re raising millions to pull it off. Butwe have something they don’t, Peter: A powerful grassroots movement made up ofworking people, not faceless corporations.

Thanks to thisgrassroots team, we've been running ads across Florida in English and Spanish— and based on the numbers shared in our team meeting this morning, they areworking. The first week they aired, I shot up 3 points in the polls. Now, I'mLESS THAN 2 POINTS AWAY from taking Rick Scott's dwindling lead altogether.But actually clinching the lead means not only keeping my ads on the air butalso launching new ones — and based on the metrics shown in that same meeting,our fundraising numbers just hit a 30-day low: Without your help to close the52% gap on my LAST $4 million goal and keep funding my ads until Election Day,we risk losing all the momentum we've gained so far. Will you please give $5now to keep me on track to flip Florida blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2481-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 With just 72 hours until voters head to theballot box — amid reports that Rick Scott dumped another $10.5 MILLION tofurther blanket the airwaves with his own ads — this slowdown couldn't havecome at a worse time: * If grassroots donations stay on a downward trend, Iwon't have the funds to keep the ads we're airing on TV. * If I can't affordto keep my ads in front of Florida voters, my filthy-rich opponent will easilybuy up all the slots we'd be leaving on the table. * If Scott drowns out ourmessage with ads smearing me in this last leg of the race, there's no chancewe'll make a comeback in time for Election Day. That is, friend, unless I cancount on your help to stop the bleeding and meet my final $4 million goal. Inever would've entered striking distance of Rick Scott without your help, andI won't be able to overtake him in these final hours without you. Please,friend, will you rush $5, $25, or anything you can spare now to keep mecompetitive in the race to retire Rick and flip this Senate seat blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2481-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for everything, Debbie -------- Thisemail was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

That’s why I’ve been barnstorming the state and sending so many emailsasking for help. I truly appreciate all you’ve done to support my campaign.But I still need help-this race is still too close! Why is my race so close?Unfortunately, one reason is that my opponent Colin Allred is untruthful, andis attempting to hide his radical liberal views from Texas voters. It takes alot of time and money to set the record straight… For example, on the borderAllred now claims to love border security, and belatedly says he wants to finda solution to the Biden-Harris border crisis, but that’s not how Allred votedin Congress… In Congress, Allred was an Open Borders Radical who voted AGAINSTthe interests of Texas and FOR open borders lawlessness numerous times: Allredvoted AGAINST the Secure the Border Act. Allred voted AGAINST denouncing theBiden Administration’s immigration policies. Allred voted AGAINST condemningthe Biden border crisis and the tremendous burdens law enforcement officersface as a result. Allred voted AGAINST the POLICE Act, which would immediatelydeport any illegal alien who assaults a law enforcement officer. Allred votedAGAINST the SAVE Act, which was a bill that would block illegal aliens fromvoting in U.S. elections. And perhaps most shamefully, Allred SKIPPED a voteon the End the Border Catastrophe Act… It takes a lot of time and money to setthe record straight…and of course the liberal media is working overtime tohelp Allred hide his record.

November 5th isdays away, and I’d really appreciate the chance toexplain why this request — especially today — is so critically important.Here’s the truth: Right now, we have a week of media buys to pay for — themost important week of the entire campaign. And if we don’t raise what we neednow, we will be forced to give up the airwaves and let Adam Schiff and theDemocrat-machine backing him up run their attacks on me unopposed. Whatmatters most right now is that we do whatever we can to fund a campaign thatcan win. That’s the most important thing. Winning this race. Not just for thesake of winning, but because of what it would mean to substitute my presencewith Adam Schiff’s in the Senate. That’s a reality I don’t think any of uswant to consider, but it’s what will happen if we come up short. Now, time isrunning out.

[https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/33436?t=1011&amount;=25&akid;=3181%2E52803%2E7kOuRk]Donate I want to outline our campaign's message to fill Maryland’s open U.S.Senate seat. It hinges on 3 major components: Power to the People Thiscampaign has never been about me, Peter. It’s always been about Marylanders,our families, and our communities. And when Republican Larry Hogan entered therace putting our Democratic Senate majority at risk, it became about thefuture of the entire country. That’s why Republicans are pouring millions ofdollars into this race. But during the Democratic Primary, we proved thatMaryland is won by the many, not by the money. We’ve never had limitlessresources, million dollar checks, or shady dark money super PACs pulling thestrings. Instead, we built a grassroots coalition of people in every corner ofthe state who stepped up to volunteer, donate, and talk to their neighborsabout our campaign. Your time and your contributions were the driving forcebehind our primary victory, and we need to continue building on that in orderto win on Tuesday. Focus on the Issues that Matter While Republicans arelining up to get behind Donald Trump and his divisive MAGA agenda, we'refocusing on the issues that matter most to people — like protecting abortionrights, improving wages, and preserving our democracy. My Republican opponentLarry Hogan hopes Marylanders won’t remember that as governor, he vetoedlegislation that would have expanded access to abortion care throughout thestate. He’s banking on Marylanders forgetting that he vetoed a $15 minimumwage and legislation to benefit unions and workers. He’s hoping Marylanderswon’t realize that electing him means handing control of the Senate over toextremists like Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham. On the issues that matter most,Hogan’s record speaks for itself: He’s all wrong for Maryland, and he’ll sayand do whatever he thinks will win him this seat. Make the Case for aDemocratic Senate Majority Here’s the truth, Peter: There simply isn’t any wayDemocrats maintain our razor-thin Senate majority if Larry Hogan wins thisopen seat. Mitch McConnell handpicked Hogan for this race because he seesMaryland as his best chance to flip a seat, retake the majority, and enact hisfar-right, anti-choice agenda. If the GOP retakes the Senate, they'll have thepower to pass a national abortion ban, roll back environmental protections,undermine our elections, and so much more. Hogan has proven that he cannot betrusted to protect our reproductive rights or put Maryland families first.Defending the Senate is the only way to protect our freedoms, uplift workingfamilies, and preserve our democracy. We’ve got a winning message that’sresonating with voters, Peter, and I need your support to make sure everyonehears it.

Regardless of the outcome, it's clear that ourcountry is divided and in desperate need of new leaders who can unify everydaypeople across our shared priorities and against our shared enemies:corporations, billionaires, and right-wing extremists. Everyday people don'tsee any party fighting for their interests anymore.

InsiderAdvantage — October 2024 Eric Hovde (R): 49% [+1] Tammy Baldwin (D): 48% Ever since Eric Hovde closed the polling gap in this race, Republicans see Wisconsin as one of their best opportunities to flip a Democrat-held Senate seat red. That’s why Hovde, Mitch McConnell, and their right-wing allies have poured $100 million into Wisconsin to defeat Tammy. Tammy’s opponent is surging at the worst possible time. Early and absentee voting is well underway. More than one million votes have already been cast, and we’re running out of time to get our message in front of voters before polls close in just three days. Wisconsin elections always come down to the wire and this race is looking no different — which means every dollar matters in our final voter outreach efforts.

In Texas, thelaw provides prison for life, for healthcare providers, for doing what theybelieve is in the best interest of their patient. In some counties in Texas,they have passed travel bans to prevent women from going to other states toreceive care. These are the stakes — and we know how we got here. ” She’sright — we do know how we got here: In 2021, Texas completely banned abortionwith very limited exceptions. Then, the Texas Supreme Court then ruled that awoman did not qualify for an abortion under the state’s medical exceptiondespite the fact that her doctor determined she needed the procedure to saveher life. That decision forced a pregnant woman to travel out of state toreceive the care she needed to save her life. The justices doubled down onthat extreme decision this year, ruling against 20 women who said they weredenied the ability to receive medically necessary abortions as a result of thestate’s extreme abortion ban. This is unconscionable, Peter — and we won’t siton the sidelines while elected state supreme court justices rip away people’srights. The NDRC is proud to have endorsed Judge DaSean Jones, Judge ChristineWeems, and Judge Bonnie Lee Goldstein for the Texas Supreme Court because oftheir commitment to be fair-minded, conduct an independent evaluation of thelaw, ensuring rights and protecting freedoms.

Five Fun Facts about Voting & Elections Absentee Voting:Must Be More than Two Miles from Home Pennsylvania was the first state toallow absentee voting during the War of 1812, but you had to be at least twomiles from home! Bring Your Own Ballot (BYOB?) It wasn’t until the election of1888 that ballots became standardized in the U.S. Before then, voters oftenbrought ballots passed out by political parties or wrote down their choices.Astronauts Can Vote from Space Thanks to a Texas law passed in 1997,astronauts can cast their votes from space. Using a secure ballot, NASAensures astronauts are never left out, even when orbiting the Earth. WhyTuesday? Why November? Tuesday was selected to avoid Sundays (for church) andWednesdays (market days for farmers). November was chosen because it was afterthe harvest season and before the harsh winter weather. Voting Wasn’t AlwaysSecret Before the 1890s, there was nothing secret about voting. In fact, atthat time, many people believed voting should be a public act.

And I'm reaching out personally to ask youto join me in supporting Sherrod today. Most people don't know I grew up inSpringfield, Ohio. My mom was a seamstress and my dad was a factory worker,and I saw up close how hard they worked to support our family. That's why Ibelieve in what Sherrod calls the Dignity of Work – the idea that hard workshould pay off for everyone – and why I'm personally asking: Will you give $5to help Sherrod win reelection and keep the Senate blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?refcode=jtk3797-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 So much is on the linein Ohio. Senate control will be determined by Sherrod's race, so we must standtogether to protect reproductive rights, defend Social Security and Medicare,and save our democracy. This race is going to be tight. Polls show Sherrodnarrowly trailing his Trump-backed opponent, and political experts have calledSherrod one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection. Republicanswill do anything to defeat Sherrod, and they've outspent him 3-to-1 to attackhim relentlessly. That's why I had to reach out, friend. Sherrod needs ourgrassroots support right away: Will you chip in $5 or $25 to help Sherrod winin Ohio and keep the Senate blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?refcode=jtk3797-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Ohio means a lot to me,and the working families there – and across America – deserve to have Sherrodin the U.S. Senate.

But thousands of Kansans had one less kitchen table bill to worryabout. When the bipartisan infrastructure law I fought for finally passed, myname didn’t trend on Twitter.

And in the final weekbefore Election Day it seems like everyone is looking at CA-45: First,POLITICO wrote that the road to the House majority lies directly through thisdistrict. Then, Derek went on MSNBC to discuss the state of the race –including Donald Trump’s endorsement of Michelle Steel. And now, The New YorkTimes profiled our race, noting that this race could come down to supporterslike you. Experts have this race as a 50-50 total toss-up… so all eyes are onus, team. There’s a reason GOP mega-donors are flooding this race with darkmoney– we have a real chance to flip this seat and the House in less than oneweek.

I love this country - but right now, it’s taken adark turn. Now, the knocks are coming from Joe Biden’s Department of Justice.Sending two dozen armed agents to arrest a pro-life activist in front of hisfamily.

Voter Protection Project,Jon Tester,info@e.protectvoting.org,grounded,11/2/24 17:38,2024,11,2,17,38,e.protectvoting.org,"Can I tell you a story about my family farm, folks?(https://act.protectvoting.org/go/83981?t=1002&akid;=17887%2E878179%2EtbMk5w)In 1910, my grandfather came to Montana. He found a piece of grassy land, tooka look at it, and said, “This is the place.” And that’s where the farm began.He farmed the land until the early 1940s, and then passed it down to my folks.In 1978, my wife Sharla and I took over the farm and we’re still here today,three generations and more than 40 years later. We’ve made a lot of progresshere — Sharla and I built a new home, several steel buildings, and morestorage. The truth is, I love this work. Yes, it makes for early mornings andlate nights during planting and harvest seasons — but it also keeps megrounded, and it gives me perspective on the issues we face every day. When Ithink about climate change, I’m thinking of folks on farms like mine,struggling with catastrophic droughts or historic levels of flooding. When Ithink about reforming the USPS, I’m thinking of the people in ruralcommunities across Montana who rely on timely mail delivery for theirmedication or Social Security checks. And when I think about infrastructure,I’m thinking of the rural towns near mine that need access to affordable,high-speed internet. These aren’t abstract issues or talking points. They’revery real challenges that deserve real solutions, and that’s what I’m fightingfor in Washington. I spend every single day trying to do right by workingfamilies, farmers, students, and veterans here in Montana and across thecountry. I’m running for reelection because there’s still work to be done.Just like my parents and grandparents on the family farm, when I commit tosomething, I see it through. Can you make a split donation of any amount todaybetween my campaign and Voter Protection Project to help me keep up the fightin Washington?(https://act.protectvoting.org/go/83981?t=1003&akid;=17887%2E878179%2EtbMk5w)I’ll leave you with one last truth about farming: Some years you get the rightamount of rain, and things work out really well. Other years, you get a wholelot less. That means it’s important to be prepared for any outcome, and tohave a support system by your side when things get difficult. We don’t knowwhat this campaign will look like, or what Republicans will throw our way overthese final few months. But with your support, we’ll be ready. I appreciateanything you’re able to pitch in. Thanks for your help, and I hope I make youproud. — Jon ------------------ Paid for by Voter Protection Projectwww.protectvoting.org Not authorized by any candidate or candidate'scommittee. 401 2nd Ave. S, Ste. 303, Seattle, WA 98104 Click here to requestfewer emails: https://act.protectvoting.org/signup/fewer-emails/?t=1001&akid;=17887%2E878179%2EtbMk5w Click here to unsubscribe:https://act.protectvoting.org/unsubscribe/unsubscribe/?akid=17887%2E878179%2EtbMk5w",D,TRUE

In short, Lisa’s mission of Bright Hope is one she hopes to bring to the Senate. But her self-funding opponent would rather spend nearly a million dollars to keep his campaign afloat and defend the overturning of Roe. I wish I was joking on that last point. The scary thing about all of this is that Delaware will be crucial to the Democrats’ hopes of protecting their Senate majority. With a one-seat majority on the line, we need to do everything we can to lock this seat down and make Lisa the first Black and woman senator from Delaware. Folks – Election Day will be here before you know it. And in order to stop Trump, Vance, and Project 2025, we need to support Lisa Blunt Rochester by chipping in $10 or more to her campaign today.

I really want you to see the whole thing. Please check this out! WATCH PRES. TRUMP’S NM REMARKS » —Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

I’ve really enjoyed hitting the campaign trail and meeting with voters who are fired up and ready to win this race. We’re one step closer to flipping OR-05 and taking back the House. But here's the bad news : We’re up against millions of dollars in spending by deep-pocketed Republicans. My opponent, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, is backed by Republican special interest groups who are willing to spend whatever it takes to hold this seat. As they put more money into this race, we need a flood of support to fight back and make sure we’re not getting drowned out on the airwaves. That's why I'm personally asking: Will you split a donation between Tina Kotek and me today to help us keep our ads on the air and continue to reach undecided voters?

Defeat Boebert PAC,Debbie Mucarsel-Powell,info@defeatboebertpac.com,Your chance to get to know me a little better,11/2/24 18:30,2024,11,2,18,30,defeatboebertpac.com,"Peter — by now, with just 3 days until Election Day, I hope you have a goodsense of who I am and the issues I believe are so important. But I thought alittle reminder would be helpful, especially contrasted with who Rick Scott is🤮.Maybe it will even motivate you to make a donation before tonight'sfundraising deadline to ensure I can defeat Rick Scott! First and foremost,I'm everything I am today because of my mother. She brought my sisters and meto America when I was just 14. Mom knew we had to get out of Ecuador, whichwas transitioning to democracy after suffering under a military dictatorship.She knew America was the key to a better life. Well, with a whole lot of hardwork (including working in a doughnut shop to help my family get by), longhours, and a ton of hope, we were able to win our American dream. My story iswhat inspires me to give back to this incredible country and state that gaveme so much. After putting myself through college, I worked for severalnonprofit organizations across Florida, helping toprotect our wildlife andpreserve our coral reefs. Rick Scott, on the other hand, banned saying thewords ""climate change"" when he was governor of Florida, and the League ofConservation Voters gave him a whopping 0% score last year. During my timeworking at Florida International University, I spearheaded a new programtoexpand affordable health care access to more Floridians. But Rick Scott hasvoted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more times than I care to count. Andwho can forget he committed one of the largest Medicare frauds in the historyof our country. Eventually, I had the honor of serving my community in theU.S. House of Representatives, where I became the first South Americanimmigrant to be elected to Congress! In the House, I wrote the bill toexpandseniors’ Medicare Advantage coverage, worked with Republicans to provideeconomic relief to families and small businesses, andsecured $200 million forEverglades restoration. I'm proud of my record — but can Rick Scott say thesame, friend? He has used his time in office writing the plan to end SocialSecurity and Medicare, attempting to undermine our elections, attacking ourrights, and making it harder for working families to get ahead. As a result,Rick Scott's approval ratings with Floridians are underwater. Even a largepercentage of Republicans don't approve of him! Now, polling shows mestatistically tied with Scott, and in just 8 days, we can defeat him andprotect our Democratic Senate majority in the process. But with Rick Scottoutspending me 3-1 on the airwaves, it's going to take a surge in grassrootssupport from people like you to truly defeat him. So please, rush a donationof $5 or whatever you can to send me to the U.S. Senate and give Floridiansthe true leader and public servant we deserve!

But I’d greatlyappreciate it if you could take the time to read this one. I’m the Chairwomanof the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) – the committeeresponsible with our efforts to win the House, a pro-choice woman with abackground in STEM like many of the candidates 314 Action is supporting, and aproud mom and grandma who wants to leave our kids a better country and planetthan we found it. That means flipping the House to secure a majority that willprotect their rights and their medical autonomy, act on climate, get weaponsof war off the streets, slash child poverty, safeguard our democracy, and keepthe American Dream within their grasp. Democrats are just 4 seats away fromflipping the House blue. But we’re facing a record level of spending by theGOP in this final stretch and polling couldn’t be tighter in the handful ofraces that will decide control of Congress. Your support today is what willmake these races break in our favor. That’s why I’m personally asking if youwill donate directly to 6 Democrats running in 6 toss-up Red-to-Blue Houseraces ahead of their deadlines tonight. If Christina Bohannan (IA-1), Dr.Amish Shah (AZ-1), Janelle Bynum (OR-5), George Whitesides (CA-27), JohnMannion (NY-22), and Tony Vargas (NE-2) win we have the numbers to flip theHouse blue. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kl-email-241018-314?refcode=KL_ATA_EM_FR_314_241025_T1_2_b Christina Bohannan (IA-1) – Christina is anenvironmental engineer and law professor who defeated a 20-year incumbent tosecure a seat in the Iowa State Legislature. In 2020, Republicans flipped thisseat from blue to red by the slimmest margin of any House race in nearly anentire century – a margin of just 6 votes (0.01% of the vote). And pollingconfirms it could be just as competitive this November. Normington, Petts &Associates Poll: Bohannan 47% – Miller-Meeks 47% Dr. Amish Shah (AZ-1) – Amishis an Emergency Room physician at the Mayo Clinic of Arizona and StateRepresentative who had the most bills signed into law of any Arizona Democratof the past decade. In 2022, Republicans barely defended this seat by a marginof just 3,195 votes (which was less than 1% of the vote). It could be evencloser this time around. In 2020, Joe Biden won this district by 1.5%. ImpactResearch Poll: Shah 48% – Schweikert 48% Janelle Bynum (OR-5) – Janelle is anelectrical engineer, small business owner, and former State Representative whohas defeated Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer (who she is now running against)not once but twice at the state level. In 2022, Republicans flipped this seatfrom blue to red by a razor-thin margin of just 2.1% of the vote. In 2020, JoeBiden won this district by 8.8% of the vote – one of the largest margins ofany House seat actively held by a Republican. Noble Predictive Insights Poll:Bynum 43% – Chavez-DeRemer 42% George Whitesides (CA-27) – George is anaerospace expert who served as the Chief of Staff for NASA under PresidentBarack Obama, served as CEO of the spaceflight company Virgin Galactic, andco-founded a group to address wildfire disasters. In 2020, Republicans flippedthis seat from blue to red by a razor-thin margin – just 333 votes (a marginof 0.1% of the vote). In 2020, Joe Biden won this district by a massive marginof 12.4% of the vote – more than almost any other House district currentlyrepresented by a Republican. University of Southern California Poll:Whitesides 48% – Garcia 46% John Mannion (NY-22) – John is a former scienceteacher who won a highly competitive State Senate seat on Republican turf byjust 10 votes to win a seat in the New York State Legislature. In 2022,Republicans barely defended this House seat by a razor-thin margin of just2,631 votes (which is less than 1% of the vote!). In 2020, Joe Biden won thisdistrict by a margin of 7.4% of the vote – which is part of the reason theNational Journal labeled this as the best red-to-blue pickup opportunity inthe United States! Tony Vargas (NE-2) – Tony is a former science teacher andschool board member who currently serves in the Nebraska State Senate. In2022, Tony fell just 5,856 votes (a margin of just 2.6% of the vote) offlipping this seat from red to blue. In 2020, Joe Biden won this district by amargin of 6.4% of the vote and it's only grown more Democratic since.

Thelatest U.N. report shows that while fossil fuel pollution surged to a recordhigh last year, our governments are on track to miss the goals set in theParis Agreement by a wide margin — with warming predicted to reach 2.6–2.8°Cby the century’s end. Every fraction of a degree the planet warms meansdeadlier heat waves, more catastrophic wildfires, and a heartbreaking loss ofbiodiversity.

The U.S. has thepower to set a global standard. If we step up, we inspire other nations toact, too. But if we fail, it becomes harder for any country to hit the targetsneeded to keep our planet livable. Electing climate champions who we canactually urge to act could be the turning point.

Gillibrand for Senate,Debbie,kg@kirstengillibrand.com,A watershed moment for this campaign,11/2/24 18:51,2024,11,2,18,51,kirstengillibrand.com,"Friend, With just 3 days to go until Election Day, and mail-in voting well underway — against a backdrop of recovery after two major hurricanes — I wanted to give you an inside look at where we stand in our race to retire Rick Scott. While I usually wouldn't go into this much detail, I also wouldn't have made it this far without you, so it's only right that you should have full disclosure. But you also need to know that our midnight fundraising deadline is coming up, and I can't afford to fall short on my FINAL $4 million goal — so before we dig in, can I count on you to rush $10 now to split between me and Kirsten Gillibrand and keep me on track to reach my midnight goal and flip Florida blue? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5620-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Date: Nov. 2, 2024 Subject: [INTERNAL MEMO] The Case for Florida's Senate Race At this stage of the 2024 election, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell's race in Florida is now the Democrats' BEST SENATE PICKUP OPPORTUNITY nationwide: * Columnists at The Washington Post report that Rick Scott has failed to write as many of the “massive personal checks that he used to win the governor’s mansion."" * Despite previously self-funding his races at historic levels, Rick Scott has never won an election in Florida by more than 1%. * Debbie's run a highly efficient ad campaign fueled by small-dollar donations, allowing her to reach 76% of voters across Florida's four top media markets. * Recent polls by a GOP-allied firm shows Scott's popularity is tanking by 11 points, and the race is in a DEAD HEAT at Scott 50 - Mucarsel-Powell 48. * Another advantage is the popular ballot initiative for restoring abortion rights, which is expected to help drive turnout similar to that of the 2020 election. * With a personal story that easily counters Scott's ""socialism"" attacks, and regular appearances on Spanish-language media, Debbie can rally Latino voters — nearly 1 in every 4 voters in Florida — unlike any other Senate candidate this cycle. The only thing left that Debbie needs to win is a sizable grassroots cash infusion over these final few days before the election. With it, she can help retain the Senate for Democrats, and bring new leadership to the Sunshine State. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5620-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 # # # So friend, now that you know where we stand in the race, there's just one thing left for me to ask you: Will you please chip in $10, $25, or any amount you can spare now to split between Kirsten Gillibrand and me and help to reach my very last $4 million goal on time, retire Rick Scott, and flip Florida's Senate seat blue? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5620-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for all you do.

That’s the amount I am humbly asking you to give to my campaign to help me defeat Lauren Boebert. Yep, just $5. $5 because last year, Adam Frisch lost to Lauren Boebert by just 546 votes. $5 because now Lauren Boebert has moved to my district, and I am the Democratic nominee running against her. $5 because the polling shows Boebert is still incredibly vulnerable and in danger of losing! And $5 because if we turn this seat blue, Democrats are almost guaranteed to take back the House – and that’s why Lauren Boebert and Speaker Johnson’s Super PACs are attacking me. I know $5 might not seem like much – and to be honest, it’s not. But over 75,000 grassroots donors like you have already chipped in to my campaign, and we are building a grassroots movement to defeat Lauren Boebert – $5 at a time. We cannot stop or let up now. Not when we are so close to giving Boebert the boot. My campaign has set a goal to raise another $30,000 to fight back and defeat Lauren Boebert, but we are still extremely far away with time running out before our critical fundraising deadline. **Please, can I count on you to make a donation to my campaign right now – no amount is too small – to help me defeat Lauren Boebert, flip this seat blue, and take back the House for Democrats?** _Please use the links in this email to start a weekly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  I have been so humbled by the massive outpouring of support my campaign hasgotten from people like you all across the country.But I’m not taking money from corporate PACs, so I need your continued supportnow if we’re going to win and finally defeat Lauren Boebert.Thank you – from the bottom of my heart,Trisha  ********Paid for by Trisha 4 ColoradoTrisha 4 Colorado PO Box 630633 Highlands Ranch, CO 80130Contributions or gifts to Trisha 4 Colorado are not tax deductible.This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

This is one of the last opportunities we have tobreak through before Election Day on Tuesday, so we’ll get straight to thepoint: We’re asking you to contribute to Ruben’s campaign before that deadlinehits. The vast majority of people who read this email won’t give; they’ll lookthe other way. We’re hoping you’re different. As a matter of fact, we need youto be different. As you read this, Ruben is being outspent on television inArizona. After months of missed goals, we haven’t raised what we need tocompete. Kari Lake has more resources at her disposal than we do, and we arefalling behind. The way we retake the momentum is you. If everyone readingthis donated just $5, we would not only fully fund our advertising in thisfinal week. We would not only receive a historic number of donations. We wouldturn this election upside down. We’d raise enough to defeat Kari Lake. UnlikeKari, Ruben can’t depend on a handful of billionaires to bail this campaignout. We’re sustained by the donations of less than 5% of Ruben’s supporters.Without those donations, big or small, we wouldn’t have a chance. That’s whywe need your help. We’re passionate about the way we fundraise becauseultimately this campaign is powered by you. But this late in the race, theonly tool we have to close the gap with Kari Lake and win is with yoursupport. If defeating Kari Lake and holding control of the U.S. Senate seemsworth a donation to you, please take a moment to secure the future of ourdemocracy by chipping in.

Let me explain why: As you read this, Trump and his right-wing allies are outspending us on ads attacking my character and values. They are running them in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. _States that we need to win._ I do not lose sleep over what an unhinged and unstable man thinks about me. What _does_ keep me up at night, is what is at stake in this election and the thought of undecided voters seeing his hate-fueled message before we have a chance to correct the record. **We can and must reach these voters -- and that takes significant resources.** Peter, it looks like you are still waiting for the best moment to donate to our campaign. Will you make today the day you chip in your first $47 or $75? Representing Pennsylvania with a contribution is one of the most meaningful actions you can take in the final days of this election. _If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:_ | | $47 >> --- | $75 >> --- | $100 >> --- | $250 >> --- | $500 >> --- | Other >> ---  Donald Trump is counting on us to lose momentum.I refuse to give him that satisfaction. And from what I know about thisgrassroots team, you will not either.We are still the underdogs in this race. We are going to win, and it is goingto take grassroots supporters like you joining our fight with a donation tomake it happen.That is why I lean on you a bit more on days like today, Peter.Please use this link to chip in $47 ahead of our campaign’s midnightfundraising deadline. Your $47 donation right now -- not tomorrow, not the dayafter, but today -- will directly fund our work to reach and win overpersuadable voters in these final three days.This is the most consequential election of our lifetime.

Ehasz for Congress,Bob Casey,info@ehaszforcongress.com,An important update on my Senate race,11/2/24 19:24,2024,11,2,19,24,ehaszforcongress.com,"Hello, friends. There are just 3 days left, and I wanted to reach out with animportant update on this Senate race. First, can you split $10 between mycampaign and Ashley Ehasz? DONATE [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/eha-email-split-bobcasey?refcode=em_fl_eha_20241102_ta_caseyupdate_surr_xx_30da_xx_pt] A fewdays ago, a poll showed me trailing my Trump-endorsed opponent for the firsttime. Next, experts at the Cook Political Report moved my race to a “Toss Up.”National Republicans see this race as one of their best opportunities toretake control of the Senate, and they’re outspending us in the final days. Ifwe lose this race, Democrats will likely lose control of the Senate and theWhite House. With workers’ rights, women’s rights, and voting rights on theline, we cannot afford for that to happen. So please, split $10 between mycampaign and Ashley Ehasz right now to help reach our final goal and electDemocrats in Pennsylvania.
