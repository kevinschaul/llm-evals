In 2022, Adam Frischnearly defeated Lauren Boebert. He lost by just 546 votes. That scared LaurenBoebert so much that she came running to my district. But the voters ofeastern Colorado don’t want a carpetbagging extremist more concerned withgetting on Fox News than the needs of her constituents. Even Republicans aredone with Boebert: 57% voted for someone else in the primary! We can finallykick Lauren Boebert out of Congress in November, but the only way I’ll be ableto win is if we hit every fundraising goal and have the resources to fullyfund my campaign. We’ve set a goal of raising another $250,000 before ourfinal end-of-month fundraising deadline, but right now, we’re still incrediblyshort.
