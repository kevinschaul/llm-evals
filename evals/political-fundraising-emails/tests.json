In 2022, Adam Frischnearly defeated Lauren Boebert. He lost by just 546 votes. That scared LaurenBoebert so much that she came running to my district. But the voters ofeastern Colorado don\u2019t want a carpetbagging extremist more concerned withgetting on Fox News than the needs of her constituents. Even Republicans aredone with Boebert: 57% voted for someone else in the primary! We can finallykick Lauren Boebert out of Congress in November, but the only way I\u2019ll be ableto win is if we hit every fundraising goal and have the resources to fullyfund my campaign. We\u2019ve set a goal of raising another $250,000 before ourfinal end-of-month fundraising deadline, but right now, we\u2019re still incrediblyshort. So I have to ask: Please, if you can afford to, will you make adonation to my campaign \u2013 every dollar you can spare \u2013 to help me defeatLauren Boebert?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Every dollar you give today will bring us one step closer to finally sendingLauren Boebert packing, and truly no amount you can afford is too small.
